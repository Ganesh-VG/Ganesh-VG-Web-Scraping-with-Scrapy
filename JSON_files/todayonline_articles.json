    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Despite having a successful sales career, a workplace with supportive colleagues, and a stable relationship in Malaysia, Ms Anna Chin still felt something was missing. Commuters at a bus stop next to the Woodlands Checkpoint on Feb 28, 2024. The Malaysian government recently released an official study into Malaysians living in Singapore, and warned of the \"adverse effects\" of the brain drain as skilled workers leave Malaysia. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Despite having a successful sales career, a workplace with supportive colleagues, and a stable relationship in Malaysia, Ms Anna Chin still felt something was missing. And so, like many of her fellow compatriots with big dreams, the Malaysian started considering looking southwards: Singapore. “I got hold of an opportunity from a recruiter, which made me contemplate whether moving to Singapore would be a good decision. “Since Singapore and Malaysia have similar cultures, food, and languages, I thought it would be nice to have the opportunity to work overseas but in a place that doesn’t feel too different from home,” she told TODAY. Ms Chin, who holds a bachelor’s degree in science, thought she could benefit from the regional experience. She had expected to stay in Singapore for just a few years and then head home. Fast forward to six years later, the 33-year-old medical sales executive is now a Singapore permanent resident, happily married to a Singaporean, and is looking for a flat as her forever home here. Considering how her life had taken an unexpected turn since she uprooted herself, Ms Chin said she plans to have children and settle down in Singapore for good. “After moving, I feel less connected to home. I miss my family. It’s a little sad that I am the only one missing out on important events and gatherings like Chinese New Year and birthdays. “But my life is here now, and to the Chinese, it’s customary to follow and stay with your husband’s side of the family,” she said. Ms Chin has three siblings, aged 31, 45, and 48, all still living in their hometown of Ipoh. Ms Chin’s experience will surely resonate with the Malaysian diaspora residing and working in Singapore. Take Ms Audrey Yeap, for example. The 30-year-old, who works as a senior executive in branch operations at a local bank, married a Singaporean citizen after working and living in Singapore for seven years. The Ipoh native moved to the Lion City in 2016 right after graduating from university, having no prior work experience in Malaysia other than a three-month internship in Kuala Lumpur. “When I was just a kid, my parents took me to Singapore for the holidays. Back then, I didn’t know anything about the currency exchange rate or the strength of the dollar. “All I knew was a PlayStation Portable cost about S$200 then, but in Malaysia, it was around RM800. I only understood figures, and thought it would be great to live in a place where I didn’t have to pay so much for things I wanted,” she told TODAY. As she grew older, Ms Yeap eventually realised that earning Singapore dollars would mean increased spending power, thus reinforcing her belief that Singapore was an attractive country to relocate to. Conversely, Malaysian technology startup founder Joshua Lee (not his real name), 40, had never considered moving to Singapore all his life. Still, he found himself mulling over it after being offered the role of chief technology officer at a local firm more than two years ago. “My business was affected after Covid-19, and I had to make a decision to protect the well-being of my staff,\" said Mr Lee, who declined to be named. “So when a Singaporean boss offered to buy my company and relocate me to work for him in the Singapore office, while retaining all 13 workers to work from home in Malaysia, I accepted it.” Last year, Malaysia's then Human Resources Minister V Sivakumar, said that as of 2022, 1.13 million out of 1.86 million Malaysians who migrated abroad were living in Singapore. While Singapore alone absorbs over 60 per cent of Malaysia’s diaspora, most of the remainder reside in countries located on the other side of the world, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Ms Anna Lim, 32, is one of them. Now based in California, she said that many of her friends had left Malaysia for Singapore in search of better pay and opportunities. “Even growing up, I was encouraged to find work elsewhere, such as Singapore or China. Also, I am interested in game development and the entertainment industry, and I am more likely to find a high-paying job in those industries in the US than in Malaysia. “Malaysia still does not value the arts in the way it should, even though many game studios are based there. Unfortunately, money talks,” she said. Before being retrenched recently, Ms Lim, who hails from Penang, was a data analyst at a television technology company in San Francisco. Although many young, bright Malaysians grow up under their home country’s education system, they may harbour dreams and aspirations that cannot be fulfilled at home. Hence, countries as near as Singapore and as far as the US become talent magnets. But what does this mean for Malaysia if a significant proportion of its young, skilled labour force seeks long-term work outside of the country with the possibility of permanent relocation? A Malaysia governmental study in 2022, released last week , revealed that more than half of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore have tertiary-level qualifications. Of those employed here, nearly three in four, or 74 per cent, are skilled and semi-skilled workers. A media statement released by the Malaysian authorities about the study warned of the “adverse effects” of the brain drain as skilled workers leave the country. TODAY looks at the broader implications of this talent outflow on Malaysia’s workforce and economy, and how this may adversely impact Singapore if the phenomenon continues on a greater scale. Malaysians working in Singapore and Brunei are generally attracted by good job prospects, stable employment, attractive salaries, and an advantageous exchange rate, according to the Malaysian government study released on Feb 19. It was conducted by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, an agency under the Prime Minister’s Department, and the Ministry of Economy. On career planning, 62 per cent of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore polled said they would continue working abroad, while the remainder voted for “no” or “not sure”. The study also found that most Malaysians tend to work in Singapore for at least three years, with 33.2 per cent staying for three to five years. Meanwhile, 48.4 per cent have stayed here for six years or more, and 3 per cent have migrated. More than two-thirds of those living and working here earn a gross salary of S$1,500 to S$3,599 a month. However, the study did not indicate the total number of Malaysians surveyed. Ms Ashlyn Ong, 32, has braved the daily commute between Johor Bahru and Singapore for over six years for the sake of enjoying higher spending power thanks to the strong Singapore dollar. “When I left, the exchange rate (of S$1 to ringgit) was around 2.9 or 3.0. Now, it’s at 3.5 and rising. “Earning RM2,500 and S$2,500 is completely different. You can buy a lot more things with S$2,500, but with RM2,500, it’s easily spent with no savings left.” Although she resigned from her position as a customer service officer in Singapore in January to take a break from the toll of the gruelling daily commute, Ms Ong told TODAY that she would still look for another job in Singapore once she is ready to get back to the grind. Ipoh-based beautician Tracey Tan, 33, decided to move to Singapore with her husband in 2018 to work shortly after giving birth to her son. With a combined household income of around RM5,000 (S$1,413) then, the couple needed more savings to ensure they could comfortably bring up their child . In Singapore, she was hired for the same job as a beautician, while her husband was hired as a cook, and they collectively earned around S$5,000 (RM17,600). “We were so fortunate that we decided to come home in January 2020, right before Covid-19, because our son needed to be ferried to kindergarten, and his nanny didn’t know how to drive,” she said. Ms Tan, who now lives and work in Ipoh, said she cherished the opportunity of working in Singapore because she could save a lot more in ringgit after converting her Singapore dollar savings. “If I didn’t have a kid, I would have probably continued working in Singapore because I can get more savings faster and achieve my dream of bringing my whole family for an overseas trip together.” Singapore’s safety and reliable public transport were also pull factors for Ms Yeap, the bank employee . “I love how safe Singapore is. It is also easy to commute everywhere. When I had just arrived here, I could rent a room near my workplace, so commuting to work was a breeze. “(During) my internship experience in Kuala Lumpur before graduation, I had to endure a 1.5-hour jam to get to work and then another 1.5 hours to get home,” she said. For engineer Jonathan Lim, besides Singapore’s strong currency, working abroad has always been on his bucket list and that Singapore is a good starting point. The 27-year-old Kuala Lumpur native said: “I also think I should explore more at my younger age, before having significant commitments such as family and mortgage in Malaysia.” Mr G Peremkumar, 32, a senior staff nurse at a private hospital, said he moved to Singapore almost 10 years ago seeking exposure to a better healthcare system. “The Singapore healthcare system is completely different (from Malaysia), especially in terms of patient experience and patient care,” said the Penang native who worked for over two years as a nurse in Malaysia. “Compared to my experience back in Malaysia, where I didn't think I was learning from the best practices, I get to grow and learn a lot more from the people here who have higher, stricter standards.” In response to TODAY's queries, Ms Janice Foo, head of people at professional services firm KPMG, said that it aims to “attract the brightest minds from anywhere in the world”. It sees a “healthy number of applicants from Malaysia who exemplify these qualities, and many of them have chosen to build thriving careers with us”, she said. “Certainly, employees from Malaysia may see Singapore’s proximity and reputation as a vibrant business hub as factors that are beneficial to them.” With Singapore being the preferred work destination for Malaysians looking to work abroad, Malaysia's chief statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in his statement accompanying the study that the country needs a shift in perspective to address the brain drain. He said it is bound to have an adverse financial effect, considering that a significant portion of those employed abroad had received their education in Malaysia. “Malaysia must reframe the narrative around brain drain, transforming it into a positive concept known as ‘brain circulation’. “This shift in perspective means that the Malaysian diaspora will eventually return to Malaysia after a predetermined period, thereby contributing their acquired expertise and experiences back to the country,” he said. Dr Mohd Uzir also said the Malaysian government needs to adopt a holistic approach — extending beyond the confines of government ministries and agencies — to leverage the “brain circulation” concept as a strategy. He emphasised that efforts should not just focus on bringing Malaysians back to their home country, but also on utilising their skills to benefit Malaysia while ensuring their well-being upon their return. “The ability to reshape the Malaysian labour market will not only bolster the economy but will also, in the long term, exert an indirect influence on factors such as the Malaysian ringgit currency rate, wage levels, and advancements in automation and industrial mechanisation.” Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, in addressing the brain drain issue last September, said that his administration was looking into ways to attract skilled Malaysians to return and contribute to the country. “Top scholars, top economists, top accountants are leaving (the country) or have left, so now we have to make sure that we have a system that could encourage them to come back with the incentives,” he said during a visit to New York. Malaysian and Singaporean economists whom TODAY spoke to said that Malaysia’s brain drain has not reached a dire level yet, but the effects would still be felt in the long term. If left unchecked, the continuous loss of talent would eventually hamper economic growth. Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng said the outflow to Singapore had not adversely affected Malaysia's labour market, given the existing slack. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, there were 187,800 unemployed graduates at the end of 2022, a decrease of 5.5 per cent from the previous year. The graduate unemployment rate was 3.7 per cent, which, according to Dr Yeah, was “marginally lower” than the overall unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent in 2022. “The rise in labour force participation rate, both overall and for graduates — together with the present level of unemployment — suggests that the country’s manpower needs are being met,” he said. Dr Yeah said Malaysia’s current “brain drain” may not be as bad as that experienced during the 1970s and 1980s due to its labour surplus. “It is nevertheless concerning as the outflow of talents could dent the country’s structural upgrading to a higher value, innovation-driven and knowledge-based economy. “In the longer term, the loss of talents could hamper the country’s aspiration to be an advanced and high-income nation,” he said. Dr Yeah, who is one of the five advisers to Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance, added that if not for the loss of human capital, the nation “could well have become developed and achieved high-income status a decade or two earlier”. Associate Professor Alwyn Lim, from the Singapore Management University (SMU), echoed Dr Yeah’s sentiments, saying that Malaysia’s population is “large enough” to mitigate any economic impact from migrating skilled workers. Malaysia has an estimated population of 33.7 million, compared with Singapore’s 5.92 million. “In that sense, I do not see an economic impact large enough to slow down co-prosperity efforts,” he said, referring to Singapore's and Malaysia's economies’ co-dependence. Assoc Prof Lim, however, noted that the economic contributions of nearly a million Malaysian workers are not insignificant. “Many workers in Malaysia can perform lower-skilled work, so the more concerning trend would be higher-skilled Malaysians who choose to work in Singapore, or elsewhere, whose skills cannot be easily replaced and whose value contributions to the economy may be higher. “Higher-skilled Malaysian migration will probably continue to increase, and this will be a limitation for those domestic sectors in Malaysia that rely on the value contribution of higher-skilled Malaysians,” he said. While many of Malaysia’s skilled and semi-skilled workers are eager to seek their fortunes abroad, they are also much sought after by employers in Singapore grappling with rising costs and manpower shortage. Mr Clement Tan, director of Malaysia recruitment agency Talent Recruit, said while he serves clients from various sectors looking to hire Malaysians, healthcare and education stand out in terms of demand. “Cost is the main priority from the clients’ side. Secondly, they feel that Singaporeans can be rather choosy, making it challenging for them to hire Singaporeans, especially for lower-level positions such as operator, retail worker, and kitchen worker,” he said. Mr Jim Wee, director of Singapore-based recruitment firm Nala Employment, said most of his clients would start considering Malaysian candidates for the job if they are unable to hire locally after a month. As the firm specialises in hiring Malaysians, around 90 per cent of its clients, mostly from the manufacturing, engineering, and hospitality sectors, would approach the firm looking for these workers. “Malaysian candidates are often considered the next-best alternative to other nationalities due to the culture and language, which are the closest to Singapore. \"The hiring process is quicker for Malaysian candidates, as they can attend face-to-face interviews within a few days if shortlisted,” said Mr Wee. While it is widely believed that foreign workers are cheaper, Mr Hazmi Zin, a third-generation owner of Rumah Makan Minang restaurant, disputed this, saying it costs about the same for him to hire a local and a foreigner. Malaysians currently make up one-third of his business' 40 workers. “For Malaysian Work Permit holders, the basic salary is around S$1,500, with additional earnings from overtime work. We also need to consider levies, which range from S$350 to S$800, depending on their educational background,” he said. The foreign worker levy is a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreigners in Singapore. Employers must pay a monthly levy for Work Permit holders. Besides the monthly pay, Mr Hazmi also provides lodging, which costs S$500 to S$600 a month per person. In total, a single foreign worker would cost nearly S$3,000 to hire. In comparison, local workers are paid between S$2,000 and S$2,400, excluding Central Provident Fund contributions. Having relied on Malaysian workers for years, Mr Hazmi said their turnover rate can be high because they would go home once they have worked for a couple of years and hit their savings targets. “When given a choice, I would prefer to hire local workers, but because of the nature of the job, it is difficult to operate solely with locals,” he said. The hairdressing industry in Singapore faces similar struggles. Chez Vous salon chief director Serene Tan said while they prioritise Singaporeans in the hiring process, they have no choice but to recruit workers from Malaysia due to a lack of local talent. “Many salons actively seek out locals with hairdressing experience, offering higher pay and benefits to attract them. However, the hairdressing industry is not favoured by Singaporeans, despite offering competitive pay compared to graduates,” she told TODAY. Ms Tan attributed the lack of interest to several factors, such as low starting pay, weekend work, and irregular hours. “Many also perceive the profession of a hairdresser as lower-skilled, or it is for those who ‘cannot study’.” Agreeing with Mr Hazmi’s on the pay issue, Ms Tan said hiring Malaysian workers is not necessarily cheaper due to the foreign worker levies. “In some cases, hiring Malaysians with higher education levels may incur higher costs than hiring locals.” With the rise of remote working, some Singaporean employers look to hire Malaysians to support operations without having to move here. Mr Keith Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Crown Digital, a tech startup behind Singapore’s first robot barista Ella, is one such example. Explaining his decision, he said hiring in Singapore can be highly challenging due to a limited pool of tech talents who seek “premium” salaries upon graduation. “A fresh graduate from NTU (Nanyang Technology University) demanded a pay of S$6,500. The high labour cost in Singapore makes business operations unsustainable, as workers often seek substantial pay increases after a year. “I am looking to Malaysia because of a larger talent pool that does not come at a ‘premium’ cost,” he said. Asked about Malaysia’s brain drain impact on Singapore, Assoc Prof Lim of SMU said the economic migration is largely positive as the Republic’s falling birth rate means it requires more workers from abroad to sustain or accelerate its economy. “There will, however, be increased competition for that stratum of jobs that Malaysians seek in Singapore. Hopefully, this will encourage Singapore workers to add more value to their services or move up the skills ladder,” he said. While Singapore seems to be reaping the economic benefits from Malaysia’s flow of skilled and semi-skilled talent into the country, economists also told TODAY that not everything would be rosy in the long run as the two will need each other to do well in order to thrive. Associate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that with the two economies closely intertwined, the success of one economy often mirrors the success of the other. “Take, for instance, firms headquartered in Singapore that conduct operations in Malaysia. A weak Malaysian economy could directly impact their profitability. “Moreover, as Singapore often serves as a regional hub for business services, any setbacks in Southeast Asian growth diminish its allure as an investment destination. We naturally prefer to see our neighbouring economy thrive, as any slowdown could indicate underlying issues with economic management or structural challenges,” he said. Similarly, Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic adviser at financial service provider CGS International, said that due to the strong intra-regional trade in the Asean region and Singapore's heavy reliance on external trade, any external shock would quickly impact its economy. Asean comprises Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Brunei, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Hence, he said there is a mutual dependency among Asean countries. \"Currently, regional growth is resulting in higher-income jobs, increased disposable income, and greater demand for services. This growth fosters intra-regional trade and spillover effects. \"To Singapore, it is especially important. We want everyone to do well, so they can spend a few hundred dollars here to go to the Taylor Swift concert, for example,\" he said. With all that has been said and done about Malaysia’s brain drain, the question remains: What will it take for the Malaysian diaspora to feel incentivised to return home and contribute to their country’s economy? Audit associate Phua Jia Herl, 25, who has worked in Singapore for almost two years, said Malaysia must first fix its political issues. “If the political parties keep arguing with one another, it shows we are politically unstable. How can we attract foreign investments if that were the case?” The Kuala Lumpur native also stressed that political parties should refrain from exploiting racial issues and move past racial politics. “(Some politicians) often propagate negative videos on platforms like TikTok, inciting hatred towards other racial groups. This divisive behaviour may deter some Malaysians like myself from coming back.” He expressed hope that Malaysia could invest more in infrastructure, such as the rail network, as it would stimulate the economy and bring significant benefits. Mr Lim, the engineer working in Singapore, said there is a need for the authorities to invest not only in infrastructure but also in public services and amenities to improve the overall quality of life in Malaysia. “In the long run, when it comes to the family planning stage, returnees will also look for healthcare facilities for their parents, education systems for future generations, and reliable transportation networks, all of which play important roles in their lives.” Mr Fahad Naeem, country director at recruitment agency Randstad Malaysia, said that when it comes to talent attraction and retention, government initiatives and employer efforts must go hand-in-hand. He said this is especially important after Covid-19, with governments around the world introducing new talent attraction schemes to draw top global talent to work in their countries. “These initiatives help enhance the overall strength of their local workforce and fill the talent pool gap. However, these initiatives must be complemented with attractive career opportunities that companies in Malaysia can offer. “Besides matching salary expectations, many talents are looking for employers that can offer positive employee experiences.” Mr Fahad cited his company’s Employer Brand Research 2023 findings, which found that non-monetary benefits are important to 87 per cent of respondents. He noted that the top non-monetary benefits Malaysians look for are flexible work arrangements, being able to forge good working relationships with their managers and colleagues, and having more autonomy at work. Conversely, Dr Lee Hwok Aun, senior fellow and co-coordinator of the Malaysia Studies Programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said reducing the pay gap is paramount. “Malaysians residing in Singapore and working in semi-skilled and low-skilled jobs can be attracted to return to Malaysia, but it will be a challenge and requires further study. “But I would hypothesise that the job offerings may not be very different across the countries — noting the main semi-skilled occupations in the (Malaysian) study are clerical service work, machine operators, and service and sales workers — and hence earnings differential is the main factor,” he said. While economic factors such as higher salaries, higher spending power and better job opportunities prompted her to move to the other side of the world, San-Francisco-based Ms Lim said one of the reasons she moved to the US was also due to her sexuality. “I am bisexual and married to a woman. Personally, until attitudes towards LGBTQ people change, I don't think I'll be able to return. I would prefer to stay in a country where my marriage is acknowledged,” Ms Lim said, using the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. “Outside of that, money and attitudes towards the arts would potentially sway me to come back — and a nice, heaping plate of char kway teow.” ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY DEBORAH LAU Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Commentary Online harassment has become a pervasive problem in Singapore. Such acts of harassment include cyberbullying and doxxing — the act of revealing someone’s personal details or any other information that can identify them without their consent. Doxxing is the act of revealing someone’s personal details or any other information that can identify them without their consent, such as their name, residential address, email address, phone number, or photograph. This audio is AI-generated. Making online spaces less anonymous makes it easier to hold individuals accountable for harmful actions and deter others from engaging in similar behaviour, says this law expert. Online harassment has become a pervasive problem in Singapore. Such acts of harassment include cyberbullying and doxxing — the act of revealing someone’s personal details or any other information that can identify them without their consent, such as their name, residential address, email address, phone number, or photograph. In the physical world, people are deterred from assaulting others due to the fear of severe legal consequences, such as lengthy imprisonment and even caning. However, the same cannot be said for those who doxx and cyberbully. Despite the lack of formal case reporting, informal platforms including Reddit threads such as r/SingaporeRaw provide glimpses at the negative impacts of such harmful behaviour, including emotional distress and reputational damage. There have also been multiple instances reported of cyberbullying victims driven to suicide — both ordinary, everyday folk as well as celebrities such as K-pop stars Sulli and Kim Jonghyun. In response to growing concerns, doxxing was included as an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (Poha) from Jan 1, 2020. While the Act has offered some recourse for victims since its enactment in 2014, certain areas require further strengthening to effectively combat more forms of online harassment. Currently, most popular platforms, such as Google, Facebook and Reddit have policies which allow victims to put in requests to remove content that harasses or doxxes others. Notwithstanding this, most social media platforms and online forums have complex terms of conditions and content moderation practices that could inadvertently protect the perpetrator at the expense of the victim. This is because what legally constitutes doxxing is still a grey area — as such, these platforms reserve the right to draw and redraw the lines accordingly. Legislative enhancements could provide guidance on how platforms should handle situations where content moderation practices may inadvertently favour the perpetrator over the victim. Such legislative enhancements could institutionalise a standardised framework that govern how online platforms should react to doxxing content, what they should do, and when they should take down offending content. Although reporting systems exist, platforms’ responsiveness to complaints can be inconsistent. Enhanced legislation could set out the timeframe in which platforms must acknowledge and take timely action to remove content that violates anti-doxxing policies. In severe cases of online harassment that cross the line into criminal behaviour, legislation could require platforms to have clear protocols for escalating matters to law enforcement. This would ensure a more integrated approach between platform-level content moderation and the legal system in the most serious cases. Legislative enhancements could also mandate that platforms take proactive measures to prevent doxxing, such as platforms detecting and blocking attempts to share private information without consent. Platforms should also be required to err on the side of victim protection in ambiguous cases while still providing appropriate appeal mechanisms for accused perpetrators. Victims must be required to provide identity documents to prove that they are indeed the affected individuals when submitting a takedown request, in order to ensure it is a legitimate request. The victim should state clearly how the post doxxes them by providing illustrations of how their names, identities, photographs, and other personal information are mentioned. It should also be made mandatory for all platforms that has a nexus to Singapore (such as a pool of Singapore-based users) to collect users’ mobile phone numbers during account registration. In today’s context, mobile phone numbers would be easily traceable to a user. Currently, many online platforms, such as Quora, Reddit and HardwareZone allow users to remain pseudonymous. In 2016, the University of Queensland’s David M Douglas noted that “de-anonymisation might be justified as a means of limiting or stopping such hate speech by increasing the speaker’s accountability”. This means that perpetrators of harassment would not only be more inclined to take down an offending post if their cloaks of anonymity are removed — they may even think twice before harassing others at all. Identification also makes it easier for victims to take legal action, if necessary, against perpetrators. However, once perpetrators’ identities have been privately revealed to victims for the purpose of seeking appropriate recourse, victims should in turn be placed under similar obligations not to publicly expose these identities. Making online spaces less anonymous and more transparent also makes it easier to hold individuals accountable for harmful actions and deter others from engaging in similar behaviour. Poha criminalises various forms of harassment, both online and offline. It empowers the court to issue protection orders and expedited protection orders to stop the harassment and remove related content. While the Protection from Harassment Court aims to make it easier for victims to obtain remedies under Poha, this still involves legal proceedings and victims need to navigate the court process. Claimants who are unfamiliar with legal terminologies, processes or documentation would likely need to engage a lawyer. The idea of new legislative enhancements enabling victims to directly request takedowns of doxxing content from platforms based on pre-defined guidelines, without needing to go through the courts, could potentially fill the gap. Naturally, exceptions would have to be carved out to allow media outlets to report on news. As things stand, without a court order, it is entirely at online platforms’ discretion to accede to or reject requests from victims of doxxing to take down offending posts or to de-anonymise perpetrators. Victims could spend much time and effort wrangling with these platforms in order to remove the offending information. In these cases where the perceived lack of cooperation from online platforms allows perpetrators to avoid any consequences, victims have no other recourse but to give up and resign to their fates. Many victims end up exiting such platforms altogether, thus enabling and emboldening perpetrators to continue harassing others. Enhancing self-help mechanism allows for early intervention and removes the hassle and trepidation of having to go through the court system. The cost to the online platform of removing an offending post upon receiving a complaint is negligible. On the other hand, requiring law enforcement to investigate and then request that the platform take down an offending post is a significant cost to society. Some critics argue that giving victims the power to request that online platforms remove harmful posts is a curtailment of the freedom of expression — but these naysayers fail to understand the very essence of such freedoms. Netizens who harass others to silence them and push them off online platforms and social media are the biggest impediment to freedom of expression. Doxxing on the pretext of individual vigilantism, while often motivated by a desire for justice or retribution, has no place in a well-functioning legal system. Empowering victims is the key to stop and prevent doxxing and cyberbullying. Improved self-help mechanisms would build upon, rather than duplicate, existing platform policies, thus helping to foster a more respectful and safer online community.

At traffic lights, she’d grasp my hand tightly, and remind me that the red man meant “stop” and the green man meant “go”, that I had to look left and right, and that I wasn’t allowed to let go of her hand at all. Not until she said it was okay. Back then, I had to reach up to hold her hand. In my memory, I always looked up at my Ah Ma. She never loomed over me, or seemed too big or too grand, but there was always this slight sense of awe — that this elderly lady was so much older and so much wiser, and someone I could trust to lead me safely. Growing up, I always knew that my Ah Ma loved me. She never said it much — verbal declarations of love were never really a huge thing for her. Instead, she showed it in the little things. In primary school, my younger brother and I were almost always at my Ah Ma’s house. She’d make us lunch after the school bus dropped us off, convinced that the portions served in the school canteen weren’t enough to sustain us. There’s a Bible verse to describe love: “Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.” In Ah Ma’s case, love is also strict. It makes sure that homework is always completed before play, that toys are kept before dinner, and that children are obedient and polite. But her love is also gentle — combing my hair after a shower to ensure that there were no split ends, feeding me snacks as I did my homework, softly patting my back until I fell asleep. Sometimes, though, I wish talking to her was easier. Ah Ma’s first language is Hokkien, and she also speaks Malay, Mandarin, and a handful of other dialects. She understands the bare bones of English — those commonly used words like “school” and “apple” and other things that get said often around her. In contrast, English is my first language. I can hold a conversation in Mandarin, yes, tripping over my words slightly and struggling through the different tones. I can understand bits and bobs of dialect, but I’m hopeless at navigating a conversation without the help of somebody else. This language barrier is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in our relationship. When I was a child, conversations about watering the plants or common household chores were elementary. I’d jabber away in a mixture of Mandarin and English, and Ah Ma would simply just understand. Life was a lot simpler, so communication was also easier. But as I grew up, it has become difficult. Talking to my Ah Ma can turn into an extremely unsatisfying game of broken telephone, going back and forth as we try to decipher the meaning behind each other's words. This only gets worse with more complex topics, especially social issues that youth are passionate about. Understanding mental wellness, for example, is not as simple as using the Mandarin word or phrase for the topic. Things get lost in translation when I explain to her about the importance of mental health, and how it permeates our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, even in a language that she knows well. Time and time again, I run into the same issue — trying to explain why something matters to me as Ah Ma looks on in patient confusion. It’s not that she doesn’t care, or that she’s not smart enough, because she certainly is. But I think she doesn’t understand it the same way I do because we were brought up differently. Ah Ma was born in 1941 in tumultuous times. She was the eldest daughter in a poor family that lived in a kampung and has no formal education. She became a seamstress by trade, and eventually married my Ah Gong, a construction worker who hailed from Fujian. As my family tells me, Ah Ma grew up worried about earning money, about sending her children to school and making sure that there would be food on the table each day. I am fascinated by the stories of her life because they tell me about Ah Ma before I was born. She was the strict mother who pushed her children to study, the thrifty wife that ensured that her family’s needs would always be met. To me, she has always been my sweet grandmother, and it’s so strange to imagine her going through the long, hard life she had before I came along. At times, I wonder how she sees me in return — will I always be the baby she first held years ago, no matter how much I've grown? I was born in 2003, just over sixty years later. I’m also the eldest daughter and my family lives in an apartment. I've never had to even consider giving up my studies to support them, and I can study what I’m passionate about and look for a job in that field. My concerns are more abstract, in a sense. I’m worried about small things, like which university I’ll go to, and how much schoolwork I have, and I’m worried about big things, like global warming and social media addiction and all those other issues that seem to keep popping up. We both care about current affairs or the world around us, but I think it matters to us both in a different way. Ah Ma’s life centred around her day-to-day struggle, and even now, she only remembers historical events in the way they relate to her life. So, the rise and fall of the Berlin wall? To her, it is irrelevant, despite it being a major historical event. Singapore’s “Two is Enough” campaign? Well, it happened when my uncle was born, and she recalls being told off by nurses for having a third child. I can’t blame my Ah Ma for not being interested in the issues that I feel so strongly about, in the same way that she doesn’t blame me for being able to empathise with the problems she had in her life. Is it selfish, I once asked a friend, to want her to care about the same issues as I do? Should I just confine my conversations with Ah Ma to banal retellings of what I did over the week? A part of me recoils at the thought. Ah Ma has always been the person that I’ve gone running to when in trouble, and she’s always significant in my life. I want her to know about the things that I care about. But as I grow older, I also want to learn about her view of the world too. It is about mutual respect, and love, and wanting to do the best thing for the other in our own way. Recently, I bought coffee for Ah Ma — an iced vanilla latte with oat milk. Half of those words are English gibberish to her, but she took a sip anyway. She grimaced and said that it was too bitter and too cold and eventually she told me that I should drink more warm water instead of ‘kopi peng’ (ice coffee). It wasn’t about getting her to like the same coffee as me. It was about letting her have a taste of something that I enjoy, and leaving it at that. I know that she loves me, and because of this, she cares about my life and the things that I like. I will keep trying to bridge the gap with her, to ask her about her life and find our common ground. She is now 81, while I am 19. These days, I’m much taller than her, and a far cry from the six-year-old who she had to escort safely across the road to get to the hawker centre. It’s a sign of the times — a natural progression over the years that shows itself in the little things. It’s also a reminder that as a young adult, I am capable of helping her in the same way she once helped me. Nowadays, I slow my steps to match her pace, just as she did to match mine when I was smaller. I reach out to carry her groceries, the same way she always reached out to carry my school bag in the past. But Ah Ma still holds my hand when we cross the road. Even now, she runs through her checklist of reminders before we cross the road: Look both ways, don’t cross before it turns green, don’t stop to pick up anything lest I get hit by a car, and don’t let go of her hand.

    "article_content": "Voices I’ve always believed in the importance of continuous learning. After all, we live in a world that is constantly evolving, and if we don’t keep up, we risk being left behind. The author, an assistant station manager at the Gardens by the Bay station, is shown communicating with the station's Operations Control Centre to assist passengers with lost and found items (left), and conducting security checks. The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life. In this instalment, Ms Mardhiah Ahmad, 32, describes how she moved from construction to a more challenging role in rail operations through a career conversion programme. Ms Mardhiah, who started her career as a crane operator, says she’s putting her prior work experience to good use as an assistant station manager at SMRT. I’ve always believed in the importance of continuous learning. After all, we live in a world that is constantly evolving, and if we don’t keep up, we risk being left behind. I am an assistant station manager at SMRT Corporation, supporting the day-to-day operations at the Gardens by the Bay station. Before this, I was a crane operator from 2012 to 2018, and a safety coordinator from 2020 to 2022 at a construction site. I graduated from ITE College East in 2010 with a certificate in audio and video production, and completed an advanced certificate in workplace safety and health, which was relevant to my previous jobs, at NTUC LearningHub in 2020. I wanted a more challenging role that would give me better opportunities for career growth. In March 2021, I came across Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Rail Operations Professionals . It is a place-and-train programme offered by SMRT for mid-career individuals keen on joining the rail industry. It has classroom lessons covering topics such as first aid and train service operations. After about five months, trainees go on to become assistant station managers or station managers with SMRT. I was convinced this programme was what I was looking for as it would allow me to venture into a new sector but still put my prior experience to good use. What attracted me most about joining rail operations was the opportunity to operate trains and to learn more about them. As someone who enjoys hands-on work, I was keen to explore the ins and outs of train stations and services. I was employed by SMRT and accepted into the programme in January 2022. Initially, it was difficult for me to catch up with the training, as it had been a while since I had left school. However, I was thankful to be able to grasp the different concepts and skills and relate them to my experience as a crane operator. For example, having a good understanding of how to operate and maintain machines and tools, and being able to remain calm in stressful situations, are relevant in rail operations. I was confident that this would help me to step into the new role successfully. The five-month training helped me better adapt into my role as an assistant station manager. It was a big change from my previous job, but I was excited to take on this new challenge. My responsibilities now include conducting security patrols, providing customer service, and performing duties in the passenger service centre. I also act as an emergency train operator when required and provide support during rail incidents and emergencies. Although my previous construction role had its fair share of leadership opportunities, there were limitations to how much I could contribute, which impeded my ability to showcase my potential as a leader. I feel that I am much more challenged in my current role as it allows me to put the skills I have learned to use on a daily basis. Adjusting to a new work environment can be difficult, but I knew that having the right attitude and beliefs, such as wanting to serve from the heart and always putting commuters first, play a huge part in this industry. Thankfully, with the support of my colleagues and trainers, I was able to cope with the challenges, juggling work responsibilities with family commitments. Not only have I built good rapport with my colleagues, I also feel more valued at work. Both my mother and grandmother are happy with my career switch, too, as they feel that the new role promises better stability and allows room for me to grow and learn. After attending in-house and external training, I hope to take on bigger roles in future, such as becoming a senior assistant station manager or station manager. Through this experience, I’ve learnt that embracing new opportunities can be incredibly rewarding, even if it means getting out of your comfort zone. I’ve gained new skills, made new connections, and have a greater sense of fulfilment in my work. More importantly, I’ve also learnt it’s never too late to start learning something new.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — Before you think of buying a whole box of durian mooncakes, be advised that people may be out to cheat you through online scams, and that it is going to add more fat to your body than eating the fruit itself. Durian mooncakes (left) have more sugar content than durians (right). SINGAPORE — Before you think of buying a whole box of durian mooncakes, be advised that people may be out to cheat you through online scams , and that it is going to add more fat to your body than eating the fruit itself. Durian season lasts from June to anywhere well into October and people have been known to pay top dollar for premium varieties of the tropical fruit. Singaporeans’ passion for the king of fruits can also be seen from their interest in novel durian-infused food — durian shakes, durian hotpot, durian coated with batter and deep-fried, durian paste piped into pastries and wrapped in glutinous rice balls, the list goes on. Their love affair with durian extends even to their dating preferences. A new survey done by Bumble, a dating and social networking application, revealed that more than half of the people in Singapore polled were likely to consume durian this year, with one in five indicating their expectation to savour the fruit while on a date. Another interesting finding was that almost one in three (29 per cent) of durian fans would turn down someone they are romantically interested in if the person did not like the fruit, which is known for its pungent smell and rich flavours that range from sweet to bitter. The survey, done in April this year, polled 500 single people in Singapore aged 18 to 42. Durians can be considered a super fruit because of its high nutrient content. However, if they are packed with so much nutritional goodness, can they replace other fruits? And just how much durian should one eat in a sitting if one is worried about blood sugar levels and weight control? Is it true that one should never mix durians with alcohol? TODAY asked the experts to weigh in on these thorny issues. It is often thought that it is unhealthy to eat durian but the fruit is a rich source of monounsaturated fats, or healthy fats. Ms Bibi Chia, principal dietitian with Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, said that the main benefit of monounsaturated fats is its ability to lower bad cholesterol level, which in turn reduces one’s risk of heart disease and stroke. It is also a myth that eating durian increases cholesterol levels, since it does not contain cholesterol and contains limited saturated fat, Ms Chia said. “When looking to reduce cholesterols levels, other parts of our diet that contributes more fat, cholesterol and calories should be first assessed,” she added. Besides fibre and vitamins such as A, B and C, durians are also rich in potassium, which is essential for maintaining normal functioning of all cells. Potassium maintains the balance of salt and fluid in the body to regulate blood pressure. As an energy boost, durians are a good option. However, people who are watching their weight or have diabetes should be aware that it has a higher calorie and sugar content than other fruits such as apples and strawberries. Dr Anuradha Negi, a specialist in endocrinology and consultant at Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, said that 100 grams (roughly three seeds) of Thai raw durian contain 165 calories and 29g of carbohydrates (equivalent to a bowl of rice). In comparison, 100g of a red apple contains 57 calories and 13g of carbohydrates. Ms Chia said that a 100g serving of durian contains three to four times the amount of carbohydrates than strawberries. If you were to devour an entire small durian weighing about 600g, that would mean consuming about 990 calories — although this may vary depending on the variety. This is around half the daily calorie intake recommended for an average adult. The high sugar content in durian will also cause blood glucose spikes when consumed excessively, Dr Negi said. For people living with diabetes, uncontrolled and repeated blood sugar spikes can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, blindness, nerve damage and kidney problems. It is not unusual for durian lovers to indulge in five or even 10 to 20 seeds at one go, but that would be considered excessive. The experts advised limiting durian intake to one to three seeds every day, as one of the two daily servings of fruit. For diabetics, limit durian intake to no more than two seeds a day. Ms Chia advised having them between meals to avoid sugar spikes and to avoid overloading the meal with too much carbohydrates. The size of each durian kernel matters, too. For example, the Red Prawn and Black Pearl varieties tend to have smaller seeds. “Those with smaller seeds tend to have more flesh. This means that you will consume more calories and carbohydrates by eating more smaller seeds,” she said. If you must have durians, it is recommended to eat two seeds of the fruit every day as part of a healthy diet, but switch around with other types of fruit. “Having a variety of fruit in our diet can help provide different nutrients. “Fruits like durian and banana are higher in carbohydrates and should be eaten in moderation,” Ms Chia added. Consuming too much durian and alcohol together may cause uncomfortable side effects. Depending on one’s tolerance, alcohol can cause nausea, bloating and dehydration, while overeating durians can lead to bloating and sugar spikes, Ms Chia said. It is also thought that mixing the two may worsen hangovers, a set of symptoms that occur as a consequence of drinking too much alcohol. Typical symptoms are fatigue, excessive thirst, nausea, headaches, muscles aches and weakness. Dr Negi explained that durians contain sulphur compounds that are known to slow the metabolism of alcohol in the body. This can potentially exacerbate alcohol-related intoxication. At the same time, the liver also has to process the fat and sugar content in durian. Studies in mice have not shown any conclusive evidence and more studies are required to understand the effects of durian on alcohol metabolism, but it would be prudent to avoid mixing the two, Dr Negi added. It is worth mentioning that durians contain the amino acid tryptophan, which the body uses to make melatonin and serotonin. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, while serotonin plays a role in regulating body functions such as mood, sleep, digestion and even appetite. Would consuming durian promote better sleep then? The jury is still out on this. Dr Negi said that a study analysing the tryptophan content in three different varieties of durian found that it is present only in the Musang King variety — but in low amounts. “We cannot conclude with certainty that durian positively affects sleep,” she said. If you are having sleep problems, you should avoid consuming too much fatty food such as durian, and eating it too late in the evening because that will affect digestion. Try other sleep-promoting habits instead. For example, improving your sleep hygiene and limiting caffeine intake in the afternoon or evening. When choosing between eating the fruit and a durian puff or cake to get your durian fix, opt for the fruit itself. Durian-infused treats and beverages are typically laden with way more sugar, (not-so-good) fat, carbohydrates and calories than the real deal. For example, one raw durian seed contains 55 calories and 1.7g of fat but a small durian puff (30g) can easily contain more than 70 calories and almost 5g of fat. As for that entire piece of durian mooncake (about 200g), it has more than 800 calories and around 42g of fat. “Enjoy these novelty foods only once in a while and limit the portion size,” Ms Chia said. People are often advised to drink salt water from a durian husk after eating the seeds to get rid of the smell and to reduce “heatiness”. Is there any truth to this? Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) physician Tay Jia Yin from Raffles Chinese Medicine said that from a TCM perspective, durian is considered a “heaty” food. This means that it has “warming” properties that can lead to undesirable symptoms such as sore throat, mouth ulcers and increased phlegm production when people consume too much of it. TCM practitioners believe that salt water has the effect of reducing the heaty effects of durian, but there is no basis to support the practice of drinking it from a durian husk to get rid of the smell, Ms Tay said. People may also consider pairing durians with mint tea, chrysanthemum tea, green tea or coconut water to counter its “heaty” effects, she added.

    "article_content": "World PARIS — Bystanders are less likely to give life-saving CPR to women having a cardiac arrest in public than men, leading to more women dying from the common health emergency, researchers said on Monday (Sept 18). People receive CPR training as they practice on dummys during a civil defence drill against possible artillery attacks by North Korea, in a subway station in Seoul on Aug 23, 2023. PARIS — Bystanders are less likely to give life-saving CPR to women having a cardiac arrest in public than men, leading to more women dying from the common health emergency, researchers said on Monday (Sept 18). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) combines mouth-to-mouth breathing and chest compressions to pump blood to the brain of people whose hearts have stopped beating, potentially staving off death until medical help arrives. In research to be presented at a medical conference in Spain this week, but which has not yet been peer-reviewed, a team of Canadian doctors sought to understand how bystanders administer the procedure differently to men and women. They looked at records of cardiac arrests that took place outside of hospitals in the United States (US) and Canada between 2005 and 2015, which included nearly 40,000 patients. Overall, 54 per cent of the patients received CPR from a bystander, the research said. For cardiac arrests in a public place, such as in the street, 61 per cent of women were given CPR by a bystander — compared to 68 per cent of men. Dr Alexis Cournoyer, an emergency physician at the Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal who conducted the research, told AFP that this gap \"increases women's mortality following a cardiac arrest — that's for sure\". Cardiac arrests are a leading cause of death, with more than 350,000 occurring in the US alone every year, according to the American Heart Association. Only around 10 per cent of people who have a sudden cardiac arrest outside of a hospital survive, research has shown. The researchers sought to find a reason for the gender gap. One theory was that bystanders in public could be uncomfortable touching a woman's breast without consent, Dr Cournoyer said. The researchers looked into whether age could play a role, he added. But it did not — women were less likely to receive CPR than men from a bystander regardless of their age, the data showed. Dr Cournoyer said another possibility was a \"barrier of recognition\" for women having a cardiac arrest, which is often represented as something that happens only to men. Before a cardiac arrest, men are more likely to have chest pain — a commonly depicted symptom in media — while women are more likely to experience shortness of breath, according to a study published last month in Lancet Digital Health. Dr Cournoyer said further research was required to shed light on the gap between men and women, in particular involving data on the gender of those performing CPR. The research, which the team plans to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, will be presented at the European Emergency Medicine Congress 2023 in Barcelona.

Gen Y speaks profile Garialdi Salim. Last year, I decided to join an online reality dating show called One Week Love. The show premiered on The Smart Local’s YouTube channel in October 2022 and follows a similar format to Netflix’s Singles’ Inferno, where nine contestants try to find love in seven days. The show grew in popularity, striking a chord, especially with the Gen Zs, who were waiting in anticipation for a new up-and-coming dating reality show. And while I would gladly go through this experience of being on a trendy online show all over again, I’m not sure if I can confidently say that this is an experience for everyone. When I first heard about the casting call, I jumped at the opportunity, just because of how different I knew this experience would be from my day job. I am a senior strategy and consulting analyst at Accenture, a global professional services firm. In my role, I work closely with clients, dedicating extensive time to conducting in-depth research and assisting them in tackling complex business challenges. Life on a “reality” show and my actual day-to-day reality seemed to be worlds apart. I thought One Week Love came at an opportune time, right when I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people. After all, how many 27-year-olds can say that they have been a contestant on a reality dating show before? So, while I went in thinking I would be the carefree spirit who would go home with a date to call their own, the story changed when the cameras went on. Reality shows feed on drama, and I knew that when I signed up. But I just never expected myself to be caught in the series of developments that ensued. For example, in the earlier episodes where my castmates thought I was being “too close for comfort” because I was helping another female castmate adjust her microphone. In the later episodes, I was called out by one of my castmates as the one who really “needed to work on their social cues” during a segment called “Unfine Dining”, where castmates have to pick between answering a difficult question or be forced to eat a nauseating dish. But it was the overall narrative that I had no control over, and I was at the mercy of the producers and editors. To keep the long story short, I gradually became seen as the antagonist. Whether that is fair or not, I would leave readers to judge if they happen to watch the show. But I wanted to pen this piece, perhaps as an epilogue to the series, but also to put it out there about what life was like for me after the cameras turned off. It was demoralising being perceived as the antagonist, but I continued believing in myself and my intentions. I admit to initially being upset when I realised what was happening. I chose to bite my tongue and held back the desire to go into defensive mode, opting instead to hear them out, which helped defuse the situation. With all cameras on you, every micro-expression was captured. I didn’t know what other castmates thought of me at the time, but I knew my actions and how I reacted were within my control. I watched the show when it finally got posted online several months later. Listening to the participants describe their first impressions of me was quite a surreal experience, akin to hearing your recorded voice for the first time. But I was also nervous about how I would be perceived, and indeed, it was initially quite shocking scrolling through the comments and reading what the public thought of me. I wasn’t portrayed in the most positive light by the ladies in the show, several comments popped up in the earlier episodes on my behaviour, with some even calling me a “creep”. To be honest, those comments stung. But I kept my head in check and chose to put those comments aside. I told myself that how I was portrayed in the show was not a definition of who I really was as an individual. Nonetheless, I watched these episodes with a bunch of friends or had watch sessions with my fellow castmates, as it made it easier to be less self-critical of my performance. Having the company also made the experience less confrontational, and more manageable. Nearly ten months after the show was broadcast, I’ve gotten past most of these comments. It helped that #JusticeforGari eventually became a trending term nearing the final few episodes when people started realising how severely misunderstood and misrepresented I was on the show. I felt vindicated by the hashtag and the positive public comments about me that flooded the comments section. Thank goodness for those. Coming out of the show, while I did not “find love” as I had initially expected, I found myself in the company of the few castmates who I can now call my friends. I’m also incredibly proud of the experience I’ve gained on the show — I stuck to my guns, and was authentically “me”, and I wouldn’t have changed anything even if I were to do it all over again. At my job at Accenture, I learnt that a consultant’s first impression is almost as important as the strength of their counsel in building trust with and gaining the respect of our clients. Though I was intimately familiar with the importance of perception, I realised from my experience on the show that as hard as I tried, I could not control how I was going to end up being perceived. Even though I have learnt to peg this roller-coaster of an experience as being a part of “show business”, I cannot deny the struggles of having to maintain public perceptions, especially when it is amplified across social media, and spotlighted in the public’s eye. Safe to say, I’ve not just taken a step out of my comfort zone when I decided to join One Week Love, but I’ve run deep into the horizon with it. From the show, one of my greatest takeaways is learning that most of the time, all we can do is roll with the punches, learn from our mistakes, and aim to emerge a better person, a mindset that I’ve carried with me till now in my day-to-day life.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Over the past decade, the number of people diagnosed with \"neurodivergence\" has risen, studies around the world have shown, with as many as 8 per cent of adults globally having some form of this condition. Viewing neurodivergence as a difference rather than a disability contributes to an inclusive workplace where people’s strengths are recognised and celebrated. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Over the past decade, the number of people diagnosed with \"neurodivergence\" has risen, studies around the world have shown, with as many as 8 per cent of adults globally having some form of this condition. Neurodivergence is a non-medical umbrella term that describes people with variations in their mental functions. Some known conditions that come under this category include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and dyslexia. Global studies reflect a rise in prevalence of these conditions, although according to the World Economic Forum, the reasons for this increase are complex and not fully understood. Some possible factors that have been proposed include better awareness and screening for autism, changes in diagnostic criteria, and environmental or genetic factors. A 2022 study published in the Journal of the Missouri State Medical Association in the United States found an increase in the prevalence of ADHD in the whole US population, from 6.1 to 10.2 per cent, in a 20-year period from 1997 to 2016. Another study in 2019, also of the US population, found a 123 per cent increase in ADHD prevalence among adults reported between 2007 and 2016. Even though ADHD, autism and dyslexia are some of the conditions most frequently classified under neurodivergence, a 2020 study on neurodiversity at work highlighted other associated mental heath conditions such as depression, anxiety and Tourette syndrome. Some experts also suggest that obsessive-compulsive disorder is neurodivergent because of the hyperactivity in certain brain regions and its cognitive patterns which are similar to the repetitive behaviours seen with autistic individuals. While overall figures for Singapore are not available, various organisations and clinical psychologists said they have observed an increase in the number of clients seeking help in recent years for various neurodivergent conditions. In 2018, the Dyslexia Association of Singapore said the number of students in one of its intervention programmes tripled over the preceding decade. It had 3,115 primary and secondary school children enrolled in its Main Literacy Programme, up from 1,032 in 2007. According to a report in The Straits Times from 2023, estimates based on data from public hospitals seem to suggest that there has been an increase in the prevalence of ASD over the years, too. According to a study published in the Singapore Medical Journal in 2021, the number of children identified to have ASD increased from 721 in 2014 to 1,279 in 2019. Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at the psychological consultancy Mind What Matters, said his clinic now sees an average of one new referral or enquiry for neurodivergence-related concerns every month, up from once every two months last year. Dr Praveen Nair, senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, has also seen an increase in patients visiting his clinic for neurodivergence-related concerns. He said: \"It is hard to quantify but a rough estimate would be a 20 per cent increase in the last five years.\" For Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist at The Therapy Room, she attributes the increase in patients due to more awareness through education and social media. “There is no firm number but it has been steadily increasing since Covid in different areas of ASD adults, LGBTQ+ and adults with learning disabilities,” she said. What else do we know about neurodivergence, and how can we help those who have such conditions? TODAY spoke to mental health experts to find out. Dr Yang said that neurodivergence broadly refers to people who have different strengths and struggles from people whose brains develop or work more typically. The term was first developed to define those on the autism spectrum, but has since been applied to people with other neurological or developmental conditions such as attention deficit disorders, or specific learning disabilities like dyslexia, said Dr Yang. “Seeing this, more recently, neurodivergence has been sometimes used in the context of some mental disorders, such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This fits within the definition as an individual suffering from OCD may have their brain functioning and mental state significantly affected by a cycle of obsessions and compulsions.” People suffering from OCD experience the symptoms of obsession, defined as recurrent persistent ideas, thoughts, images or impulses. To reduce anxiety and find relief from these unrelenting obsessions, a person may develop compulsions or behaviours. Some signs of neurodivergence may include: Dr Timothy Singham, clinical psychologist at Viriya Psychological Services, said: “Often, these are accompanied by a sense of not fitting in with one’s immediate environment. These experiences often surface from a young age. “It is very important to note, however, that there are many different factors that could account for these symptoms, and therefore seeking a professional opinion is paramount.” Dr Yang agrees that neurodivergence can be spotted at a young age, when a child is seen as not behaving or socialising “normally” with peers. “As these youth grow older, others and society become less forgiving and intolerant of their differences. Many struggle with feelings of loneliness and not fitting in.” Neurodivergence often affects one’s work and relationships greatly, according to Dr Singham. For instance, one might struggle to cope with the demands of multi-tasking at work, or might find certain workplace environments particularly challenging to work well in. “There is also an often underestimated impact that neurodivergence can have on relationships,” Dr Singham said. “Research has shown that those with neurodivergence experience a lower quality of relationships both at work and among family and friends, and this can cause a great amount of psychological distress.” This could be due to factors such as mismatched expectations, communication difficulties, difficulties in reading, expressing and regulating certain emotions. Dr Yang added that some neurodivergent people struggle because they do not fit into normal societal systems. Dr Singham emphasised the importance of being open to listen to the experiences of those who have neurodivergence. “People with neurodivergence are often misunderstood by people around, so do not underestimate the impact that a listening ear can have,” he said. “It is also important to listen to their own unique experience, as neurodivergence can manifest in many different ways and no two individuals are exactly the same.” At the workplace, Dr Singham said that it is important for companies to have policies that enable the flexible provision of specific accommodations for people with neurodivergence. Apart from policies, companies must embrace a culture of inclusivity and respect for everyone. Dr Yang said that others can learn to be more patient in general and allow those affected the chance to express themselves more and opportunities to demonstrate their strengths.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — After learning how to fix dental veneers from her former employer, Ding Zhiyan started her own salon at Far East Plaza and provided these services between 2022 and 2023. Ding Zhiyan (front, centre) leaving the State Courts on May 14, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — After learning how to fix dental veneers from her former employer, Ding Zhiyan started her own salon at Far East Plaza and provided these services between 2022 and 2023. In one instance, she fixed her customer's veneer in her home after the veneer dislodged a day after she installed it. A dental veneer is a thin layer of material placed over a tooth. On Tuesday (May 14), the 37-year-old Chinese national pleaded guilty to two counts of practising dentistry despite not being a registered dentist. She was fined S$5,000. Another four similar charges were taken into consideration. Ministry of Health prosecutor Tan Luoyi told the court that Ding, who is in Singapore on an S Pass, had learnt how to provide dental veneer services from her former employer at a salon in Bugis sometime in 2020 and would provide the services. She left the salon in February 2022, before setting up her own business at Far East Plaza along Scotts Road in May 2022. To provide dental veneer services, Ding purchased her equipment and supplies from e-commerce platform Taobao for 2,000 yuan (S$370). Ms Tan said as part of the veneer fixing service, Ding would check if customers had cleaned their mouths. Then she would ask her customers to rest on a bed or sofa, clean their teeth and file them to remove any plaque. After ensuring their teeth were clean, Ding would apply adhesive gel on the teeth before putting the dental veneers in place. Ding would then apply another gel to protect her customers' gums before shining UV light to harden the adhesive. Ms Tan told the court that on May 13, 2022 at about 2.33pm, Ding was informed that three dental veneers she installed on a customer in March 2022 had fallen off. Ding then arranged to meet the customer two days later at her salon and fixed them for S$100. Later that year on Dec 10, Ding performed her dental veneer service on another customer. However, the dental veneers dislodged and the customer complained. Ding arranged to meet the customer at her home in Bukit Merah the next day. There, Ding fixed the tooth during a 30-minute procedure for no charge as it was a \"form of service recovery\", said Ms Tan. The prosecution sought a S$2,500 fine for each charge Ding pleaded guilty to. This took into account the fact that Ding had fully cooperated with the authorities during investigations and had pleaded guilty at an early stage. Ms Tan added that Ding has not had any brushes with the law previously. Ding asked for a low fine amount as her mother has cancer and she needed money for medical expenses. In her brief sentencing remarks, District Judge Lorraine Ho acknowledged that no actual harm was caused to Ding's customers, although they needed \"some touch up\". For practising dentistry without a practising certificate and not being a registered dentist, Ding could have been fined up to S$25,000.

A photograph of Changi Point Jetty. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A man was sentenced to six years of corrective training nearly eight years after he fled Singapore by paying a Malaysian boatman S$6,000 to avoid jail. Loh Ping Huang, now 50, had been on bail for beating up a man and leaving him in a vegetative state, when he hit another man with a flowerpot. He pleaded guilty last month to a charge each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon and leaving Singapore at an unauthorised place of embarkation. He also pleaded guilty to being a member of a secret society from 2010 to 2022, and also for inviting a person to join the gang. Another six similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Corrective training is a form of long-term incarceration to reform offenders and correct behaviours. It involves serving jail time for up to 14 years and is generally imposed on recalcitrant offenders who commit serious offences. Loh's sentence was backdated to Sept 26, 2022 when he was first remanded. According to court documents, Loh was accompanying a woman in her 20s to her home along Lorong 30 Geylang after a night of drinking on June 12, 2015. At about 7.15am, Loh, who was heavily intoxicated, thought that a man in his 60s was staring at the woman. Loh shouted at the man to leave, but he did not. The pair got into a verbal argument. The man picked up a plank and tried to swing it at Loh, but Loh punched the man repeatedly in the face, causing the man to drop the plank. As a result of the fight, the man was left in a vegetative state up until his death on July 25, 2019. An autopsy later showed that his death was caused by pneumonia complicated by a head injury. An underlying heart disease was also found to be a contributory cause of death, court documents stated. Loh was charged on June 13 in 2015 for the attack. While on bail, he got into a fight at a pub in Geylang on July 9, 2016. During the fight, he picked up a flowerpot and smashed it on a man's head, leaving him with bruises. Loh decided to flee Singapore sometime in mid-2016 to avoid going to prison for his crimes. Loh paid a Malaysian boatman S$6,000 to help him leave Singapore illegally. He boarded a boat near the Changi Point Jetty in order to reach Johor, Malaysia. Court documents did not state how the boat evaded detection by the Singapore authorities. Loh stayed in Malaysia for about three years before he decided to leave for Vietnam as he feared he would be arrested by Malaysian police and sent back to Singapore. To get to Vietnam, he stowed away on buses that went through Thailand and Cambodia, stated court documents. Loh stayed in Vietnam until he was arrested by the Vietnamese authorities and taken back to Singapore on Sept 26, 2022. In total, he was on the run for six years. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Timotheus Koh called for a corrective training suitability report last month, noting that Loh's \"history of lawlessness and violence\" and his absconding while court proceedings were ongoing showed the severity of the case. Loh's past offences include rioting with a deadly weapon and voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in 2000. For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Loh faced up to 10 years' jail and a fine or caning. For voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon, the penalty is a maximum of seven years' jail, fine and caning For being part of a secret society, Loh could have been jailed for three years or fined S$5,000, or both. For leaving Singapore at an unauthorised place of embarkation, he could have been jailed up to six months or fined S$2,000, or both.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For more than a year, Chua Hock Hua used different bank accounts to help unknown parties he met online to transfer funds to other people he also did not know personally, in exchange for a cut of the sums transferred. At one point, after his accounts were frozen and he had been warned by the authorities to stop such transactions, Chua even used an ex-colleague’s account to continue to do so. On Tuesday (June 11), the 59-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to two years and three months’ jail. Chua, who had no legal representation, pleaded guilty to five counts of assisting another party to retain benefits from criminal conduct. Three related charges were taken into consideration during the sentencing. In total he had helped to launder almost S$410,000. The court heard that in January 2022, a police report was lodged over a POSB bank account belonging to Chua. He had used the account to receive monies on behalf of someone he met online and remitting the funds overseas. After investigations, the police issued Chua an advisory to refrain from dealing with funds from unknown or dubious sources. He was advised that if he continued doing so, he would be liable for money laundering. In October that year, Chua got acquainted with a person on Facebook known only as “Donald”. Chua confided in him that he owed about S$16,000 to moneylenders. Donald proposed that Chua provide him his bank account for Donald to use for transferring money. In return, Chua would get a 3 per cent cut of the funds being moved. Chua agreed and provided Donald with details of his UOB bank account. Chua would withdraw the monies transferred there and pass the cash physically to another person known only as “Andy”. The UOB account was frozen on Dec 1, 2022 following a police report. “The accused thus had reasonable grounds to believe that Donald was a person who was engaged in criminal conduct, and that the monies he received on Donald’s instructions were Donald’s benefits of criminal conduct,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li. In spite of this, Chua provided two more bank accounts — with HSBC and Maybank — to Donald so that he could continue to earn the 3 per cent commission. These accounts were frozen after victims of online scams lodged police reports, stating that they were duped into transferring money into those two accounts. “The monies that the accused received in the bank accounts, and which he withdrew and handed to Andy, were thus Donald’s benefits of criminal conduct,” said the prosecutor. After the freezing of the UOB account, Chua was summoned by the police to assist with investigations. He was told that the bank accounts provided to Donald had been used to receive proceeds from criminal conduct. Despite the warnings, Chua opened two more bank accounts — with OCBC and POSB — in May and August 2023 to continue his arrangements with Donald. And when these accounts were frozen, Chua in February this year approached an ex-colleague of his to receive money to be handed over to Andy. Chua promised him a 4 per cent cut of the funds transferred, but he did not tell the ex-colleague that his own accounts had been frozen for carrying out such activities. On Tuesday the prosecutor told the court that the ex-colleague was given an advisory by the police not to repeat the conduct. For each count of assisting another party to retain benefits from criminal conduct, Chua could have been jailed up to 10 years, fined up to S$500,000 or both.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Back when he was in active service as a ranking officer in the Singapore Police Force, Rama Shanker Singh groped two police full-time national servicemen (NSFs) under his charge on separate occasions. A file photo of the State Courts building in Singapore. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Back when he was in active service as a ranking officer in the Singapore Police Force, Rama Shanker Singh groped two police full-time national servicemen (NSFs) under his charge on separate occasions. His actions in the early 2000s left the two male victims feeling humiliated and helpless, though they did not alert anyone to the incidents at that time because they were afraid to report a superior officer. On Wednesday (June 12), some two decades later, Singh’s actions caught up with him and he was sentenced to 24 days’ jail and a fine of S$20,000. He faces another 20 days' jail if he fails to pay the fine. Earlier this month, Singh, now 60 and retired from the force, pleaded guilty to two counts of using criminal force on the victims and one unrelated offence of possessing obscene films. One charge of outrage of modesty was dismissed amounting to acquittal, while four other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The names of the victims cannot be disclosed due to a court order to protect their identities. District Judge Teoh Ai Lin took into account as aggravating factors Singh’s abuse of authority and the fact that he had used criminal force on each victim more than once. Court documents showed that Singh was a police officer from May 1984 to June 2016 and last held the rank of a superintendent before retiring. Among the postings he held were as chief investigation officer at Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters (F Division) from August 2002 to August 2004. The first victim, now aged 42, served his National Service (NS) there as a crime administrative clerk at the time of the offence in 2003. Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPPs) Tay Jia En and Gladys Lim said: “Prior to the offence, (the first victim) respected the accused and had a positive view of him because he had witnessed the accused standing up for the police NSFs in the crime registry who were working under the accused.” Sometime that year, while the first victim was seated alone in a conference room collecting some investigation papers, Singh entered the room and closed the door behind him. He stood behind the victim and massaged his shoulders while telling him that he was attracted to him. Singh then kissed the top of the victim’s head while touching the victim's private parts over his clothes for a few seconds without consent. “He did not know how to react as he was being touched by his supervisor. He also did not think that men would be the subject of such offences,” the prosecution said. The victim left the room, feeling shocked and helpless, but did not report the matter because he was concerned that the completion of his NS may be jeopardised if he reported Singh, who was his supervisor and approving leave officer. Sometime between 2005 and 2006, the second victim was posted to the Security and Inspectorate Regulatory Department (SIRD) as part of his NS. Singh was posted there as head of compliance management. Singh reached out to the second victim’s direct supervisor and asked for the NSF to be attached to his team to assist him in conducting an outfield audit. At one point, the second victim was in a police saloon car with Singh. He was seated at the front passenger seat while Singh was the driver. While he was driving, Singh placed his left hand on the victim’s groin area and caressed the victim's private parts over the trousers. Singh withdrew his hand when the NSF said that he was uncomfortable about the action, but he did it again later. “(The second victim) felt angry and outraged by the accused’s actions but chose to keep quiet as the accused was his supervisor and senior officer,” the prosecution said. It added that the victim felt “embarrassed, ashamed, and humiliated as he was physically strong yet felt that he allowed the accused to touch him in that manner”. Court documents stated that the police were informed in December 2020 that Singh had allegedly committed the offences against the first victim during the latter’s NS days. After Singh was arrested that month and his electronic devices were seized, 170 obscene films were found. Seeking a short custodial sentence, DPP Tay on Wednesday said that Singh had abused his position of authority as a ranking officer in the police force. He added that the victims had felt “powerless” to report him for his actions. DPP Tay also said that there is a “concomitant need” to deter such offences, because victims of such acts would usually experience shame and would be reluctant to step forward to lodge a report, making such acts hard to detect. He added that Singh was persistent in his act, noting that there were similar charges taken into consideration, and that the nature of the touches were “highly intrusive” since they were at the victims’ private regions, albeit over clothes. Defence counsel Ramesh Tiwary, in pleading for a fine instead for his client, pointed to Singh’s clean criminal record before and after the offences. He said that Singh was also not the victims’ direct supervising officer, and maintained that the touches were for a few seconds and not prolonged unlike other more serious cases. He also said that his client would like to apologise to the two officers concerned over his behaviour. District Judge Teoh agreed with the prosecution's position that the threshold for a custodial sentence had been crossed for the use of force offences, given the aggravating factor. \"The offences had been committed in a workplace context by a higher ranking officer against victims who were NSFs working in a hierarchical environment,\" she said. For each count of using criminal force, Singh could have been jailed for up to three months or fined up to S$500, or both. For possession of obscene films, he could have been jailed for up to six months or fined up to S$20,000, or both.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For years, Ryosuke Tanaka went to different dental clinics to get treatments and services worth anything from hundreds of dollars to almost S$3,000. After the treatment but before making payment, he would excuse himself to go to the toilet outside the clinic, never to be seen again. He could not be contacted after that as well. In all, he skipped more than S$7,000 in payments. On Wednesday (June 12), the 36-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to five months’ jail, after pleading guilty to three counts of dishonestly obtaining services. Four similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Court documents showed that Tanaka sought root canal treatment from a dental clinic on Jan 18 this year. Although the name and full address of the clinic was not disclosed in court documents, the postal code showed that it was located in the Orchard Road area. Before the treatment, the dentist had explained to Tanaka the cost and number of appointments required for the treatment plan. Tanaka signed a form indicating the estimated costs. After a root canal procedure that lasted roughly two hours, Tanaka was asked to make payment of S$1,580.50. He told the clinic's workers that he was going to the toilet located outside the premises, left without making payment and did not return. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Cheronne Lim said that the clinic called four different contact numbers previously provided by the accused and sent messages via WhatsApp but did not receive a reply from him. She added that the dental clinic had provided treatment to Tanaka on four occasions in September last year and received payments for those. The dentist made a police report about the Jan 18 incident the next day. Tanaka repeated the same modus operandi at different clinics on Jan 23 and March 22 this year, with one of the treatments worth almost S$2,960. Each of the clinics filed police reports about the incidents. In addition to these incidents, Tanaka also obtained dental services worth more than S$2,200 at three clinics on four occasions from May 2020 to October 2022. Court documents did not state if police reports were made over these incidents, which formed the basis of the charges taken into consideration in sentencing. DPP Lim said that some of the services rendered to Tanaka were “semi-surgical” and the costs were significant. His actions also caused distress on the clinic's work crew who had to look for him in nearby toilets. They also tried to contact him multiple times. In mitigation, his defence lawyer Noelle Teoh said that the way he had cheated the clinics was not sophisticated and he did not make effort to conceal his act, since his personal and contact details were available to the clinics. She also highlighted that he had made restitution to all the clinics. For each count of obtaining services in a dishonest or fraudulent manner, Tanaka could have been jailed for up to 10 years or fined, or both.

A GrabMap employee walks past blocks of HDB flats in Tengah while wearing a camera backpack used to map walking paths. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Amid grouses by the first batch of Tengah residents on the lack of amenities and transport options, Grab on Thursday (June 13) said it is mapping out the town on foot and by car as it is being constructed. This is to ensure food deliveries and passenger pick-ups can be successfully carried out, the technology firm said. Grab is undertaking this initiative because the Tengah HDB estate is designated as a “car-lite” town with fewer parking spaces, and more walking and cycling connections. To that end, Grab is ensuring that amid the network of walking paths and newly opened roads, its delivery riders and ride-hailing drivers are able to navigate the area more proficiently. “Grab is using its proprietary mapping technology to update maps with Tengah’s evolving network of roads and points of interests, to ease residents’ concerns around the difficulties of navigating roads amidst ongoing construction and finding the right pick-up and drop-off points,” said Grab in a statement on Thursday. Adviser to Hong Kah North Grassroots Organisations Amy Khor, who attended the media event announcing this initiative, said Grab’s initiative will complement efforts by government agencies to improve transport connectivity at Tengah. “Residents will benefit from this initiative that can help make deliveries and ride-hailing bookings more timely,” said Dr Khor, who is also Senior Minister of State for Transport. To map out the area visually, Grab staff have been plodding around walking paths at Tengah weekly since March, carrying backpacks mounted with camera devices. The device — the KartaCam — has a camera on each of its four sides, creating a 360-degree view of every footpath and road in the vicinity. “The KartaCam backpack enables better mapping of footpaths through green spaces, and allows detailed surveys of corridors and entrances in Tengah,” said Grab. “This is especially beneficial for delivery partners who travel on foot or on bicycles, as they can now choose the most efficient path to their destinations.” The bag and camera weigh approximately 6kg, and with a stand supporting it, and the camera is about 2m above ground when worn by an adult. Grab will then use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse the images to map out the area, said head of product for maps at Grab Sunny Wijewardana. “We will get the images out of the camera, and then we will extract all the information out of it, and then code that into a map that is used for all our deliveries,” he said. For instance, traffic lights and road signs will be picked up by AI and such information will be added to the map data. The information will then be used to map out points of interest, including lift lobbies, to help food delivery riders complete their deliveries. “With a new area like this, our customers may have issues finding the right drop off point, or pick up point, they might have issues with getting the right delivery coming to their house as well,” said Mr Wijewardana. “So, we want to take the initiative and we want to be proactive and resolve any of these problems before they happen.” Grab is also mapping out the roads of Tengah on a weekly basis by mounting the KartaCam device on a car, to ensure that its ride-hailing drivers can better locate passengers. During a car ride through Tengah, CNA found that some roads within the towns that appear on other map applications were actually still under construction and not open to the public yet. “(Tengah) is rapidly changing. Every week, there is a new road being completed, there’s a new building, new U-turns being put in, and we want to be as accurate as possible for customers,” said Grab’s managing director Yee Wee Tang. “We want to make sure that when passengers book a car, it is matched to the exact location, or else there are a lot of disputes.” Both mapping initiatives are under GrabMaps, which collects location-based services and mapping data across Southeast Asia. It was launched by Grab in 2022. Since March, Grab fully mapped six precincts in Tengah, which comprise over 10km of roads and footpaths and nearly 160 points of interest such as lift lobbies, HDB blocks and a list of businesses in Tengah's new town. As of June, these six precincts are the first to be completed, out of 22 planned HDB precincts. “Grab will map new precincts in Tengah as HDB opens them for key collection, and continue to update the maps for the existing precincts as roads and points of interests develop,” it said. In addition to the mapping exercise, Grab will provide free delivery from over 2,000 F&B outlets and grocery stores to Tengah residents from June 14 until the end of the year. The firm said this is to ensure residents have access to a wider variety of food choices while malls and restaurants open up over time. At the event, Dr Khor said that some amenities at Tengah are set to open soon. Plantation Plaza, for example, the first neighbourhood centre in Tengah, has been completed and the supermarket and food court will be the first to open later this month. One Tengah resident said that he welcomes Grab's initiative to offer free deliveries but is taking a “wait and see” approach to whether connectivity in the area will improve. Real estate consultant Loh Zhenhao said that booking ride-hailing apps out of Tengah has been “difficult”, with wait times stretching to an hour before a driver accepts his ride, even when he books on a variety of platforms. He is holding his breath on whether the mapping initiative will improve things. “It’s hypothetical to say now, because I haven't experienced it,” said the 40-year-old. “I can only tell you once I experience it.” CNA CNA editor's note: This article has been amended to correct the number of planned HDB precincts in Tengah, after Grab amended the information it initially provided.

The Sky Pad bungee trampoline and FlowRider surf simulator are located at the stern of Royal Caribbean’s Spectrum of the Seas. Photos: Royal Caribbean Royal Caribbean’s multi-port options let you sail to Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia – offering a variety of rich experiences in one trip. With international borders open to tourists, travellers once again face a holidaymaker’s dilemma: Where to and where first? Malaysia beckons with its diverse culinary scene and pretty cafes. Thailand offers plenty of street food and incredible shopping. Vietnam remains known for its natural sights and bustling streets. Can’t quite decide which destination to visit? A cruise may be the answer to your quandary. Royal Caribbean’s multi-port cruises let travellers pop into cities like Ho Chi Minh and Bangkok while enjoying a raft of onboard amenities and activities enroute. What’s more, the all-inclusive cruises mean there are no unwelcome surprises with the bill. TIME WELL-SPENT For couples, Royal Caribbean’s new Spectrum of the Seas cruise has all you need for a romantic getaway. The largest cruise ship in Asia, it delivers a series of firsts. Onboard, RipCord by iFly is the first skydiving experience at sea, allowing you to enjoy the thrill and exhilaration of skydiving in a safe, controlled, simulated environment. Sky Pad offers a bungee trampoline adventure that uses virtual reality to transport you out of this world. For more, take in the ultimate sea views on the North Star – the world’s highest observation capsule on a cruise ship – and witness the majestic beauty of the ocean. Then wind down and relax at the adults-only Solarium, a sanctuary offering open views of the ocean, where you can relax in one of its pools and sip refreshing cocktails in the lounge area. If your new year resolutions include picking up a new hobby, the ship offers several fun-filled opportunities – whether you want a relaxing or thrilling vacation. Fashion jewellery with beads and stones or pick up scrapbooking skills to start that travel journal. Learn the basics of archery or enrol in salsa, hip hop, swing and ballroom dance lessons. Spur your relationship to new heights by clambering up the ship’s 12m rock wall, or catch waves on the FlowRider surf simulator. Complimentary dishes range from a rotating menu of gourmet courses in the Main Dining Room (so there’s always something new to eat) to the Windjammer (paninis, pastries, buttermilk fried chicken and Vietnamese braised pork included). For an intimate epicurean journey, the ship’s Chef de Cuisine serves up delicious scallop carpaccio and Maine lobsters – paired with wine, of course – at the exclusive Chef’s Table. If molecular gastronomy’s more your taste, Wonderland offers Insta-worthy creations like crispy crab cones topped with fluffy avocado mousse, or gazpacho served with pepper spheres and bread foam. For a taste of Asia, enjoy a spicy kick at Sichuan Red and comfort fare at The Hot Pot. THE MORE THE MERRIER Cruises are terrific fun because they have something for all ages and interests, while enabling you to spend quality time with loved ones. Everyone – from grandparents to grandchildren – will love the two-storey Ultimate Family Suite, which hosts up to 10 guests. The room comes with an in-suite slide, 3D cinema and karaoke setup, and balcony for chilling in the jacuzzi and dining outdoors. Multi-generational families travelling is a cinch on cruises – Grandma could take up sushi-making classes at Izumi while the kids post on TikTok at the Teen Lounge before everyone meets up again for meals. Will your group opt for a round of bumper cars or an augmented reality hunt with Expedition Two70? Even last-minute whims can be catered to, as anyone can reserve these activities on the Royal app. The ship is also home to an active entertainment scene. For instance, Virtual Concert offers high-resolution video footage of live performances captured by 4K cameras for an immersive experience. From live music and cocktails at Schooner Bar to dance anthems under the stars by the pool, variety is truly celebrated as the spice of life aboard the Spectrum of the Seas. Elaborate performances are a highlight on any cruise. Catch The Silk Road, a spectacular live show that sees the Two70 theatre’s panoramic windows transformed into a gigantic projection surface. Artistes perform against stunning backdrops, taking passengers on an adventure-fuelled trip into the past through Rome, Persia, India and China. Adults can also indulge in the pomp and grandeur of Showgirl, while the kids watch the lovable heroes of The Effectors battle arch-nemesis Crash and enjoy educational fun at the Adventure Science Lab. Little ones can get their science cap on with fun bubbly experiments at Aquanauts. Find made to order sushi, ramen and izakaya style starters at Izumi or tuck into Italian classics at Sorrento’s Pizza. For a front row seat to an entertaining culinary show, look no further than Teppanyaki. At Dog House, children can pick their favourite gourmet sausages and go wild with the wide variety of condiments, or quickly settle hunger pangs after playing in the waters at Splashaway Café. START THE YEAR WITH SAVINGS With the return of multiple-port-of-call travel, Royal Caribbean is ready to start the year with a bang. And what better way to welcome this year’s Chinese New Year celebrations than with a Royal Ang Bao sale? Families will want to catch the last call for Kids Cruise Free* in June.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Jason Marine Group’s partnership with NTUC LearningHub brings both company and employees to the next level. Gaining familiarity with cloud-based platforms and learning technology skills such as coding have enabled Mr Koek Cheng Kwee to boost his productivity at work. Photos: NTUC LearningHub Jason Marine Group’s partnership with NTUC LearningHub brings both company and employees to the next level. At 60, one might expect Mr Koek Cheng Kwee to slow down at work and look ahead to his retirement years. Instead, the training and sales consultancy manager at Jason Marine Group is busy helping to automate processes at his workplace with his newly acquired tech skills, courtesy of a UiPath course he took at NTUC LearningHub , a continuing education and training provider that champions workers’ lifelong employability. Jason Marine Group, a local small- and medium-size enterprise that specialises in marine communication equipment and services, believes in fostering a learning culture and encouraging employees to take ownership of their career paths. It chose to partner NTUC LearningHub because of the latter’s comprehensive range of learning solutions, ranging from consultancy work to industry-recognised curriculums and customised content development for training courses. “We believe in the power of knowledge,” said Mr Kevin Tan, talent acquisition and branding manager of Jason Marine Group. “The more employees know, the more they can do to make their lives better and contribute to the organisation. We believe that our employees are worth the investment.” A BOOST IN PRODUCTIVITY Mr Koek was a marine radio officer sailing with cargo ships for nine years before he came ashore for good and joined Jason Marine Group as a sales coordinator for the China market in 1996. Over the years, he has been promoted multiple times. In his current role, he advises the company’s clients on technical product issues. Throughout the many changes in his career, Mr Koek has always enjoyed attending training sessions to learn new skills. “I cherish the opportunities to continuously improve my knowledge base and keep abreast of updated technologies,” he said. Gaining familiarity with cloud-based platforms and learning technology skills such as coding have enabled him to boost his productivity at work, benefiting both the company and his career. One of the most fruitful courses he attended was UiPath training at NTUC LearningHub in October 2020. UiPath is a software platform that uses cloud computing to automate business processes. Mr Koek learnt to use UiPath to automate the extraction of information from a dynamic database in order to generate updated business reports. “UiPath enables us to work more efficiently by using automated processes to take care of repetitive tasks,” explained Mr Koek. “This frees up time for us to focus on other value-added tasks and helps to reduce errors when generating reports. It’s a win-win situation for us all.” TAKING OWNERSHIP OF LEARNING The three-week UiPath course meant that Mr Koek had to schedule urgent work matters around his learning hours, but his colleagues were ready to help cover his daily tasks during the training period. The supportive environment at Jason Marine Group has helped to strengthen team cohesion and staff bonding. The organisation also welcomes input from employees on company-related activities and policies, like learning and development. Mr Tan added that employees’ ownership of the learning process enables them to contextualise lessons according to business needs and improves learning takeaways. “With ample opportunities to learn, employees get a platform to showcase their talent at Jason Marine Group,” he said. “New job candidates know that there are growth opportunities, and this also leads to increased employee engagement and retention.” Since his UiPath training, Mr Koek shared that he has become more adaptable and agile when it comes to navigating other automation platforms and tools. He has also developed a curious mindset and a more systematic approach to problem-solving. For example, he built on the foundation of his learning by acquiring a deeper understanding of Python to further automate tasks at work. He was inspired to pick up the programming language on his own after his UiPath training, and soon put his newfound coding skills to good use. “I used Python to create an automation process for our satellite subscriptions section,” he recounted. “The process extracts satellite air-time data and reports to clients when a predefined usage threshold is reached. Not only were we able to reduce the time required to generate the reports, we also saw an increase in the accuracy of the reports.” SUPPORTING BUSINESS OBJECTIVES WITH CUSTOMISED LEARNING Jason Marine Group is looking to collaborate further with NTUC LearningHub to develop customised courses aimed at equipping employees with transferrable skills needed to succeed in a digitalised and sustainability-driven work environment. As reference, Mr Tan cited the 16 competencies of the new Critical Core Skills developed by SkillsFuture Singapore. These competencies fall into three skill clusters: Thinking critically, interacting with others and staying relevant. Acquiring these skills will be useful in transitioning successfully into new roles across sectors. Staying relevant is especially familiar to Mr Koek, who said that the UiPath course has enabled him to learn with agility and increase productivity at work. “I am looking forward to picking up new skills in domains like artificial intelligence and robotics,” said Mr Koek. “I hope what I have learned will enable me to do research and development for the company or solve some of the technical challenges we face.” As part of continuing growth, Jason Marine Group plans to have a suite of programmes with NTUC LearningHub that is aligned with the company’s strategies on service delivery. To get employees on board with a continuous learning culture in the workplace, Mr Tan advised: “Besides communicating the benefits of training, the management team must also help in employees’ learning journey by recognising their enhanced competencies in the appraisal process. This will ensure that employees embrace the learning and career development opportunities provided.” Learn more about how to develop your company’s talent with NTUC LearningHub .

Using insights drawn from its 2023 consumer trends report, Shopee plans to continue innovating its digital offerings to engage users and meet their lifestyle needs. Photos: Shopee The company’s latest survey revealed that shoppers here – both young and old – are turning to the digital platform’s services for their shopping and entertainment needs. Online shopping, in-app gaming and live streaming – these may be digital habits commonly associated with the young and tech-savvy, but on e-commerce platform Shopee , seniors are just as comfortable as their younger counterparts to shop, game and watch livestream content. According to Shopee’s Past the Starting Line: Adapting to Singapore’s Digital Consumers in 2023 report , 70 per cent of seniors aged 55 years and above say they have successfully integrated e-commerce into their lives. Thanks to the platform’s user-friendly interface and interactive features, 84 per cent of senior respondents are buying a larger variety of items online – particularly from the health and wellness, and home appliances categories – as compared to a year before. They’ve also become more adept at collecting and combining vouchers to stack savings. As more senior users embrace e-commerce, they’re also looking for other ways to stay entertained online. One in two among them enjoys playing in-app games such as Shopee Candy and Shopee Bubble , which offer discount vouchers as prizes. Now, who says the silver generation isn’t digitally savvy? KNOWING WHAT USERS WANT With e-commerce being such an integral part of our everyday lives, Shopee embarked on a poll last year to better understand Singapore consumers’ online shopping habits and attitudes. Over 1,300 users aged between 15 and 70 were surveyed, and 87 per cent of respondents shared that the convenience of online shopping has made a significant positive impact on their lives. Shoppers today are making more purchases online, with more than 70 per cent of respondents receiving up to five packages from e-commerce platforms per month. The survey results also revealed that today’s digital-first consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms that offer end-to-end online shopping experiences that include engagement and entertainment. They are more discerning of quality and are willing to spend time reviewing the authenticity of products and retailers before making a purchase. BUILDING A COMMUNITY OF TRUST Indeed, authenticity and trust are critical when it comes to online purchases. Shopee encourages users to read and leave product and retailer reviews to help others make informed purchasing decisions – an effort that has proven beneficial to shoppers. Three in four survey respondents have found customer reviews on Shopee reliable and believe that they help with their buying decisions. Additionally, the e-commerce giant has incorporated a slew of consumer protection measures to allow users to shop more confidently. For example, on Shopee Mall , users can buy the products they love directly from brands or authorised retailers’ official stores, ensuring their authenticity. Its Shopee Guarantee safety feature withholds payment to sellers until buyers have received their items in good condition and acknowledged that they are satisfied with their purchases. Shopee was the first among e-commerce platforms in Singapore to launch this safeguard for consumers. Shopee has also streamlined the reporting process at Shopee Help Centre , so that users who have concerns about their products can make a report conveniently. To help users learn about the products they’re interested in through a more authentic and intimate setting, Shopee introduced Shopee Live in 2019 – a livestream function that showcases real-time reviews and recommendations. According to Shopee, these live shows – which include a variety of content from food reviews to product demonstrations – have become increasingly popular among viewers aged 34 to 50. More importantly, they have become a credible resource for buyers: Over 60 per cent of survey respondents aged 35 and above say that such real-time reviews and recommendations from hosts during the livestream on Shopee Live are key to influencing their purchase decisions on Shopee. Building trust with consumers has always been an imperative for Shopee. With over 75 per cent of users in Singapore now choosing to search, compare and eventually buy a product on the platform, it is a testament to how much the brand has connected with users over the years. Said Mr Zhou Junjie, chief commercial officer at Shopee: “As digital consumers continue to shape the future of the digital economy, it is important to be able to identify their evolving needs and preferences while adapting quickly to meet them. We will continue to adopt a user-centric approach using these insights to create a positive experience for all Shopee users.” Learn more about Shopee’s Past the Starting Line: Adapting to Singapore’s Digital Consumers in 2023 report .

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight As more small businesses take to selling on entertainment platforms like TikTok, logistics provider J&T Express stands ready to deliver. With hectic sales campaign periods on content platforms such as TikTok Shop, support from trustworthy logistics providers like J&T Express is vital. Photo: J&T Express As more small businesses take to selling on entertainment platforms like TikTok, logistics provider J&T Express stands ready to deliver. When it comes to electronic goods, TikTok creator Melissa Wix knows her stuff. As the person behind The Auction House SG, The Heist SG and local start-up Aurion Gadgets, it’s perhaps not surprising that she emerged as the No 1 livestream seller during TikTok Shop’s 12.12 Live Ranking Competition in 2022. Ms Wix has been selling on the content platform for six years, but even a veteran like her has encountered a hiccup or two. “The most challenging livestream I experienced recently was co-hosting with Wang Lei,” she shared, speaking of her collaboration with the local getai singer who made a new name for himself selling frozen seafood online. “We had a language barrier as my Mandarin is poor and his English is shaky. However, this worked out to our advantage because everyone found it funny. We are two opposite livestreamers in terms of age, language, viewers and products, but it worked out great, surprisingly.” No doubt, the spontaneity of livestreaming on TikTok Shop is one of the draws for Ms Wix. “I hope to be doing this for as long as I can,” she said. “I enjoy livestreaming. It doesn’t feel like a job at all.” THE RIGHT TOOLS FOR THE RIGHT NEEDS “Shoppertainment” – blending entertainment with online shopping – has proven to be an effective strategy for driving sales online. Consumer engagement is key, and nothing seems to foster engagement better than social media. The move to selling directly on these platforms has been both organic and lucrative – Forbes magazine last year estimated social commerce to be worth US$1.2 trillion (S$1.6 trillion) globally. TikTok is one of the latest to harness the power of that wave, with the launch of its retail arm – TikTok Shop – last year. AFTERSHOCK PC, a custom personal computer builder, was quick among Singapore businesses to grab the opportunity. “The best part about selling on TikTok Shop is how it is integrated with the in-feed content, subtly and unassumingly appearing on audiences’ For You page,” said Mr Jonathan Teo, AFTERSHOCK PC’s marketing lead. TikTok Shop’s Affiliate Program also enables e-commerce businesses to sell another company’s products and offers support and training to creators. “My account manager and creator manager go to great lengths to help me,” said Ms Wix. “Due to my hectic schedule, I once could not make it to a certain location for my livestream. My account manager brought the products to me instead, so we could carry out the livestream without hiccups.” Above all, AFTERSHOCK PC and Ms Wix prize the ability to interact directly with their customers. “We feel more connected to our audiences when we do livestreams,” said Mr Teo. “In the past, we could only address our customers’ concerns when we met them in person. Livestreaming bridges that barrier, allowing us to interact and engage with them virtually ‘in person’.” A PARTNER THAT BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER To drive transactions, TikTok Shop regularly organises campaigns, such as 11.11, 12.12 and the Prosperity Sale for Chinese New Year. “These always bring us outstanding results,” said Mr Teo. “For 11.11, we acquired around 300 new followers just from the livestream.” Ms Wix agreed: “We’ve broken a few sales records on TikTok Shop Singapore. Our 12.12 livestream hit six digits in a single four-hour stream.” With hectic sales campaign periods, support from trustworthy logistics providers is especially crucial. Ms Wix uses J&T Express, citing its speed and reliability. “J&T Express’ tracking feature is very accurate, and I’m amazed at how fast it can deliver, usually one to three days upon collection,” she said. “During sales campaigns, J&T Express also gave customers vouchers and held giveaways, which made products across TikTok Shop more attractive.” J&T Express is well aware of the logistical challenges TikTok Shop sellers face – such as having lean teams, live selling at odd hours, and packaging orders. Said Mr Peter Cai, J&T Express Singapore’s chief executive officer: “For example, writing details on the airway bills may be easy for a few orders, but what about a thousand orders? In e-commerce, sellers must be prepared to scale with a full-fledged logistics partner.” Mr Cai added that J&T Express educates and advises sellers so that they can enjoy linear growth without being hindered by logistical problems and focus on building their e-commerce empire. “We see ourselves as the integrated logistics partner of TikTok Shop Singapore and other social media commerce platforms,” he said. Join TikTok Shop’s Treat Yourself Sale Campaign from Feb 25 to 27, 2023, for a seamless shoppertainment experience.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Regulating stress levels and using skin-friendly products can help bring relief to eczema-prone skin, say experts. According to Dr Tay Liang Kiat, a dermatologist at Stratum Skin and Surgery, itch is the most debilitating symptom for most eczema patients and could adversely affect one's sleep quality. Photos: Shutterstock Regulating stress levels and using skin-friendly products can help bring relief to eczema-prone skin, say experts. Eczema, a chronic condition that causes dry, itchy and inflamed skin , afflicts more individuals than we think. According to local statistics , one in five children and one in 10 adults have eczema. So, what causes eczema to flare up? Dr Tay Liang Kiat, a dermatologist at Stratum Skin and Surgery, observed that stress is a crucial and common trigger. “The uptick in stress hormones causes increased skin inflammation and reduces the ability of skin to repair itself,” he said. He added that temperature extremes, perspiration and airborne allergens (like dust mites, pollen and pet fur) could exacerbate the condition. Practices adopted post COVID-19 could play a part, too. Frequent handwashing and the increased use of hand sanitisers and disinfecting sprays or wipes may contribute to eczema flare-ups. EASING THE ITCH Dr Tay noted that itch is the most debilitating symptom for most eczema patients. “Besides causing poor sleep, intense itch also affects performance at work and in school, reducing one’s quality of life.” There are several medical treatments available for eczema, said Dr Shanna Ng, dermatologist, The Dermatology Practice @ Orchard. Topical steroids and topical non-steroids can help to reduce symptoms like inflammation and swelling while oral antihistamines may alleviate itching. Immunosuppressants and immunomodulating treatments may also be prescribed to inhibit the body’s immune response to allergens like dust or pet fur. However, relying on oral antihistamines and topical steroids may not suit all eczema patients. “Improper understanding and use of medication may cause side effects in the long run,” said Ms Jianny Tan, a pharmacist in the product development and marketing department at Orendapharma. She cites how improper use of topical steroids may lead to reactions such as skin atrophy , easy bruising , and in serious cases, topical steroid withdrawal resulting in burning, reddened skin and other symptoms . Ms Tan added that not all eczema-related skin conditions can be treated with antihistamines: “Sedating antihistamines may help to induce sleep, but they don’t stop eczema flares and may not be effective in treating eczema-related itch.” According to Ms Tan, Orendapharma’s team of researchers gathered in-depth feedback from dermatologists, who surfaced the difficulty of sourcing an effective, convenient and safe product that eczema sufferers could use on a daily basis for itch relief, especially in hard-to-reach areas such as the scalp, back and legs. “That’s why we created the AweMed Spray, the first product in the AweMed series, to serve as a temporary reliever for acute itch with its ‘cooling’ effect,” said Ms Tan. The AweMed team managed to stabilise natural menthol, which targets the body’s cooling receptor , in a liquid formulation without alcohol and harsh solvents, thus creating a product that would target itch while being gentle on skin. Ms Tan said the spray format makes it easy and convenient to apply. Its cooling formulation is also a boon for eczema patients living in tropical Singapore, where a combination of heat and humidity can adversely affect the skin, she added. As menthol has a strong cooling sensation, Ms Tan recommends first-time users to spray the AweMed Spray onto their palms and use their fingers to dab the product onto affected areas in order to establish their level of comfort, before spraying it on directly. A SALVE FOR DAMAGED SKIN With eczema, the skin barrier is damaged, causing the skin to lose moisture and become inflamed, allowing allergens to enter . “Secondary bacterial infection often results in ‘weepy’ eczema skin rashes,” said Dr Tay. To protect and repair the skin barrier, Dr Ng advises that patients increase their moisturiser use as soon as eczema itch sets in. She recommends moisturisers with clean formulations that are free of fragrance, sulphates and parabens. “Moisturising adequately and frequently throughout the day, even when there are no flare-ups, is of utmost importance,” she said. According to Ms Tan, the AweMed Repair+ Daily Moisturiser is a therapeutic moisturiser that tackles the three main symptoms of eczema – damaged skin, itchy inflammation and bacterial infection risk. She explained that the moisturising formula replenishes both the intercellular and cellular barriers of the skin, reduces inflammation and uses the natural compound zinc pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA) to reduce secondary bacterial infections. “AweMed Repair+ is free from harsh ingredients such as steroids, ethanol, fragrances and parabens, so it doesn’t irritate the already weakened skin barrier,” said Ms Tan. “Users are recommended to apply it liberally to their skin two to three times daily or when necessary, to reduce the recurrence of acute or chronic eczema flare-ups.” Beyond medical treatment and therapeutic products, Dr Tay underscored the importance of stress management in treating eczema and preventing flare-ups. He said: “Engage in activities that promote relaxation, such as social interactions with family and friends. Eating a healthy balanced diet, getting sufficient rest and sleep as well as exercising regularly could help.” For eczema patients, the right combination of products, lifestyle adjustments and doctor-prescribed treatments could mean sweet relief from the itch. After all, there’s no time like now to lead your best life. Said Dr Ng: “Don’t wait till you’re eczema-free to do the things you love.” AweMed Repair+ Daily Moisturiser and the AweMed Spray can be purchased online on the AweMed website , Lazada , Shopee , and at selected hospitals and clinics. Follow AweMed Series on Instagram or Facebook for video tips on how to deal with eczema.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Financial independence and early retirement are popular goals for millennials and Gen Z workers – but getting there requires steady financial habits, not risky investments. Advocates of the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) believe that frugal living, aggressive saving and savvy investing can make early retirement a reality, rather than a pipe dream. Photo: Unsplash Financial independence and early retirement are popular goals for millennials and Gen Z workers – but getting there requires steady financial habits, not risky investments. Gen Zs and millennials may be the two youngest age groups currently in employment – but according to the OCBC Financial Index 2022 , they are the ones who want to retire earlier than everyone else. While workers aged between 40 and 54, as well as between 55 and 65, preferred to retire at 61 and 65 years of age, respectively, millennials (aged 30 to 39) wanted to stop working at the age of 58, while Gen Z (aged 21 to 29) stated that 57 was their desired retirement age. A growing movement among millennials and Gen Z workers is the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). This involves achieving financial independence and retiring much earlier than the official retirement age , through a combination of frugal living, aggressive saving and savvy investing. FIRE adherents may aim to retire by their 40s, or even earlier . With employee burnout being the leading factor affecting mental health in Singapore during the pandemic, it’s no surprise that more people are thinking about leaving behind the daily hustle in favour of a slower-paced early retirement. OBSTACLES TO CREATING FIRE The desire to retire early has been made more complicated by a range of environmental factors, such as an unbalanced post-pandemic recovery, high interest rates, inflation and market volatility. These have caused Singaporeans’ financial wellness to decline, dipping one point from last year to match 2020’s score of 61 out of a maximum of 100. The index tracks each respondent’s replies to 24 indicators across 10 pillars of financial wellness, including their saving habits and retirement planning. The Index also found that young Singaporeans were still keen on pursuing risky investments, such as cryptocurrencies, despite many experiencing losses in 2022’s crypto crash. This could be due to a lack of investment education or – as suggested by one local pundit – the hope that cryptocurrency investments could make achieving FIRE possible. Ms Tan Siew Lee, OCBC Bank’s head of wealth management, said that 2022’s market downturn has naturally made young people in Singapore concerned about their finances and their ability to save for retirement. “However, engaging in high-risk, speculative behaviour in the hope of making quick gains might cause one’s retirement dream to drift even further out of reach,” she said. RISKY BUSINESS According to the OCBC Financial Wellness Index, two in five crypto investors in their 20s planned to invest more in cryptocurrencies within the next 12 months, despite making average losses of 40 per cent from crypto investments in 2022. This stronger appetite for risk could be due to the younger generations’ own uncertainty regarding whether their goal of early retirement can be reached, as 62 per cent of Gen Zs and 56 per cent of millennials expressed worry that their retirement funds will prove inadequate for their desired lifestyle. Gen Z was also eyeing a more luxurious retirement, with 34 per cent – the highest proportion compared to other age groups – aiming for a retirement lifestyle that includes private healthcare, full-time domestic help and international holidays twice yearly. In FIRE terms, this is known as Fat FIRE – in which one enjoys an early retirement without having to cut back on life’s luxuries . Fattening up one’s investment portfolio for Fat FIRE is a challenge, though. Overall, the market downturn in 2022 affected Gen Z the most, with 42 per cent seeing a loss in their investment portfolios, followed by 35 per cent for millennials. These figures were up 19 per cent and 10 per cent respectively, compared to last year. Compared to the other age groups, Gen Z also saw the lowest rate of return on their investments at 0.3 per cent. But it’s not all doom: About 48 per cent of Gen Z were deriving side income from part-time endeavours, ranging from food delivery to running online businesses or giving tuition. Having a secondary stream of income can raise one’s monthly earnings substantially . In addition, you can always carry on with your side hustle after quitting your day job – a form of FIRE known as Barista FIRE, where part-time or freelance work supplements income and helps workers keep one foot in the world of employment , should they need to return full-time. FINANCING THE FUTURE While the post-pandemic phase of economic recovery has seen more revenge travel and consumer spending, Singaporeans remained strong savers, with 91 per cent saving at least 10 per cent of their salary. Less went to contingency and retirement funds, two categories that saw a slight dip in savings allocation. Only 53 per cent of Singaporeans had the recommended six months’ worth of their current salary in their savings to overcome a crisis. Sixty-eight per cent of Singaporeans had made a retirement plan – a two per cent increase from 2021. Gen Z workers might need to work on that plan a little more, though: Their preferred retirement lifestyle – with vacations to Europe and the United States, and a high-end car – is likely to cost around S$5,760 a month, instead of most Singaporeans’ estimate of S$3,617. And with investment portfolios hard hit in 2022 – especially if they held risky assets, like crypto – only 42 per cent of Singaporeans were on track to achieving their retirement goals, compared to 49 per cent in 2021. Nevertheless, with the right financial habits, Gen Z and millennials can get their FIRE dreams back on track. Said Ms Tan: “When growing one’s retirement funds, it’s best to think long-term, seek professional advice and do research before investing. Young Singaporeans are generally good savers and with prudent financial habits, they can weather this storm – and eventually, achieve their financial goals and ideal retirement.” Visit the OCBC Financial Wellness Index to learn more about Singaporeans’ financial wellness, how you compare and what you can do to improve your own financial health.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Being able to handle stress well, whether in school or at work, starts with having the right nutrition. Here’s how the new Meiji Multivitamin Milk can help supplement your diet. Drinking milk is an easy way to get a variety of nutrients into your diet. Photos: CP-Meiji Singapore Being able to handle stress well, whether in school or at work, starts with having the right nutrition. Here’s how the new Meiji Multivitamin Milk can help supplement your diet. When it comes to eating well, most of us start out with the best intentions. We find nutritious recipes, pick up colourful produce at the supermarket, and set aside time to prepare healthy meals for ourselves and our children. However, when the pressures of work and school kick in, it’s all too easy to let good eating habits fall by the wayside in favour of heavily processed, ready-to-eat food. Ever craved bubble tea or reached for potato chips when you’re studying for an important exam or rushing to meet a deadline? Eating junk food – usually food that's high in fat and sugar – causes our brain to release dopamine , a neurotransmitter that makes us feel good, providing temporary release from stress. Over the long term, consuming too much fatty or sugary foods can increase inflammation in the body, exacerbating stress and anxiety while putting you at risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes. A healthy diet – one that includes complex carbohydrates, protein, healthy fats, and a variety of vitamins and minerals – is an important part of stress management as it helps regulate hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. The good news: Eating healthy doesn’t have to be time-consuming or daunting. With some small tweaks and by making informed choices, it’s possible to fit good nutrition into your busy schedule. WHY IS MILK GOOD FOR US? Drinking milk, long touted as being beneficial for our health, is an easy way to get a variety of nutrients into your diet. Milk is good for us as it’s a complete protein, according to a report by accredited nutritionist and presenter-host Charlotte Mei de Drouas, who runs nutrition literacy workshops and talks. “In addition to casein and whey, milk contains all nine essential amino acids that cannot be synthesised by the body, and therefore have to be obtained through one’s diet,” said Ms de Drouas. Milk also supplies one with energy, along with micronutrients in an easily absorbed form, she added. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are vital for our bodies to function well, and while they are needed only in small quantities, any deficiency may lead to health issues. PLUGGING NUTRITION GAPS WITH ENRICHED MILK A study published in Public Health Nutrition in 2017 found that fortified milk reduced the risk of anaemia in young children, although more evidence is needed before global recommendations can be made, clarified Ms de Drouas. Another study published in the journal Nutrients in 2017 revealed that students who consumed fortified milk were found to have higher academic performance, motivation and learning compared to those who did not. “When consumed alongside a balanced diet of wholegrains, protein, fruit and vegetables, Meiji Multivitamin Milk, which is enriched with 17 multivitamins and minerals, can complement one’s meals and help adults meet their recommended daily allowance for various nutrients,” said Ms de Drouas. Those who bemoan their inability to digest dairy have another reason to cheer: Meiji Multivitamin Milk is lactose-free. It is also low in saturated fat and contains no added sugar. WHAT MAKES MEIJI MULTIVITAMIN MILK DIFFERENT? Vitamins found in Meiji Multivitamin Milk can be classified into two categories: Fat- and water-soluble vitamins, said Ms de Drouas. Meiji Multivitamin Milk contains Vitamin B-Complex, which includes B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9 and B12. “These help convert protein, carbohydrates and fat into energy for the body,” she explained, adding that these water-soluble vitamins are essential for growth and development, as well as the optimal functioning of cells. Vitamin B-Complex is also important for energy production and nervous system function, both of which can be affected by stress. Vitamin B6, in particular, is known to help regulate mood and reduce anxiety. Vitamins A, D, E and K are some of the fat-soluble vitamins found in Meiji Multivitamin Milk. Vitamin A is essential in maintaining good eye health and a robust immune system. Vitamin D helps with the absorption of calcium required to build and maintain strong and healthy bones, while Vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cells from damage. Vitamin K is required for blood clotting to help wounds heal. Meiji Multivitamin Milk also contains a range of minerals such as calcium, selenium, zinc, iron, sodium and phosphorous, which the body requires to function well, from building healthy bones to regulating hormone production. A WORD ON MIXING MILK AND VITAMINS Can there be too much of a good thing? According to Ms de Drouas, there is no evidence to show that mixing vitamins with milk is harmful, or that it compromises how nutrients are absorbed. But if you’re already taking vitamin or mineral supplements, seek the opinion of a health professional. When life gets hectic, meeting your nutritional requirements is important to help you learn, work and function well. By making smart food choices the next time you stock up on groceries, you can feel good about what you and your family eat even in the busiest of times.

The pastel-hued Coach Play Singapore Shophouse is inspired by the vibrant spirit of New York.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Acquiring in-demand tech skills at NTUC LearningHub gave three go-getters the confidence and competency to take on new challenges. The Community and Partnerships Specialist course at NTUC LearningHub allowed Ms Mariska Tan to learn more about digital marketing, event management and the Privacy Data Protection Act. Photos: NTUC LearningHub Acquiring in-demand tech skills at NTUC LearningHub gave three go-getters the confidence and competency to take on new challenges. With the nature of work and job roles constantly evolving with digital transformation, it is becoming more crucial than ever for jobseekers to possess an arsenal of skill sets that distinguishes them from other candidates. Ms Mariska Tan, who is in her 40s, was well aware of this when she interviewed for a procurement and sustainability specialist role at an event management company. Finding herself at a career crossroads, she gamely picked up new skills from the Community and Partnerships Specialist course at NTUC LearningHub , a continuing education and training centre for the infocomm technology (ICT) sector appointed by SkillsFuture Singapore . Designed to help people upskill or reskill to take on jobs with better prospects, the centre offers a range of courses focused on ICT skills in the areas of data analytics, software development, Agile and project management, cloud and infocomm technology infrastructure, and cybersecurity across all competency levels. Ms Tan also sent a handwritten card to her interviewers to thank them for their time – a tip she picked up from the Career Resilience Executive Workshop by NTUC’s e2i (Employment and Employability Institute). The sincere gesture, which demonstrated her soft skills in addition to her technical skills, helped her to secure the job. Along with fellow jobseekers Matlapudi Lakshmi Tulasi and Stanley Lee who also honed their digital skill sets at NTUC LearningHub, Ms Tan was able to embark on a new career. SAME ROLE, BUT NEW SKILLS FOR A NEW INDUSTRY Prior to joining her current company, Ms Tan spent over a decade as a procurement specialist at a chemical and mining services company. Uncertainty over job security (there were rumours of her team being outsourced), coupled with her need for down time after caring for critically ill family members, led Ms Tan to resign in December 2021. Initially, Ms Tan was eyeing the Digital Marketing Specialist course at NTUC LearningHub, but the timing did not suit her schedule. That turned out to be a blessing in disguise as her second choice, the six-month Community and Partnerships Specialist course, covered digital marketing, the fundamentals of event management and the Privacy Data Protection Act (PDPA) – all of which have come in handy in her present role. “Though I do not plan or organise events myself, I gained an understanding of what is involved in organising an event, which is useful when procuring goods and services for an events management company,” she said. “I also learnt how digital marketing can help with performance and reaching a wider audience, while the PDPA course taught me about data governance and protection, which is crucial as I evaluate vendors’ security and sustainability risks.” Her advice to others who are looking to upskill in new areas? “It’s never too late to learn something new, especially skills that are transferable across job roles,” she said. “You just have to put your heart into it and stay positive.” FROM STAY-AT-HOME MUM TO SOFTWARE ENGINEER After delivering her son in 2007, Ms Tulasi decided to put her career on hold to recover her health and care for her child. Now 42, she made the momentous decision to restart her career in 2018. On the advice of Workforce Singapore, she enrolled in NTUC LearningHub’s Java Developer course in 2020 to include an accredited certification in programming to her portfolio. The course equipped her with knowledge on Oracle and Spring Boot development frameworks, and honed her analytical and problem-solving skills. Ms Tulasi chose the course as it built on the learning she pursued during her hiatus from the workforce. She had taken a web development course and engaged in her own self-learning to ensure that she was better prepared to re-enter the tech industry at the appropriate juncture. In addition to the technical skills she picked up from the Java Developer course, she acquired critical core skills (soft skills) such as teamwork, time management and communication, which have proved useful in her current role as a software engineer in testing and production support. She secured the role in 2021 after completing the course and excelling at an internship at the same company that year. “The skills that I gained helped me land the job. I’m now working on the Java application and I help users fix issues they may face at work,” said Ms Tulasi. “I am able to tap on my technical, problem-solving and analytical skills to resolve their issues. My communication skills allow me to better understand from clients what the issues are, gather the requirements and meet their needs in a timely manner.” Ms Tulasi, who is looking forward to learning about different software applications, said that it is important to keep pace with change by being technologically savvy. Noting that the past decade has seen the rise of new technologies and new ways of working, she added: “To remain competitive, we must keep finding opportunities to upgrade ourselves. The course has given me an awareness of these changes in the industry and helped me to adapt to them.” AFTER RETRENCHMENT, A NEW PHASE Mr Lee was a systems engineering manager for a start-up when he was retrenched in March 2020. Methodical by nature, Mr Lee immediately examined his finances to ensure he had enough set aside for his daughter’s university education. He then updated his resume and kept a spreadsheet of all the hundreds of job applications he sent out. But it was the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and many organisations were cautious about hiring. Three to four months of unemployment went by. Unfazed, Mr Lee decided to sign up for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics course at NTUC LearningHub, fuelled by a childhood passion for robotics and programming. While he left midway through the nine-month-long course after securing a job as a principal engineer for a local infosecurity organisation in late 2020, he said that the programming and decision tree modules from the course are still relevant and applicable in his current role in cybersecurity. He also found the course instructors – who all had vast industry experience – patient and knowledgeable, while his course mates made learning fun, engaging and mutually beneficial: “We were able to share our experience and industrial know-how with our trainers and fellow course mates, and we helped one another in solving key issues related to programming and building robotics models.” Now a senior systems engineer for a data protection and data platform company, Mr Lee said that the AI and robotics course gave him a much-needed confidence boost, reassuring him it was still possible to learn even in his 50s. “The course certainly heeded the Government’s call to refresh, upskill, learn new skills and be a lifelong learner,” he reflected. “It expanded my knowledge and skill set, refreshing and enhancing my competencies.” “Some roles may utilise your newly acquired skills, while other skills learnt may have indirect applications, too,” he added. “As long as you have the commitment and determination, you can demonstrate and apply your new knowledge and skills.” Take the first step in upskilling yourself at NTUC LearningHub .

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight VitaHealth’s VLife series contains essential nutrients aimed at boosting energy levels and immunity, and reducing stress levels. Calm your mind, boost immunity and overcome the post-lunch slump with VitaHealth’s new VLife series, formulated for busy individuals on the go. Photos: VitaHealth, Shutterstock VitaHealth’s VLife series contains essential nutrients aimed at boosting energy levels and immunity, and reducing stress levels. Maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise and sufficient sleep are habits that are vital to our health and well-being, particularly with the demands of our fast-paced lives. For busy folks who struggle to find the time to eat well, a ready-to-drink dietary supplement could offer a convenient nutrition boost. The newly launched VLife series by VitaHealth , a health supplement brand with more than 76 years of experience in nutritional health, aims to do just that. Suitable for individuals aged 18 and above, the series comprises three formulations – B-Calm, Imunee and Powerr – all packaged in liquid sachets. Said Ms Beh Kheng Suan, VitaHealth’s country head in Malaysia and Singapore: “Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be challenging, especially when you’re constantly on the go. The VLife series is designed for busy individuals seeking a quick and easy way to nourish their body and support overall health and wellness.” A DOSE OF CALMNESS According to a study conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies , young adults in their 20s and middle-aged individuals in their 40s have experienced a decline in mental health over the course of the pandemic. Even as life gradually returns to a state of normalcy, persistent stressors such as the rising costs of living and ongoing uncertainty about the future continue to contribute to feelings of anxiety and distress. The adverse effects of prolonged stress on our health and well-being are widely acknowledged. VLife B-Calm is a wellness product that is designed to help relax one’s physiological and emotional state, with targeted benefits that include alleviating anxiety, enhancing focus, stabilising mood swings and reducing stress levels. “Formulated using a patented banana peel extract, VLife B-Calm aims to support serotonin levels in the brain,” said Ms Beh. Serotonin, often dubbed the “happy hormone”, plays a key role in boosting mood, managing stress and improving sleep quality. VLife B-Calm also contains L-theanine (green tea extract), chamomile extract and gamma-aminobutyric acid (bran ferment). L-theanine, an amino acid found in green tea, may relieve anxiety and improve mood, attention and memory, according to a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food . Meanwhile, chamomile , which is rich in the antioxidant apigenin, is recognised for its sedative properties, suggests a study published in the Journal of Education and Health Promotion . Gamma-aminobutyric acid has also been found to enhance sleep quality, as seen in research published in the Journal of Clinical Neurology . Those with pre-existing liver conditions may wish to consult their doctors before taking B-Calm due to the green tea extract in its formula. SUPPORTING YOUR IMMUNITY To boost the body’s natural defence and respiratory functions, Ms Beh recommends VLife Imunee , which contains elderberry ferment extract, Japanese honeysuckle (jin yin hua) as well as extracts of sea buckthorn (sha ji) and monk fruit (luo han guo). According to a study in the journal Food Chemistry: X , elderberries contain beneficial compounds such as polyphenols and anthocyanin that are known for their antioxidant properties. The patented elderberry ferment extract in Imunee contains these compounds and helps activate a healthy immune response by increasing cytokine production. Cytokines are proteins that aid in controlling inflammation in the body. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), ingredients such as Japanese honeysuckle , sea buckthorn and monk fruit are often used to support healthy upper respiratory functions, said Ms Beh. She added: “ Sea buckthorn is a common remedy in TCM to relieve phlegm and coughs, while monk fruit is traditionally used to nourish the lungs and throat.” A NATURAL ENERGY BOOST Whether you’re a student, working professional or busy parent, having sufficient energy to tackle daily tasks is crucial. VLife Powerr is designed to alleviate fatigue and promote sustained energy, leaving you mentally and physically rejuvenated. It incorporates a patented ginseng cordyceps complex ferment, along with four other stamina-boosting ingredients: Taurine to increase physical endurance, damiana leaf extract to improve blood circulation as well as Vitamin B complex and zinc to support metabolism. “VitaHealth’s patented ginseng cordyceps complex is produced using a three-stage fermentation process that increases its saponin content (one of the active ingredients in ginseng) by more than 600 per cent,” shared Ms Beh. Ginseng has long been associated with numerous health benefits, including improved memory function and blood circulation. Studies also suggest that it can help ease fatigue and increase energy levels. YOUR WELLNESS COMPANION The VLife series is conveniently available in a liquid sachet format, allowing for easy consumption at any time and place. Users may take it once or twice daily after meals. While capsule and tablet supplements remain the go-to among consumers, liquid supplements in ready-to-drink formats have become increasingly popular since the onset of the pandemic, according to market research from Euromonitor International . Ms Beh highlighted that the individual packaging of the VLife series not only offers convenience but also improves hygiene. She added that the VLife series uses a patented DoubleNutri liposomal technology that allows for better nutrient absorption, particularly for those with a sensitive digestive system. This micro-emulsification technology combines water- and oil-soluble nutrients with natural plant extracts and functional ingredients to form ultra-fine particles. This increases the bioavailability – the extent in which a substance can be absorbed and used by the body – by more than two times, according to Ms Beh. “In essence, this technology helps to enhance nutrient absorption, so that our body is able to function optimally”, she explained.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight London Weight Management offers a holistic shaping solution comprising tailored treatments, customised meal plans and specially formulated nutritional products. Celebrity mum Candyce Toh is heartened by how she has sized down from a large to a small since working with London Weight Management. Photos: London Weight Management London Weight Management offers a holistic shaping solution comprising tailored treatments, customised meal plans and specially formulated nutritional products. Postpartum weight gain is often a source of stress for new mothers. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine , changes in clothing size, hip width and breast shape are common during pregnancy. However, shedding those extra pounds is possible, said Ms Nicole Teo, a slimming supervisor at London Weight Management, especially within the first six months post-delivery. During this “golden window”, a mother's accumulated body fat is still in a “free state” and her endocrine system, metabolism, blood and lymphatic circulation are all “functioning at high gear”, making it an opportune time to pursue weight loss goals, she explained. Ms Teo also noted that the societal pressure for new mothers to bounce back to their pre-pregnancy weight can be overwhelming, leading to undue stress and anxiety. She advises women to prioritise their health and wellness needs and not to cut back on consuming nutritious food during confinement for fear of weight gain. “It is more important to nurse your body back to health post-delivery. If you are unsure about losing weight without compromising on your health, you can consider working with slimming experts to review and reach your body goals.” ENHANCING SHAPING OUTCOMES With over two decades of experience in the field, London Weight Management has been helping women with their weight loss goals since 2000. The brand has also served a roster of celebrity clients, including Michelle Chong, Naomi Neo and, most recently, Candyce Toh – who turned to its professional slimming and toning solutions after welcoming her second child last year. The brand’s signature offering is the multi-step ezSlim treatment that can be customised to focus on the client’s problem areas. At the beginning of each session, the client is assigned a personal consultant who will conduct a thorough body fat analysis test. The computerised analysis yields detailed information on body composition, including fat, water and muscle percentages. This helps the consultant better understand the client’s constitution and identify potential issues that could hamper slimming objectives. “During my first review, I learnt that conditions like water retention, a high body fat percentage and a sluggish lymphatic system could have hindered my attempts at shedding post-pregnancy pounds, as opposed to confinement-related overeating as I’d previously thought,” said Candyce. Following the review, the consultant draws up an ezSlim programme that best suits the client’s needs. In Candyce’s case, this began with the BioDetox Slimming Treatment, which activates the lymphatic system to clear toxins and lymphatic blockage while boosting blood circulation. She was then prescribed the ezSlim Body Contouring Treatment – a non-invasive 30-minute treatment that requires no downtime. “Unlike one-size-fits-all treatments, this regime is a tailored service that includes customised ampoules to address a range of body concerns,” said Ms Teo. The ampoules comprise formulations such as ezCleanse that targets bloating and water retention, ezBoost that addresses stubborn fat and ezFirm for body firming and contouring. The treatment starts with the Bio-Delivery System that optimises ampoule absorption with the aid of a handheld device to boost benefits. Thereafter, the Bio-Boost and Bio-3DS treatment steps work in tandem to deliver body sculpting and contouring results. Candyce is heartened by the results she has observed and the compliments she has received since starting treatment. “In three months, I had sized down from a large to a small, and could fit into my pre-pregnancy clothing,” she shared. WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR ALL Candyce and other mothers struggling with post-natal weight loss aren’t the only ones who have benefitted from the ezSlim approach. The programme also has a fan in multi-hyphenate media professional Michelle Chong. “Over the course of three months in 2022, I shed the weight I had put on during the pandemic,” she said. In addition to salon-based slimming solutions, Ms Teo recommends a holistic approach to weight management. These include customised meal plans and fuss-free nutritional products offered by the slimming chain. “We have a team of trained nutrition specialists who can provide practical advice on dietary habits to complement clients’ treatment goals,” she said. London Weight Management offers a range of beverages that supports one’s metabolic and digestive functions, such as Express Coffee, Express Matcha Tea and Berries Lite Detox Drink. The Formulated Dietary Food Roasted Grains is also available as a meal replacement option to regulate one’s appetite by moderating blood glucose levels. Candyce appreciates how the brand’s multi-pronged approach has supported her body goals. “My slimming journey has been seamless and doesn’t compromise my lifestyle choices,” she said. Give your confidence a boost with London Weight Management’s ezSlim Body Contouring Treatment , priced at S$28 nett for the first session. Individual results may vary.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Delivery work is hectic, intense and often goes unnoticed. But these Shopee employees aren’t afraid to go the distance to ensure packages are dispatched in a timely fashion. Shopee's logistics team takes pride in delivering quality service to customers. Photos: Shopee Delivery work is hectic, intense and often goes unnoticed. But these Shopee employees aren’t afraid to go the distance to ensure packages are dispatched in a timely fashion. Ever wondered what happens after you click “Add to Cart” on all your online purchases? That’s when a meticulous, behind-the-scenes journey of care and customer satisfaction begins. Every day, your Shopee orders are delivered to sorting centres in the evening, where they are organised based on shipping address. These are further divided by up to 1,000 designated delivery areas. Operations within the logistics warehouse run throughout the night to ensure that all packages are dispatched to its respective distribution area by 6am the next morning. The logistics department is supported by Shopee Xpress , an integrated logistics channel founded in August 2020 to facilitate the timely and reliable delivery of parcels. Said Mr Alvin Teo, director of regional operations at Shopee Singapore: “E-commerce delivery is a dynamic job that requires sorting staff, delivery personnel and collection point partners to work seamlessly and accurately to maintain high standards. We’re committed to constantly improving our systems and processes to optimise efficiency and uphold service standards.” TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK Ms Emaly Wang, a warehouse manager for Shopee, recounted her experience during the bustling 11.11 shopping festival, where she found herself dealing with double the usual number of orders. For Ms Wang and her team, it was a stressful period. Yet, undeterred by the immense workload, everyone focused on getting the job done. “The team put in extra effort to be more efficient and, in the end, we even surpassed our target,” she shared. “Whenever I feel discouraged, this moment always comes to mind. Knowing that our team is so supportive makes me believe there is nothing we cannot overcome.” In her role as a team leader, Ms Wang oversees multiple functions, including data analytics, project management and planning. Her role also involves working closely with the onsite operational team to explore new initiatives that drive enhanced performance as well as managing manpower resources within the warehouse. Among the many demanding aspects of her job, perhaps the most challenging lies in cultivating a sense of agility within her team. This entails ensuring that the warehouse and delivery units are primed to handle large order volumes and tight delivery timelines. In moments of adversity, Ms Wang makes it a point to prioritise essential tasks and to always put herself in the shoes of the customers she serves. ON-THE-GROUND RESPONSIVENESS Following the meticulous sorting process, the drivers step into action. Mr Mohamad Shahid, a delivery team supervisor at Shopee Xpress, works with pick-up and delivery units to understand their needs and address any challenges they encounter. Each driver usually handles 60 to 90 packages each trip. In cases where the number of packages becomes overwhelming, an additional trip is necessary to accommodate the volume. As a supervisor, Mr Shahid remains vigilant in identifying potential challenges faced by the pick-up and delivery teams. He constantly communicates with them to adapt processes if there is a surge in orders – which is common during major sale events. He said: “To deliver a pleasant experience to our customers, I believe continuous improvement is key. I am grateful to have good teammates whom I can work with to overcome obstacles together, as well as understanding superiors who are happy to step in and support us when needed.” DELIVERY WITH A HUMAN TOUCH Delivery riders and walkers play a crucial role in completing the final leg of the delivery process. For Ms Joey Lin, a part-time Shopee Xpress walker, delivering packages extends beyond mere package drop-offs. Her interaction with customers might be brief, but she often goes the extra mile to hand them their packages personally. If a customer is not home, she prefers to wait or make another trip to deliver the package. Every morning, she meets with a Shopee Xpress delivery driver to collect parcels and sorts them out at the void deck before embarking on her deliveries, which occasionally span the entire day. Sometimes, curious residents approach Ms Lin to ask if she had received permission to process packages there. Ms Lin would patiently explain that certain void deck areas in housing estates have received approval from the town council for package sorting. After this clarification, most residents become more understanding and receptive to the situation. The homemaker took on this role to remain active, as she often saw other delivery walkers around her neighbourhood. “Since becoming one myself, I have gotten more exercise and my fitness has improved,” said Ms Lin. She is assigned to a specific neighbourhood, where she covers nine blocks. In the one year that she has been with Shopee, she has become better acquainted with the surroundings and the community. Some regular customers now engage in conversation with her while receiving their items and have offered her beverages and snacks as a gesture of appreciation. For Ms Lin, a simple smile or ‘thank you’ from customers makes her happy and motivates her to work harder. “Some people may think that delivery staff don’t care about customers’ packages or just want to complete deliveries quickly. For me, building relationships with customers is very important. I enjoy chatting with customers and I treat their parcels with the same care as I would my own belongings,” she said. SELF-COLLECTION OFFERS YET MORE CONVENIENCE To enhance customer convenience, Shopee Xpress introduced a parcel self-collection service in January last year. This service provides customers with the option to retrieve their packages from designated collection points or Pick self-collection lockers. Presently, there are a total of 600 collection points spread across the island, encompassing diverse establishments such as convenience stores, mini-markets, mobile phone shops, eyewear stores, and shops within malls. Customers can retrieve their packages for free at these collection points, with no minimum spending requirement. Furthermore, there are 1,000 self-collection lockers available, mostly located around housing estates. One Shopee Xpress collection point is Rex Music and Colour Service, nestled within the heartlands of Eunos. The shop’s owner, Mr Chan Yong Chow, shared: “Our already sluggish business had worsened during the pandemic. But after becoming a collection point, many people who live or work nearby discovered our shop and the services we provide such as copying or printing documents, when they dropped by to retrieve their packages. The shop is also more active and lively.” Show your Shopee delivery driver, walker or collection points some appreciation when they deliver your packages from the 6.6 - 7.7 Great Shopee Sale .

Chiselled features – along with smooth and supple skin – have long been associated with youth and radiance. Photos: Bioskin An expert from Bioskin explains why contoured features are so sought after and elaborates on the non-invasive ways to achieve this look. Besides their A-list status, there is another thing that celebrities such as Fan Bingbing, Park Bo Gum and Keira Knightley have in common: They all have a well-defined visage that has emerged as a contemporary beauty ideal in recent years. A sculpted face on both men and women is considered aesthetically appealing, especially in Asia. Indeed, research showed that an oval-shaped face with a gracefully tapered jawline and delicately pointed chin was preferable among the study’s Chinese participants. There is also some evidence to show that people are more attracted to those with sculpted faces. But while some may have been fortunate enough to inherit naturally defined facial contours, others may struggle to attain the same level of sculpted beauty. Ms Chanel Tay, assistant training manager, Bioskin, delves into the factors that can get in the way of attaining a sculpted visage and shares what can be done to help one achieve this goal. THE YEARS TAKE A TOLL Chiselled features – along with smooth and supple skin – have long been associated with youth and radiance. But for most people, the natural process of ageing erodes these once-defined contours, leading to a loss of facial definition. According to Ms Tay, this is because skin loses its elasticity as we get older, while structural changes to the dermis cause it to gradually become thinner. “Our skin is at its peak in our 20s,” she said. “The marked decline in collagen production is the main culprit behind the appearance of ageing skin.” She added that the dwindling reserves of structural collagen and elastin proteins impede the skin’s ability to “spring back” into place, resulting in a sagging appearance. At the same time, a build-up of dead skin cells due to reduced cellular turnover contributes to dullness and the deepening of wrinkles. LIFESTYLE FACTORS ALSO PLAY A PART Ms Tay stressed that less-than-ideal lifestyle habits can exacerbate signs of ageing, especially where the inconsistent use of skincare is concerned. “Many people buy the latest top-of-the-line skincare products expecting quick results, but transformation does not happen overnight,” she said. “You must be diligent with your skincare regime for results to show.\" Most commonly, skin damage occurs because many people still have not made sun protection a priority. “Using sunscreen daily is the first step to minimising the formation of wrinkles. UVA and UVB rays degrade the skin’s DNA, leading to premature cellular death, which then impairs the skin’s ability to repair itself,” Ms Tay said, adding that UV rays also break down collagen and elastin in the skin. She recommends using sunscreen daily, reapplying it every two hours, to minimise the formation of wrinkles. “Additionally, high levels of stress can have an adverse effect on our skin,” she said. “Stress hormones, coupled with a diet that’s high in sugar and refined carbohydrates, can trigger inflammation. This, in turn, may manifest in more serious skin conditions such as hives or eczema.” ACHIEVING DEFINED FACIAL CONTOURS According to Ms Tay, a comprehensive skincare regime and the use of facial rollers to improve blood circulation may help alleviate signs of ageing. However, meticulous adherence to these practices is crucial to see results. She emphasised that for those with pronounced skin sagging or deep wrinkles, relying solely on these home remedies may not be sufficient to turn back the hands of time. That’s where a treatment such as Bioskin’s Master Contour Face Treatment comes into play, as it offers a targeted solution designed to restore facial volume, enhance jawline definition and diminish the appearance of laugh lines, fine lines and wrinkles. A crucial step in the treatment is the signature multi-lift face-sculpting technique and acupressure lifting massage. This is touted to improve the look of puppet lines and the nasolabial folds that extend from the nose to the corners of your mouth, enhance the jawline and plump the muscles in the apples of your cheeks. “The technique targets four facial acupressure points, namely the chengjiang point, dicang point, yingxiang point and zygomatic point,” Ms Tay said. “These are located in the areas of the face that are particularly prone to sagging – around the cheeks, chin and just below the sides of the nose.” Stimulating these four acupressure points via a lifting massage triggers the skin’s self-healing mechanism by encouraging muscle movement and lifting, added Ms Tay. At the same time, it promotes lymphatic drainage, eliminating facial puffiness and enhancing the jawline’s definition. Following this invigorating process, the needle-free gold collagen thread lift takes centre stage, where the face is treated to a potent dose of collagen serum that penetrates deeply into the skin. Ms Tay explained that this step – which encourages collagen remodelling and skin regeneration – enhances lifting and firming, while plumping up the skin and refining its texture. This is done in conjunction with the application of the master lift mask, which is fortified with high-performing ingredients. These include hydrolysed collagen to stimulate the production of collagen; bird’s nest extract to replenish nutrients in the skin, while promoting elasticity and firmness; and oat extract that not only protects and restores the skin's barrier, but also soothes irritated skin. By making subtle adjustments to your lifestyle, adopting a diligent skincare routine and seeking professional help from the experts, it may be possible to get those coveted sculpted facial contours. New customers can try Bioskin’s Master Contour Face Treatment at a special price of S$48* (before GST). Find out more about the treatment and book your appointment today. Terms and conditions apply.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Dorra Slimming offers shaping and wellness solutions tailored to the modern-day woman looking to trim the lower body, overcome plateaus by detoxing and achieve overall toning. (From left) NoonTalk Media artiste Kimberly Chia, actress Joanne Peh and Cross Ratio artiste Tay Kewei took on dorra's Ultimate Slimming Challenge in pursuit of their respective weight-related targets. Photos: dorra Slimming With its raft of targeted shaping and wellness solutions, dorra Slimming aims to help modern-day women looking to trim the lower body, overcome plateaus by detoxing or achieve overall toning. Setting body goals is a common resolution, but shedding those pounds is often easier said than done. Genetics, lifestyle habits and even sleep patterns play a role in an individual’s ability to manage weight. Local company dorra Slimming, which has seven outlets spread across the island, aims to help women achieve their ideal silhouette in a fuss-free way. The brand places a special focus on slimming treatments – all under an hour – that leverage technology and all-natural ampoules. To date, the slimming chain has served over 50,000 customers, including celebrity mums Joanne Peh, Kimberly Chia and Tay Kewei. The trio recently took part in dorra’s Ultimate Slimming Challenge, where a combination of customisable slimming treatments and home care products helped them tackle weight gain. According to dorra’s head slimming specialist Elle Sng, its signature solutions – Intense Fat Burning Slimming Treatment, Speedy Detox Treatment and Novashape Treatment – are designed to address three common body-related concerns faced by women today. BODY GOAL 1: TRIMMING THE LOWER BODY Lower body heft is troubling for many women – the tummy, hip and thigh area can be tricky to slim. “For extra help with these problem spots, we recommend the Intense Fat Burning Slimming Treatment ,” said Ms Sng. To address her postpartum lower body weight gain, Kimberly recently underwent this treatment, which includes a wrap that helps “even out tummy bulges”. Thereafter, an ampoule containing peptides and purple carnitine is applied to the problem area using a handheld infrared device. According to Ms Sng, the latter emits heat and light, helping the ampoule penetrate more deeply. “The peptides, which have a small molecular size, can reach the deeper layers beneath the skin and potentially help with trimming the lower body,” added Ms Sng. After two months of treatments, Kimberly noticed that she had dropped a size. “I could fit into some of my pre-pregnancy bottoms again,” she said. BODY GOAL 2: OVERCOMING PLATEAUS BY DETOXING Plateaus are a common speed bump experienced by women working on shaping up. Having encountered this, actress Joanne said: “It’s not just about losing weight. Like many women, I have some areas on my body that I have challenges toning, despite putting in the work.” Joanne brought those concerns to dorra and was prescribed a regimen that includes the Speedy Detox Treatment. “The treatment uses a seaweed clarifying ampoule that aims to flush out toxins, reduce cellulite, and improve skin tone and elasticity,” said Ms Sng. The ampoule contains natural ingredients like bladderwrack extract and caffeine that work in concert to tackle fat deposits and toxin build-up, shared the slimming specialist. Administered via a suction machine, the treatment includes a massage that facilitates lymphatic drainage for better circulation. Ms Sng added that treatment benefits go beyond slimming. “Customers have experienced improved bowel movement, reduced tension in the body and less ‘wind’ in the tummy – a boon for women who have just given birth.” For Joanne, the treatment helped her feel less sluggish, and her body was “firmer to the touch”, she shared. BODY GOAL 3: OVERALL TONING Ms Sng recommends dorra’s full-body treatment, the Novashape Treatment, for time-strapped women “looking for a relaxing way to tone up”. The therapist begins by applying a ‘fat-softening cream’ – enriched with guarana , capsaicin and Vitamin E – evenly on the body before using clingfilm wrap to enhance the cream’s absorption. “Therapists are trained to wrap the body in a way that’s specific to shaping and firming,” said Ms Sng. The customer then spends the next 20 to 30 minutes comfortably ensconced in an infrared spa capsule. Ms Sng shared that this form of infrared therapy raises the body’s core temperature, which can boost calorie burning , similar to what one would experience in a sauna, and has toning benefits. A HOLISTIC APPROACH Recognising that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to slimming, mother of three Kewei said: “Dorra offers customers a body-fat analysis and a one-to-one consultation to craft custom programmes that best suit one’s treatment needs.” These analyses help therapists identify red flags in the customer's daily habits and create a treatment plan that keeps in mind target areas that they’d like to work on. Customers typically start with one to two sessions a week, but this tapers down to once or twice a month when results start to show*. Kewei appreciates how dorra’s customised approach allows customers the flexibility of selecting add-ons to complement their treatment. She shared: “I chose to add the algae mask to my Intense Fat Burning Slimming Treatment because it’s specifically designed for postpartum weight loss with its firming and shaping properties.” Ms Sng added that “what you eat is as important as what you do”. At dorra, in-house nutritionists design sustainable meal plans tailored to the customer's needs and way of life. “Keeping up with a healthy diet and lifestyle will complement and sustain results for a longer period. It’s important to drink enough water, eat balanced meals, quit smoking, reduce alcohol intake and get at least eight hours of sleep daily,” she highlighted. Inspired by the results achieved by Joanne, Kimberly and Kewei in the Ultimate Slimming Challenge? Make an appointment with dorra Slimming today . First-time female customers can enjoy the signature Intense Fat Burning Slimming Treatment and C3 Slimming Kit for just S$28 (worth S$566). *Individual results may vary.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Going grey may be a natural part of getting older, but certain lifestyle habits may be exacerbating the problem, says a Bioskin expert. Bioskin’s Grey Hair Reverse Treatment is a chemical-free hair pigmentation treatment that targets the underlying causes of scalp and hair ageing. Photos: Bioskin Going grey may be a natural part of ageing, but certain lifestyle habits may be exacerbating the problem, says a Bioskin expert. Grey hair, often associated with maturity, wisdom and experience, has found its way into the hearts of Hollywood celebrities like Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo and Andie MacDowell, who proudly sport the salt-and-pepper look. For many of us, however, those silver strands can be seen as unwelcome reminders of the passage of time. While frequent chemical hair dyeing may provide a temporary fix, it fails to address the underlying cause of the problem. Is there anything one can do to slow down the process? According to Ms Doris Tan, assistant general manager at Bioskin, the transformation to grey hair can be explained by the science behind it. Our hair gets its colour from a pigment known as melanin. As we age, our hair follicles gradually produce less melanin due to a decrease in melanocytes, the cells responsible for its production. Consequently, during the natural process of hair regeneration, new strands are more likely to emerge in shades of grey . Beyond appearances, Ms Tan pointed out that greying hair is linked to hair health. “Grey hair is a sign that your tresses are no longer healthy – these strands tend to have a shorter lifespan, are more prone to breakage and are harder to manage,” she said. THE LIFESTYLE FACTORS THAT EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM The belief that stress is a contributing factor to premature greying holds more than a sliver of truth, said Ms Tan. Indeed, research showed that stress can accelerate the greying process by affecting the stem cells responsible for regenerating pigment. Underlying medical conditions may also be responsible for greying strands. Besides these, Ms Tan highlighted that smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and frequent late nights can lead to premature greying. “Poor nutrition and a deficiency in Vitamin B12, a nutrient that aids in melanin production, may also play a role,” she added. Neglecting hair hygiene is another factor. “Some people avoid washing their hair every day as they are worried about hair loss,” Ms Tan said. “But in Singapore’s hot and humid climate, not making this a daily habit can result in clogged hair follicles and affect hair health.” Frequent chemical treatments, including dyeing, bleaching and re-bonding, can also further damage hair roots. “The problem is exacerbated when people start colouring their hair regularly the moment they spot a few grey hairs,” she said. MITIGATING THE PROBLEM OF GREY HAIR Practising good hair hygiene, reducing stress levels and avoiding harsh chemical treatments are some of the measures you can implement to combat premature greying, said Ms Tan. For individuals whose greying is primarily due to lifestyle factors rather than medical conditions, there are professional treatments one can consider as well. Bioskin’s Grey Hair Reverse Treatment is a chemical-free hair pigmentation treatment that targets the underlying causes of scalp and hair ageing by nourishing the roots and providing essential nutrients to stimulate pigment production in melanocytes. “Bioskin’s advanced treatment is specially formulated to both cover and reverse grey hair. The treatment boosts the metabolism of the hair roots, promoting the regrowth of healthier and darker strands,” Ms Tan said. The treatment harnesses the power of natural herbs and botanical ingredients. These include green tea protein, an antioxidant said to improve the function of hair follicles; amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and has anti-ageing properties; cellulose to help retain moisture and enhance shine; as well as silk protein that nourishes the hair shaft and acts as a protective barrier against UV rays. Together, these ingredients promote hair growth, increase hair strength and improve the scalp’s health. Another key ingredient in the treatment is cold-pressed black seed oil from Sri Lanka, which has antibacterial and antifungal properties and contains a high concentration of the antioxidant thymoquinone to protect the scalp from free radical damage. “Black seed oil stimulates pigment production and prevents the premature ageing of melanocytes. It also has Omega-3 and Omega-6 to stimulate blood circulation,” Ms Tan explained. She added that the treatment is safe and non-invasive, with long-lasting results. Over time, customers can expect healthier hair with a semi-permanent reddish-brown hue. Ms Tan shared that most customers can see noticeable results after receiving the treatment bi-weekly for three to six months. “As the treatment progresses, the colour intensifies, which means individuals may no longer need frequent dye jobs to mask their grey hair,” she said. If you’re tired of constantly resorting to hair colouring to conceal grey strands, consider making improvements to your lifestyle and taking advantage of professional hair pigmentation treatments that may help reduce the need for frequent salon visits. New customers can try Bioskin’s Grey Hair Reverse Treatment at a special price of S$48* (before GST), which is inclusive of a relaxing shoulder massage.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Thanks to the efforts of its operations and customer service teams, the e-commerce giant has established an industry-leading standard to better protect consumer rights. Shopee's pledge to maintain an average processing time of two-and-a-half working days for refunds and return requests is shorter than the Consumers Association of Singapore's recommendation of seven days. Photos: Shopee Thanks to the efforts of its operations and customer service teams, the e-commerce giant has established an industry-leading standard to better protect consumer rights. Ms Evelyn Goh, a 48-year-old manager at a pharmaceutical consulting company, often purchases pet supplies online for her dog. She recalled receiving the wrong item on an order from Shopee previously, which led her to initiate a return request and seek a refund. She expected the process to be a complicated one, but to her relief, found it to be hassle-free. “I just needed to open the app, press a few buttons, submit some information and the application was completed,” said Ms Goh. Within a day, the issue was resolved. This seamless process is part of Shopee’s commitment to enhancing consumer protection and dispute resolution measures, enabling consumers to shop with peace of mind . This includes equipping its operations and customer service teams with the skills to manage challenges that arise, such as delivery issues and unsatisfactory customer experiences. GOLD STANDARD FOR PROCESSING RETURNS AND REFUNDS To foster a worry-free shopping experience and improve customer satisfaction, Shopee aims to maintain an average resolution time of 2.5 working days for processing returns and refunds – surpassing the industry norm of seven days that is recommended by the Consumers Association of Singapore. Mr Esten Mok, head of operations at Shopee, said: “It is impossible to have 100 per cent problem-free online transactions. Instead, it is crucial for e-commerce platforms to have in place a robust dispute management framework to ensure fair and prompt resolution of conflicts between buyers and sellers.” To bolster its customer service capabilities, Shopee has enhanced its app to facilitate direct communication between customers and customer service agents who specialise in handling return and refund requests. In addition, it has established a framework for evaluating the validity of such requests, leading to improvements in the fairness and efficiency of dispute resolution procedures. A CONCERTED EFFORT The seamless coordination among Shopee’s customer service teams plays a pivotal role in efficiently addressing customer requests for returns and refunds. Ms Nana Chong, returns and refunds manager at Shopee, said: “Our teams are available online seven days a week, from 8am to 10pm, to ensure that customer requests are handled promptly.” Shopee requires both the buyer and seller to provide evidence, such as photos or videos, so that its customer service teams can evaluate the quality of disputed products and ensure fair and consistent judgements based on Shopee’s arbitration framework. Common reasons for return and refund requests include issues involving incomplete, defective or damaged items, incorrect deliveries or counterfeit products. Ms Chong noted that, on occasion, the teams encounter tricky cases where seeking the expert opinion of a third party becomes necessary. She cited: “Once, a customer requested a return because he suspected that he had received a counterfeit product. Despite the seller providing a certificate of authenticity, we still sent the item, which was quite valuable, to experts for verification. The results confirmed the authenticity of the item.” Another challenging aspect involves mediating cases related to perishable food items. “Sometimes, food may spoil due to customers leaving the package outside for an extended period. In such cases, our agents will gather evidence from the seller to show that they have delivered the goods in consumable condition, or that the buyer had provided approval to the delivery worker to leave the order at the doorstep but did not arrive home in time to collect it before it went bad,” Ms Chong explained. Assisting with such investigations is all in a day’s work for Ms Invioni Theniu, a senior operations associate with Shopee’s customer service team. She manages complex cases that require additional support and are prioritised for further investigation. At times, Ms Theniu inadvertently becomes the target of customers’ frustration. However, she tries to empathise with affected customers, and listens patiently to their problems and requests. “The most important thing is to help customers resolve their issues as quickly as possible. I welcome any feedback to further improve our processes,” she said. Ms Theniu recalled an incident involving a customer who encountered difficulties registering a new address and making payment. After understanding the customer’s situation, she worked with the technical team to resolve the customer’s problem. The customer later expressed her gratitude to Ms Theniu through a heartfelt appreciation email. Such affirmation motivates Ms Theniu and her team to strive towards constantly improving the shopping experience for customers. HELPING YOU SHOP CONFIDENTLY To build trust among its users, Shopee maintains stringent measures to ensure the authenticity of sellers on its platform. According to Mr Jonathan Kok, who leads Seller Operations at Shopee, prospective sellers must undergo a real-name authentication process or provide company registration documents, and pass Shopee’s verification procedure. “Sellers must also comply with the platform’s rules and terms. Swift action is taken in the event of any violation,” he said. Shopee uses a penalty points system to regulate seller conduct. Sellers who accumulate penalty points for platform violations may face restrictions – such as an exclusion from marketing campaigns – in their operations on Shopee. The platform also implements other consumer protection initiatives, such as Shopee Mall , which guarantees product authenticity and free returns; Shopee Preferred Sellers , a recognition of sellers who have high shop reviews and excellent service; as well as Shopee Guarantee , a secure payment feature that releases payment to sellers only after buyers have confirmed the receipt of items in good condition and expressed satisfaction with their purchases. Shopee also provides a range of training resources to help sellers improve their performance. “Sellers can log in to the Seller Education Hub to learn how to better operate on Shopee. They can also join the online seller community to exchange ideas with peers and learn tips to enhance their operations,” said Mr Kok. Indeed, creating a smoother online shopping experience necessitates collaboration among buyers, sellers and the e-commerce platform itself. Said Mr Mok: “With strong coordination among Shopee’s customer service teams and a robust dispute management framework, we strive to resolve online shopping disputes promptly. In this way, we improve the efficiency of transactions, strengthen buyers’ confidence in using Shopee, and optimise time and resource utilisation for our sellers. By actively implementing consumer protection initiatives, we create a reliable and satisfying user experience for both buyers and sellers on Shopee.” Enjoy a worry-free online shopping experience with Shopee .

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Through its innovative degree programmes and campus-wide initiatives, James Cook University is doing its part to drive sustainable practices in Singapore. By educating students and staff about sustainability, universities can cultivate change agents, says Prof May Tan-Mullins, JCU’s dean international and chief sustainability officer. Photo: Mediacorp Studio 3 Through its innovative degree programmes and campus-wide initiatives, James Cook University is doing its part to drive sustainable practices in Singapore. For many students, a typical souvenir from one’s university would be a T-shirt, a decorative wall pennant or perhaps a school-branded notebook. At the Singapore campus of James Cook University (JCU), keepsakes take on a more profound significance, intertwining eco-consciousness with a sense of purpose. Bolstered by seed funding earmarked for sustainability, the university recently acquired a plastic recycling machine, transforming plastic waste into meaningful souvenirs for its students, said Professor May Tan-Mullins, JCU’s dean international and chief sustainability officer. This is only one aspect of JCU’s dedication to sustainability, which extends beyond its campus borders and takes shape in diverse efforts. They include on-site innovations like installing energy-efficient photocell-controlled lighting and using an eco-shredder to recycle branches and leaves into compost, as well as broader collaborative pursuits, such as partnering with Singapore National Employers Federation to instil sustainability-focused training. A pivotal testament to JCU’s commitment is the introduction of the Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science programme at its Singapore campus. The degree programme seeks to equip graduates with the essential skills to shape effective environmental strategies for businesses and guide them into a more sustainable future. LEADING THE CHARGE IN SUSTAINABILITY In line with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the United Nations , JCU is actively supporting the Ministry of Education’s target of a two-thirds reduction in net carbon emissions from the education sector by 2030, as well as the Singapore Green Plan 2030 agenda on sustainable development. Prof Tan-Mullins, who also leads JCU Singapore’s Sustainability Working Group, which was established in April last year, said JCU’s commitment stems from the belief that a united societal effort is necessary to address global sustainability concerns and build a more inclusive and resilient future for the world. “Universities are hotspots for innovation and learning, with the power to extend the impact to surrounding communities and society. By educating students and staff about what they can do for sustainability, we can cultivate change agents and drive progress across various SDGs,” she said. To realise this vision, JCU leverages its research clusters – such as the Sustainability Research Cluster and the Ethics, Organisations and Society Research Cluster – to spearhead its multifaceted and interdisciplinary approaches in studying sustainability. UNITING BUSINESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE This same approach informs the Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science programme, housed within the JCU Singapore Business School – an institution accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The AACSB distinction is held by less than 6 per cent of university-level business schools worldwide. To align the programme with industry needs and prevailing best practices in Singapore, the university collaborated with businesses to identify their requirements within the environmental sector, customising its academic components and learning outcomes accordingly. According to Prof Tan-Mullins, the programme’s uniqueness lies in its blend of business acumen and environmental expertise. Students undertake both business and environmental science subjects, including electives in areas like aquaculture, coastal and marine management, and field studies in tropical geography. As they gain an understanding of biodiversity and ecology, they will also be trained in economics, accounting and management. This comprehensive approach empowers graduates to navigate a business landscape where environmental considerations increasingly drive consumer choices, and prepares them for environmental, social and governance roles in both public and private sectors. “Our faculty possesses extensive understanding of Singapore’s sustainability demands and skilfully integrates these elements into the curriculum,” said Prof Tan-Mullins. “Their diverse expertise and ongoing research enable them to guide students in tackling region-specific environmental challenges.” For students aspiring to propel Singapore’s sustainability journey, she advises embracing curiosity, fostering interdisciplinary thinking and developing critical thinking skills. “Harness your passion,” she added, “to bring about positive change on the path to creating a more sustainable world.” Enrol in the AACSB-accredited Bachelor of Business and Environmental Science programme at James Cook University in Singapore, and be a force for positive change in the world.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight The COVID-19 pandemic hit these job-seekers hard, but upskilling at NTUC LearningHub helped them to forge new career paths . Embracing a growth mindset to facilitate her career transition, Ms Lilik Mariyatin now serves as a healthcare assistant in a hospital. Photos: NTUC LearningHub The COVID-19 pandemic hit these job-seekers hard, but upskilling at NTUC LearningHub helped them to forge new career paths. Once the owner of a thriving salad bar, Ms Lilik Mariyatin found herself at a loss when the pandemic forced the shuttering of her seven-year-old business in mid-2020. “I was worried about maintaining financial stability, especially as I was supporting my teenage son’s education,” she said. “I was also concerned about the welfare of my staff and their families.” The weight of these anxieties bore down heavily on Ms Lilik. To fill her time constructively, she turned her attention to volunteering, actively participating in the distribution of food to low-income families affected by the pandemic. In time, her stint as a volunteer inspired her to strike out in a new career. Ms Lilik, who is in her early 40s and had no experience in the healthcare sector, resolved to embark on a new professional journey – one where her contributions could tangibly improve the lives of others. A friend introduced her to the SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme Healthcare Assistant course at NTUC LearningHub , previously known as the SGUnited Skills Healthcare Assistant course. At NTUC LearningHub , a continuing education and training provider that focuses on outcome-based training and the development of job-ready skills, Ms Lilik discovered newfound enthusiasm for learning and embraced a growth mindset to facilitate her career transition. Additionally, she appreciated the trainer’s ability to impart invaluable industry insights while infusing lessons with a touch of humour. “Meeting fellow course mates from diverse backgrounds made me realise I wasn’t the only one making a career switch, and this made things less daunting,” she shared. Upon completing the course in late 2022, Ms Lilik secured a position as a healthcare assistant in a hospital, where her responsibilities include managing patients’ nutrition and fluid requirements, mobility assistance and patient communication. Her mastery of these competencies is a testament to the skills-based training provided by NTUC LearningHub. Said Ms Lilik: “The course curriculum is both comprehensive and tailored to industry demands, offering a high-quality learning experience. I’ve not only gained a fresh set of skills but have also transitioned into a new career path that offers financial stability and, above all, the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of others.” Like Ms Lilik, Mr Calvin Tan and Mr Vikaraman Rajaratanam grappled with their own pandemic-induced career crossroads. Fuelled by a determination to adapt to the shifting employment landscape, both gentlemen turned to NTUC LearningHub for reskilling and upskilling opportunities. Equipped with newly acquired capabilities, they successfully secured positions in their respective fields. REFRESHING HIS PROJECT MANAGEMENT SKILL SET Since 2017, Mr Tan, 38, had been running a board game shop that welcomed families and friends for leisurely play and camaraderie. Playtime ended, however, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020. Mr Tan shifted his business online, but he also knew he had to develop a plan for the long term. Contemplating the uncertain timeline of the pandemic, Mr Tan thought: “What if the pandemic persists for a year, or even two?” Driven by these concerns, he decided to return to the corporate world. Formerly a project management professional, Mr Tan charted a return to the field. Knowing that he had to update his skill set to compete in the present-day job market, he enrolled for courses in Agile and project management at NTUC LearningHub. “Tech is an ever-evolving sector. What you learnt today can become obsolete tomorrow,” he explained. “This is something I tell my friends – that I must know ‘what is happening tomorrow, yesterday’. That’s why my motto is to never stop learning.” Armed with his newfound proficiencies, Mr Tan secured a role as an assistant project manager in the IT software development sector in 2021. Today, as a project manager, he attributes his success in the field to the courses he undertook at NTUC LearningHub, which enhanced his value as an employee. The knowledge he acquired remains acutely relevant to his current work: “I am engaged in various projects that span the gamut from Waterfall to Agile methodologies. Not all companies in Singapore have embraced the Agile approach, and hence, I need to enlighten my clients on its benefits, such as how Agile methodology enables iterative adjustments, resulting in outcomes that align more closely with their expectations.” During his time at NTUC LearningHub, he had the opportunity to interact with peers from tech and non-tech backgrounds. “I was particularly inspired by a fellow course mate who was a senior in his late 50s,” he recalled. “He exemplified what it means to never stop learning.” Taking this motto on board, Mr Tan chose to continue upskilling even beyond the pandemic. Last December, he signed up for NTUC LearningHub’s Project Management Institute (PMI)-Agile Certified Practitioner course : “PMI is the gold standard in project management and possessing this credential will propel me even further in my career.” BECOMING MORE AGILE IN TECH After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and a master’s degree in management, Mr Vikaraman, 33, embarked on his career as a project engineer in the construction industry. However, harbouring a longstanding passion for technology, he soon decided to set his course in that direction. He joined a local IT start-up but was retrenched in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Undaunted, Mr Vikaraman knew that he had to upskill to remain employable. He turned to NTUC LearningHub, completing most of the Certified Scrum Master , Certified Scrum Product Owner and ICAgile courses, in addition to courses in cloud engineering. “I had a keen interest in Agile and Scrum methodologies. The Agile courses from NTUC LearningHub appealed to me as they were funded by the Institute of Banking and Finance, and NTUC LearningHub has a good track record for delivering quality courses.” Besides the engaging course curriculum, Mr Vikaraman enjoyed networking with and learning from his course mates. “The insights shared by trainers, who are industry practitioners themselves, also broadened my perspectives,” he added. Today, as an innovation executive at a homegrown supply chain solutions firm with an expansive Asian network, Mr Vikaraman said that his new skills enable him to contribute to the digital transformation of his workplace. “These skills have helped me in my job, where I am involved in exploring technologies and innovations such as artificial intelligence, 5G, Internet of Things, robotics and automation,” he said. “The Agile mindset has empowered me to generate ideas that are out of the box.” Mr Vikaraman, who plans to specialise in areas such as cybersecurity and move into a consulting role, reflected that lifelong learning is as much about changing oneself as it is about changing careers. He said: “It is important to be open and to have a growth mindset where you are always seeking opportunities to upskill and pivot into emerging industries.” Thinking of a career switch? Take the first step by visiting NTUC LearningHub to learn how upskilling can help you.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Prepare for spine-chilling spectacles and legendary monsters this Halloween season. Can you survive till the end at Nights of Fright's most terrifying edition yet? Photos: Sunway Lagoon Prepare for spine-chilling spectacles and legendary monsters this Halloween season. Whether it’s the nightmarish visage of Freddie Krueger that invades your dreams or the eerie laughter of the pontianak that sends chills down your spine, the realm of the supernatural has long captivated the human imagination, inciting both terror and exhilaration. This September, gear up for an amplified dose of both as Sunway Lagoon unveils an array of bone-tingling attractions for the ninth edition of its annual Halloween extravaganza Nights of Fright . Said Mr Calvin Ho, executive director of Sunway Theme Parks: “For an electrifying experience that caters to thrill-seekers, our passionate production team has gone the extra mile to create four brand-new haunted houses inspired by terrors from the East and West for Nights of Fright 9 (NOF9).” RUN, AND DON’T LOOK BACK Have you ever watched a horror movie and thought you could outsmart the villain? Here’s your chance to pit your wits against a nefarious barber with a secret. At The Legend of Sweeney Todd: Barbershop Killer of Fleet Street, you’ll journey back to the Victorian era and confront the notorious razor-wielding fiend. As you flee from his clutches, think twice about accepting the meat pies baked by his devilish partner Mrs Lovett. Once you’ve successfully navigated the labyrinthine walls of this attraction, head to the back of the park for even more terrifying thrills at Texas Chainsaw Massacre - Out.Back.Attack! Here, wandering visitors will chance upon Leatherface’s secret sheds, where it won’t take long to register that the scattered pieces of skin don’t come from animals. Get ready to run for your life when the maniac announces his appearance with the deafening roar of his iconic chainsaw. ENCOUNTERS OF THE UNDEAD KIND If you manage to escape from the serial killers, don’t celebrate just yet. With two show stages and a haunted theatre, NOF9 promises even more nightmarish encounters. Expect to be caught in the middle of a botched ritual led by a malevolent witch queen or to cross paths with a vengeful Little Red Riding Hood. Perhaps the most harrowing experience would be finding yourself in the midst of two zombie hordes. As you flee from the ravenous undead, reminiscent of those from The Walking Dead, be on the lookout for the robed Asian zombies. Don’t let their stiff gait fool you, as they will pounce when you least expect it. TERRIFYING TALES FROM ASIA The power of cultural familiarity is the reason for NOF9’s heavy emphasis on presenting terrors close to home. Grab a bite at Madame Zhu’s Noodle House, designed to resemble the restaurants of Hong Kong. If you’re finding the quiet atmosphere unsettling, there’s a reason: Beware of the unhinged chef who’s bent on serving up his sinister menu. Over at Animalium, you’ll explore a toxic wasteland where survivors have mutated into were-creatures resembling the animals of the Chinese zodiac. The scares at NOF9 are not limited to designated areas; the entire park has been transformed into a canvas for horror. “Our Fields of Fear are designed to plunge every guest into a nightmarish realm,” said Mr Ho. “Be warned: A pocong (shrouded corpse) or a pontianak could be lurking around the corner.” Test your mettle at Sunway Lagoon’s Nights of Fright 9 , happening from Sep 29 till Oct 31, every Friday to Sunday from 7.30pm to 11.30pm. Admission tickets start from RM128 (S$37.25), with the option to add an Xpress Pass to skip queues at selected rides and attractions for RM98. The VIP Package, which costs RM298, includes a themed dinner, event memorabilia and exclusive photo opportunities with the cast.

Mr Richard Hong, CEO of TÜV SÜD ASEAN (left) and Mr Tay Ee Learn, chief sector skills officer of NTUC LearningHub, want to empower more companies and business professionals to embrace sustainability. Photos: Mediacorp Studio 3 NTUC LearningHub’s exclusive partnership with TÜV SÜD offers a job-ready certification that is financially accessible and endorsed by prominent companies. In the realm of corporate sustainability, action speaks louder than words. It involves intentionally embedding green practices into every facet of business operations and overarching strategy. For many businesses, navigating the array of challenges and opportunities presented by sustainability can be daunting. NTUC LearningHub’s Special Report 2022 on Sustainability found that while nine in 10 business leaders recognised the importance of integrating sustainability into their business strategy, 41 per cent cited the lack of specialised talent or expertise as a barrier to setting sustainability goals. Even when companies manage to formulate sustainability strategies, they often encounter roadblocks: 47 per cent of respondents identified a dearth of expertise as an obstacle in shaping these strategies. In addition, 86 per cent of business leaders agreed that there was a gap in expertise and skill sets required for steering sustainability initiatives within their organisation. To bridge this knowledge gap and empower more companies and business professionals to embrace sustainable practices, NTUC LearningHub has collaborated with the academy division of TÜV SÜD in Singapore, an internationally recognised provider of safety, quality, security and sustainability solutions, to introduce the Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management ISO Standards . INDUSTRY-LEADING EDUCATION FROM PROMINENT PROVIDERS NTUC LearningHub, committed to enhancing the employability of working individuals through continuous education and training, has been a driving force since 2004, having assisted over 29,000 organisations and provided more than 2.6 million training opportunities. Commenting on its exclusive partnership with TÜV SÜD in Singapore in launching the Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management ISO Standards, Mr Tay Ee Learn, chief sector skills officer of NTUC LearningHub, highlighted the expertise of TÜV SÜD in facilitating the adoption and maintenance of rigorous ISO sustainability standards. Mr Tay said: “Not only will the certification address the rising demand for sustainability-trained professionals, it also supports graduates and mid-career professionals who aspire to equip themselves with market-ready competencies to take on in-demand sustainability-related job roles.” TÜV SÜD in Singapore, a wholly owned subsidiary of TÜV SÜD AG, specialises in testing, inspection, certification, auditing and training services. Since 1866, the company has remained committed to advancing progress by protecting people, the environment and assets from technology-related risks. Through a global workforce exceeding 26,000 employees across more than 1,000 locations, TÜV SÜD adds value to customers and partners by enabling market access and managing risks to create a safer and more sustainable future. EXCELLING IN SUSTAINABILITY The Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management has been well-received by participants eager to elevate their workplace contributions and careers. Mr Au Yang Sian, director and regional head of operations planning and inventory at Zuellig Pharma Holdings, said that one module – the ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity Management System Implementer Training – offered a particularly engaging learning experience. “The programme’s thoughtful design incorporates ample opportunities for class discussion, engaging video content that enhances understanding, and practical exercises to facilitate the application of acquired concepts. Additionally, it offers a preparatory online component, allowing busy professionals to access the material at their own pace and preferred timing through a user-friendly platform,” he shared. His colleague Shamsir Ali, a regional quality assurance and health, safety, security and environment manager, called the module an “enlightening experience”. Said Mr Shamsir: “The comprehensive content gives us an in-depth understanding of business continuity management, equipping us with the knowledge and skills necessary for practical application in real-world scenarios.” Intended for sustainability and sustainability-linked professionals, including facilities and operations managers, strategy consultants, finance managers and environment professionals, the certification offers two tracks: Facility and cybersecurity. Participants of the facility track undergo a specialised module titled ISO 41001:2018 Facility Management Systems Implementer Training, while those on the cybersecurity track have the opportunity to attend the Cybersecurity Essentials and Trustmark course. Both tracks encompass essential modules covering pertinent subjects, such as business continuity, information security, anti-bribery and energy management. The tailored curriculum imparts universal sustainability principles and best practices that can be adapted across diverse industries. The tracks empower participants to tackle environmental challenges, such as transitioning to renewable energy, making data centres more sustainable, meeting sustainability reporting requirements and optimising carbon credits. According to Mr Zack Lee of Greensafe International, the certification’s ISO 22301:2019 Business Continuity Management System Implementer Training module has enhanced his proficiency in developing and overseeing robust business continuity plans. Much like Mr Au and Mr Shamsir, he enjoyed the interactive style of learning, which encourages engagement with both instructors and peers. ACCESS TO FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB-READY LEARNING The Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management is designed to be accessible to those passionate about driving sustainability in the business world. Depending on the funding programme offered, both individuals and corporate-sponsored participants can enjoy up to 70 per cent SkillsFuture Singapore funding for course fees. In addition, corporate-sponsored learners under the Career Conversion Programme or Place-and-Train Programme receive between 70 and 90 per cent salary support during the course. The certification boasts a flexible learning structure with stackable credentials, encompassing five modules to be completed within two years. Embracing a learner-centric approach, the curriculum employs a flipped classroom technique that entails e-learning, classroom instruction and project-based work. Upon completing all modules, participants undergo a job-readiness assessment by TÜV SÜD in Singapore, culminating in a professional certificate endorsed by both NTUC LearningHub and TÜV SÜD in Singapore. Mr Richard Hong, CEO of TÜV SÜD ASEAN, said: “In launching the stackable ISO credential pathway, we are not only equipping individual professionals with widely recognised qualifications applicable across industries but also empowering them to become invaluable contributors to businesses on their sustainability journey. Besides enhancing employability, this initiative opens doors to in-demand roles across various growth sectors, catalysing a transformative workforce primed for a sustainable future.” Enquire and sign up for the TÜV SÜD Professional Certification in Business Sustainability Management at NTUC LearningHub today.

Sustainability is an imperative that resonates deeply with SUSS' mission, as highlighted by Prof Ang Hak Seng, director of the Centre of Excellence for Social Good at SUSS (left), and Dr Tan Eng Joo, head of Graduate Programmes in Sustainability Management. Photos: Mediacorp Studio 3 From stackable programme offerings to tailored consultancy services and strategic alliances, the Singapore University of Social Sciences is building sustainability capabilities for the future. What does ‘social good’ mean to you? While the term might evoke images of food drives or fundraising efforts for worthy causes, Professor Ang Hak Seng of the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) envisions a more profound impact that transcends the present day. “At SUSS, we believe that social good encompasses the creation of a community and an environment for future generations,” said Prof Ang, who serves as the director of the Centre of Excellence for Social Good (CESG), SUSS. CESG goes beyond its role as a think tank focused on advancing social good; it also serves as a catalyst for building social alliances and plays a pivotal role in developing the capacity of the people sector at a national level. Added Prof Ang: “CESG is committed to equipping sectors with the necessary skills to embrace social good causes such as sustainability. We conduct research on how organisations can do good, do right and do well, which is a delicate balancing act. Through this research, we develop best practices to help the ecosystem to rapidly scale up their sustainability practices.” Sustainability takes on an interdisciplinary approach at SUSS, addressing not just environmental concerns but also the complex web of social and business challenges. In addition to launching a suite of graduate-level sustainability management programmes, the university has formalised a partnership through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with professional services firm RSM. This alliance aims to empower small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore to integrate sustainability into their operations and business models. The focus on SMEs is a strategic one, as these businesses lack the capacity to readily hire sustainability experts due to their smaller size and resource constraints. However, as SMEs employ more than 70 per cent of Singapore’s workforce, they have the potential to generate a substantial and widespread influence on Singapore’s sustainability landscape. “Embarking on sustainability can strengthen SMEs. It builds business resilience within the supply chain, reduces operational costs through process optimisation and drives innovation, enabling SMEs to venture into new markets,” noted Prof Ang. “An SME that refuses to adopt sustainable practices may risk alienating younger consumers and miss out on attracting fresh talent by failing to align with the values of the younger generation.” GUIDING SMES ON THEIR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEYS According to Prof Ang, SUSS’ MOU with RSM is laser-focused on three crucial aspects – the creation of a training curriculum, sustainability research and engagement in consultancy projects. These areas have been identified as gaps that SMEs often encounter when striving to weave sustainability into their operations. “The training programmes help to address the sustainability knowledge gaps that SMEs have, while the consultancy projects are designed to bridge the gap in practical expertise in implementing sustainability practices,” explained Prof Ang. “Our research endeavours aim to meet the need for sustainability best practices, such as easily adoptable sustainability standards of practice for scaling up within an organisation.” To mitigate the issue of limited resources and expertise, SUSS is offering affordable consultancy services to SMEs looking for guidance in their sustainability journeys. Working alongside industry experts, including its partner RSM, CESG will provide consultancy sessions, toolkits and other tailored resources to help kickstart the process for SMEs. “To keep costs affordable, we will also tap on skills-based volunteers who have deep sustainability knowledge and the passion to support SMEs through the consultancy process,” revealed Prof Ang. “We intend to roll out this consultancy initiative as a pilot programme next year.” To help close the knowledge gap, SUSS will work with Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs) and other industry partners to carry out joint research, organise regular sustainability forums, facilitate Community of Practice sharing sessions for participants in the SME consultancy programme, and create templates and guidelines for sustainability initiatives. Recognising the unique sustainability needs inherent to different sectors, SUSS plans to seek insights and feedback from TACs to ensure that the training programmes developed under the MOU offer a tailored fit for SMEs across various industries. The programmes will be scalable, stackable and flexible, allowing SME staff to acquire the skillsets essential for their career development – and to help their companies go greener, faster. EDUCATING A NEW COHORT OF SUSTAINABILITY LEADERS Ensuring that Singapore has a pipeline of sustainability-savvy talent is top of mind for Dr Tan Eng Joo, head of Graduate Programmes in Sustainability Management and the co-chair of SUSS’ sustainability committee. Dr Tan oversees the Graduate Certificate in Sustainability Management and the Graduate Diploma in Sustainability Management . Together with the Master of Management with a specialisation in Sustainability Management , these programmes are currently accepting applications for classes scheduled to begin in January next year. The Master of Social Entrepreneurship – which will be launched later in 2024 – also includes a sustainability track, aimed at developing a focused understanding on best practices for Singapore’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) ecosystem and global ESG standards. According to Dr Tan, postgraduates are the target demographic for SUSS’ sustainability management programmes as they can leverage their professional expertise and networks to put their newly acquired knowledge to good use. Said Dr Tan: “Postgraduate students tend to better appreciate the complexity of sustainability challenges and the need for coordinated, interdisciplinary solutions. Their professional connections make them well-suited to implement such solutions, in addition to being advocates and change agents. Also, those who are further along in their careers are better positioned to lead, drive and support the transformational change that is often needed to create positive impact.” Developed in collaboration with industry partners to guarantee the curriculum’s direct applicability in the workplace, the sustainability management programmes at SUSS are aimed at young professionals seeking to build careers in the sustainability sector, mid-to-senior managers entrusted with ESG-related responsibilities, and individuals possessing technical expertise – such as in energy efficiency or photovoltaic systems – who are transitioning into managerial roles. “Even professionals in roles related to environmental stewardship and those facilitating the broader sustainability ecosystem, such as consultants, can benefit from our programmes,” highlighted Dr Tan. Furthermore, SUSS has forged strategic alliances with RSM and the Building and Construction Authority to jointly shape and deliver selected courses. Said Dr Tan: “We regularly scan the sustainability landscape to ensure the continued relevance of our programmes. For instance, the issuance of the IFRS S1 and S2 by the International Sustainability Standards Board represents a noteworthy development that will be integrated into our Sustainability Reporting course.” In an effort to give learners the flexibility to tailor their educational journey according to their professional demands, schedules and personal commitments, these programmes are designed to be stackable, allowing for customisation through elective courses that zoom in on specific sectors and job functions. These specialised areas can include the built environment and procurement. Said Dr Tan: “The urgency of climate change demands that professionals at every career stage swiftly acquire the skills and knowledge required to mitigate climate risk and propel the shift towards a sustainable future.” Visit suss.edu.sg to learn more about sustainability-related qualifications and initiatives.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Level up your confidence with compression wear and waist trainers that provide contouring solutions for women at every life stage. The Lazywaist shapewear range aims to deliver the desired combination of abdominal support, comfort and ease of use. Photos: Lazywaist Level up your confidence with compression wear and waist trainers that provide contouring solutions for women at every life stage. In an age shaped by digital influences, the relentless pursuit of unrealistic body ideals fuelled by media exposure and societal norms has thrust an unnecessary weight on women. In an effort to democratise body shaping, Ms Jas Chua launched Lazywaist Co , a solutions-based shapewear company. “Shapewear can be harnessed as a tool of empowerment. This led us to create a line that is backed by science and can help women feel and look better in a safe manner,” said Ms Chua. MATERIAL MATTERS Guided by the principles of effectiveness, comfort and a personalised approach to body contouring, Ms Chua’s goal was to make shapewear accessible to women in all seasons of their lives. One key factor that enhances the wearability and versatility of Lazywaist’s products is the meticulous selection of material. “Our compression shaping range featuring The Slim (high-waisted sculpting pants) and The Sculpt (an arm-shaping top) is crafted from the same medical-grade material used by South Korean plastic surgeons in post-liposuction compression wear,” she said. She pointed out that numerous patients in South Korea who had undergone liposuction were required to wear compression garments continuously for a minimum of 72 hours. As such, it was imperative for the material to be moisture-wicking, comfortable and lightweight. Similar attention to detail went into developing The Fix, a double-layered zipper shaper that targets the midsection. “The Fix is crafted from neoprene, a material commonly found in wetsuits. In addition to being soft and lightweight, neoprene naturally retains heat. Women who wish to enhance sweat production during a workout session can consider wearing the garment under their gym-wear,” said Ms Chua. Beyond its functional qualities, shapewear can also feel luxurious. The Desire, a contouring underwear from the Lazywaist collection, touts intricate lace detailing, lending it a sumptuous finish. EFFECTIVE COMPRESSION WITHOUT DISCOMFORT Compression wear refers to snug, elastic clothing designed to compress and provide support to underlying tissues in the body and limbs. This concept is thought to mitigate the effects of gravity and promote improved posture and wound healing. Such garments are widely used in sports to boost blood circulation and ease muscle swelling after workouts , and harnessed in medical therapy to address conditions such as varicose veins. Lazywaist’s compression range offers compression levels that closely resemble those found in medical-grade compression wear. “Doctors typically prescribe compression wear with levels at 40mmHg and above while our products feature compression levels of 35mmHg. This slightly lower figure ensures comfort for daily wear while still providing nearly identical benefits,” explained Ms Chua. Illustrating her point, Ms Chua shared that The Slim is expected to provide double the compression compared to regular yoga pants. Lazywaist’s compression and shapewear range is a favourite among air stewardesses, offering support during long periods of standing and helping them maintain a sleek physique in their fitted uniforms. The Lazywaist collection has been put to the test by a diverse group of women, including four mum-influencers – Ms Mongchin Yeoh, Ms Cheryl Chin, Ms Melissa Koh and Ms Selina Ong – who shared their experience at the brand’s launch on Sep 19. First-time mothers Ms Yeoh and Ms Chin have discovered The Slim to be a valuable addition to their regimens. For Ms Yeoh, it has become an essential companion on long-haul flights, ensuring improved lower body circulation. She reflected: “I’ve noticed a reduction in water retention and my body appears less bloated.” Meanwhile, Ms Chin has integrated The Slim into her fitness sessions, boosting compression during her gym and Pilates workouts. Additionally, it helps her achieve a more streamlined figure. POSTPARTUM BODY SHAPING It is important to align one’s shaping objectives with the right shapewear, especially when addressing a specific need such as postpartum body shaping. Ms Chua shared that the postpartum period is often regarded as “a golden phase of recovery”, characterised by pelvic expansion and “a more adaptable body state”, making postpartum binders beneficial in contouring and supporting the abdominal area. While waist training is a common practice in European countries, there are limited products designed to suit the Asian physique in the market, said Ms Chua. For this reason, Lazywaist developed a waist training collection tailored for Asian body types, comprising The Fix and The Shape (a waist trainer with nine-steel boning) . “The latter is ideal for new mothers, serving as a postpartum binder to gently sculpt the waistline by tucking in ‘tummy pouches’,” she explained. Ms Yeoh shared that she paired The Shape with Lazynote, an in-house eight-week waist training programme with prescribed specific wear hours. “When used in concert, the regimen offered effective waist support. Just a few hours of daily wear made me feel like I was on my way to reclaiming my pre-pregnancy shape,” she said. A third-time mother, Ms Koh revealed that the Lazywaist range marked her introduction to waist trainers and compression wear. “The team encouraged me to progress at my own pace with Lazynote and I still managed to achieve pleasing results,” she said. To round out a holistic postpartum shaping routine, women can incorporate The Slim into their regime – these sculpting pants can help manage postpartum swelling in the thighs, hips and calves due to their compression properties. In support of new mothers, Lazywaist has curated a special postpartum bundle for full-body contouring. And to facilitate the breastfeeding experience, women can try the seamless and wire-free Love-me-Tender nursing bra . Engineered with comfort and convenience in mind, the bra features an ultra-soft breathable nylon-spandex blend and includes sewn-in padding, making washing hassle-free without the need to remove separate pads. “I’ve tried various nursing bras in the past but Love-me-Tender stands out as the most comfortable and cooling option. I appreciate how the bra provides support without underwire,” said Ms Koh. SHAPING GOALS ACROSS LIFE STAGES Women of all life stages can benefit from wearing shapewear regularly or for special occasions. “The advantages include having better posture and enhanced confidence, resulting from a sleeker and more polished appearance,” said Ms Chua. Mum-preneur Ms Ong, a co-founder of a luxury hair salon, is a fan of The Shape for its ability to refine her silhouette. She said: “I wear it daily and appreciate the posture and back support it provides, especially since I spend long hours on my feet in heels at work.” Acknowledging that unrealistic body standards can have detrimental effects on an individual’s self-image, Ms Chua believes that embracing yourself no matter your body type is the first step to feeling good. “Good shapewear can give you that extra boost by helping you fit better in clothes, but true beauty arises from finding contentment within yourself,” she said.

This year's National STEM Championship was won by Anglo-Chinese School (Independent). Photos: Mediacorp The National STEM Championship showcases young innovators going beyond book smarts to pit their analytical, scientific and communication skills against one another. It’s the time of the year again when secondary school students in Singapore dive into challenges that reveal how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) impact our lives. Formerly known as the National Science Challenge, the National STEM Championship (NSTEMC) aims to highlight emerging technologies and spark a passion for STEM subjects among students and the wider public. In addition to the usual quizzes and tasks, NSTEMC participants are thrust into real-world scenarios during Onsite Challenges, where they must devise innovative solutions within a tight timeframe. Dr Wu Yan, principal scientist at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), commended this year’s finalists for their demonstration of critical thinking and creativity. “They sought innovative approaches and drew from personal experiences to tackle problems, showcasing a remarkable ability to think outside the box.” SURPRISES AND SECOND CHANCES The victors of this year’s NSTEMC were the students from Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) (ACS (I)). The first, second and third runners-up were the students from Raffles Institution (RI), Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) and Temasek Junior College (TJC) respectively. All the teams comprised 15-year-old Secondary Three students. Any one of the finalists could have won – or been eliminated – thanks to the competition’s hands-on interdisciplinary focus, which demanded quick thinking and resourcefulness. ACS (I) member Emmanuel Soon recalled the team sacrificing weekends and after-school hours to develop a prototype for a solar dryer using limited materials. As team member Ken Yokota Soh revealed, they diligently pored over videos and challenges from past competitions. Yet, unexpected twists, like the task of constructing ball-and-stick models of organic molecules from memory during the quarter finals, took them by surprise. “After the time was up, we had only built one model,” recounted team member Reyes Lee. To secure a spot in the grand finals, the ACS (I) team relied on the Wildcard Round, a crucial second chance. Said team member Aiden Lim: “It opened our eyes to the scope of the challenge and drove us to produce our best work and expand our scientific knowledge.” RGS, too, got a shot at redemption during the Wildcard Round. Teammates Claire-Leia Ng and Janhvi (who goes by one name) made a nerve-wracking dash to complete numerous tasks and questions on topics spanning zoology to programming in under one hour. The team’s elation upon learning of their advancement to the grand finals was palpable, as they realised that their efforts had finally borne fruit. COMMUNICATING STEM TO A WIDER AUDIENCE The NSTEMC placed a premium on strong collaborative and communication skills, ensuring that participants could convey their knowledge in easily understood presentations and responses. Judge Dr Aniq Ahsan, a scientist at the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology at A*STAR and technical advisor to the National Climate Change Secretariat at the Prime Minister’s Office, enjoyed the creative team presentations, which included start-up pitches, commercials and skits. Another judge, Dr Li Jingmei, group leader of the Laboratory of Women’s Health and Genetics at A*STAR, appreciated how teams crafted compelling narratives to bring scientific concepts and equations to life – some even incorporated aspects of Singapore’s history. Fellow judge Assistant Professor Yvonne Gao, Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore, agreed, noting the teams’ confidence and their ability to articulate strategies and scientific rationale. APPLYING STEM PRINCIPLES TO THE REAL WORLD During an Onsite Challenge visit to the National Kidney Foundation, the teams had a firsthand look at how STEM advancements improve patients’ lives. “The teams demonstrated a keen interest in learning and actively engaged with the experts and facilities they visited,” said judge Dr Lee Song Choon, director of KidsSTOP, Events and Engagement, at Science Centre Singapore: Indeed, the RI team said that the championship has inspired them to pursue STEM careers aimed at improving future standards of medical care and welfare. Addison Ang expressed his fascination with medical technology, while Harry Zhong Zihe noted that the study of medicine is a meaningful pursuit. Linus Ong hopes to explore precision medicine – which creates targeted, personalised treatment based on a patient’s data – while Swaagat Bikash Saikia is keen to explore natural language processing to create data-driven models that can address global community challenges. Judge Dr Felix Lena Stephanie, senior lecturer at the Nanyang Technological University’s School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said the annual NSTEMC is a celebration of innovation, creativity and collaboration among young minds. “Viewers should tune in, not just to see the impressive technical prowess on display, but to be inspired by our nation’s emerging STEM leaders. They turn academic theories into tangible solutions while navigating unexpected challenges. It’s not just a competition, but a testament to Singapore’s commitment to nurturing future-forward thinkers and innovators.” Catch the National STEM Championship 2023 on mewatch.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight For health sciences academics and spouses Chris Wong and Kaeling Tan, Macau provides opportunities to advance not only their careers but also their family life. Dr Kaeling Tan (left), senior instructor and operation manager of Genomics, Bioinformatics and Single Cell Core, Teaching and Biological Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau and Assoc Prof Chris Wong, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau, have worked in Macau for a decade. Photos: Kaeling Tan, Chris Wong For health sciences academics and spouses Chris Wong and Kaeling Tan, Macau provides opportunities to advance not only their careers but also their family life. A decade ago, spurred by a friend’s recommendation of the newly established Faculty of Health Sciences, biomedical researcher Chris Wong submitted his application to join the University of Macau. Following the interview, he extended the conversation with the faculty dean for over two hours. During this time, the latter shared a compelling overview of the university’s ambitions to build a world-class biomedical research institute and the raft of opportunities in Macau’s fast-developing health sciences sector. While Macau has a well-established presence in the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) arena , efforts are underway to diversify into other domains such as health tourism, translational medicine, medical innovation as well as research and development. A Hong Kong native who graduated from Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a Diploma in Biotechnology, Assoc Prof Wong, 44, has lived in both Australia – where he received his Bachelor and PhD degrees from the University of Melbourne’s Department of Genetics – and Boston in the United States, where he became a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School in 2008. Like Assoc Prof Wong, his Singaporean girlfriend-turned-wife, Dr Kaeling Tan, had completed her Diploma in Biotechnology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and her Bachelor and PhD degrees at the same institution and department in Australia before the couple’s time in Boston, where she was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School’s Department of Cell Biology. “After five years in Boston, we thought it was time to explore more permanent positions in our careers closer to home,” said Dr Tan, 43, senior instructor and operation manager of Genomics, Bioinformatics and Single Cell Core, Teaching and Biological Research at the University of Macau’s Faculty of Health Sciences. BUILDING CAREERS IN A DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT At the University of Macau, Assoc Prof Wong adeptly juggles teaching commitments with research focused on transcription gene regulation in fungi. This area of study holds promising potential for applications such as antifungal therapy and drug development. In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Dr Tan serves as an operations manager at the faculty’s core facility, where she contributes to research initiatives and mentors students and research assistants. Originally trained in research, Dr Tan did not have the opportunity to delve much into the education side of health sciences. Now, she designs and executes education programmes for post-graduates, undergraduates and occasionally even high school students. “I find satisfaction in staying current through research and nurturing the growth of the younger generation,” she shared. Today, Assoc Prof Wong and Dr Tan derive fulfilment from observing the swift development of Macau’s health sciences sector. Once pioneers at the university, they will soon be joined by peers from across the globe. The Macau government launched the Talent Recruitment System in July 2023 which invites exceptional professional talents to contribute their expertise and networks to the advancement of four key sectors: Health, technology, finance as well as culture and sports. The Talent Recruitment System comprises three categories . The High-end Talents Programme focuses on individuals with globally recognised achievements, skills or contributions, who can contribute to Macau’s long-term economic and social development. The Outstanding Talents Programme is designed for individuals possessing the experience and technical skills essential for facilitating Macau’s economic diversification. The Advanced Professionals Programme caters to individuals with expertise and skills identified as being in short supply within the four key sectors. “A new hospital is set to be established at Cotai and the Macau University of Science and Technology has recently inaugurated a new medical school. With the increasing demand for doctors and professionals from diverse backgrounds to train students, there are flourishing prospects for talents in Macau,” said Assoc Prof Wong, who added that funding opportunities for health sciences professionals in Macau are ample as a result of the city’s robust economic performance. In the dynamic landscape of Macau’s research arena, there remains untapped potential waiting to be explored. “The future holds much promise for translational research and applied medicine, and Macau is poised to witness a surge in the demand for expertise in these domains,” said Dr Tan. BALANCING WORK AND FAMILY WITH EASE While the chance to contribute to the development of a new university faculty and the proximity to Singapore and Hong Kong were defining factors for Dr Tan and Assoc Prof Wong, the couple also found that Macau provides a well-balanced work-life environment, allowing them quality time with their three young children, all of whom were born in the city. Macau’s family-friendly policies include financial incentives such as a birth allowance and cash handout of 10,000 Macanese pataca (S$1,670), medical care subsidies, as well as a range of extracurricular and government-organised activities designed to encourage parent-child bonding. Furthermore, young residents in Macau benefit from 15 years of free education spanning early childhood education to high school, or tuition fee subsidies if they choose to enrol in schools that do not offer free education. Additionally, all students engaged in formal education are entitled to textbook allowances. In 2020, the Macau government expanded its youth policy to encompass individuals aged 13 to 35, an extension from the previous age range of 13 to 29. Formulated through collaboration with the public, schools and civil society, the Macau Youth Policy 2021-2030 outlines action plans designed to cultivate youth, enhance their integration into regional and national development, and instil a heightened sense of responsibility. Dr Tan appreciates Macau’s family-oriented ethos that promotes a harmonious work-life equilibrium. “Along with support from our parents, I can better manage my career and family responsibilities,” he said. Assoc Prof Wong concurs, sharing: “I cherish the bandwidth to engage in meaningful conversations with my children. Our family enjoys plenty of leisurely time together in Macau, whether at home, purchasing groceries or visiting the park.” Learn more about living and working in Macau .

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight GrabFood helps ensure your budget goes the distance, whether you’re gearing up for a night out or opting for a cozy evening at home. Photos: Grab The app’s new features serve up both convenience and value, whether you’re looking to dine in or take out. Have you noticed that prices are creeping up – and that your wallet is taking a hit? From transport and daily essentials to dining out, the cost of living is steadily rising, leaving both consumers and businesses feeling the pinch. With food being a significant household expenditure in Singapore, Grab is taking a proactive approach to ease your financial burden without compromising your food cravings. This includes reducing delivery fees and presenting value-for-money dine-in deals, all aimed at making daily life a bit more affordable. “As an everyday superapp, it’s important that we find ways to create lower-priced services for consumers who want to be more prudent with their spending while still enjoying the convenience of on-demand services,” said Mr Tay Chuen Jein, head of deliveries at Grab Singapore. Whether you’re gearing up for a night out or opting for a cosy evening at home, here are five ways GrabFood is making sure your budget goes the distance. #1 SMART MEAL SCHEDULING = SAVVY SAVINGS Thanks to Grab’s Saver Delivery option, which offers reduced fees in exchange for a slightly extended delivery timeframe, you can unlock savings just by ordering your meals in advance. The best part: You can still savour your meal exactly when you want it because it’s all about smart planning. Made possible by a process called hyper-batching, the platform leverages artificial intelligence to identify, group and order the sequence of multiple deliveries along overlapping routes, while taking into account real-time factors such as traffic and weather conditions. “Our technology allows us to assign orders with similar delivery routes to one delivery partner. This means multiple consumers are sharing the cost of delivery and each gets to pay a little less,” Mr Tay explained. This nifty feature has saved foodies in Singapore over US$7 million (S$9.4 million) in delivery fees in just eight months. At the same time, delivery partners can boost earnings by completing more orders with less time and effort, making it a win-win situation for everyone. #2 THE MORE, THE MERRIER (AND CHEAPER) As communal gatherings become a regular part of our day-to-day life once more, GrabFood’s updated Group Order feature is a gamechanger, enabling users to enjoy both convenience and cost savings. Participating in a Group Order is a breeze – simply send an invitation link or scan a QR code and add your orders to a shared cart. Group Order can also be used with Mix-and-Match, a feature that lets consumers order from a variety of merchants located in a similar area. That way, there’s something for everyone in the group. Even settling the bill afterwards is effortlessly managed through the app’s smart bill calculation feature. It automatically computes each person’s share, ensuring a fair split that includes delivery fee, taxes and tips evenly distributed among all participants. According to Mr Tay, Group Order is especially popular for snacks like bubble tea, where meeting a minimum spend often requires pooling several orders. “This function also helps reduce the hassle involved in consolidating orders that allow for customisation, such as adjusting sugar levels and toppings in bubble tea,” he added. #3 DINE OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO SPLASH OUT In a city bursting with culinary options, it can be hard to decide where to dine. Fortunately, bargain-seekers can now look to GrabFood’s Dine-In feature for inspiration. This treasure trove of exclusive restaurant perks is designed to help users explore new gastronomic experiences without denting the wallet. With just a few taps, you can browse nearby deals, read restaurant reviews, pre-purchase dine-in vouchers and even book a ride to your chosen restaurant. Imagine satisfying your sushi cravings at Maki-San with a generous 30 per cent discount on a cash voucher or indulging in delectable Chinese New Year sets at Soup Restaurant at a 30 per cent discount. Said Mr Tay: “We work with merchant partners to create value-for-money meals and deals, allowing consumers to save while enjoying a restaurant dining experience. Notably, 35 per cent of dine-in users have either never used GrabFood before or have not done so in the past three months. This shows that we’re reaching a previously underserved group.” #4 UNLOCK MORE SAVINGS WITH A SUBSCRIPTION PLAN If GrabFood is a staple in your meal routine, then GrabUnlimited is the perfect choice for the cost-conscious, convenience-loving Singaporean. For a monthly fee of S$5.99, this subscription plan opens the door to exclusive deals spanning across some 1,000 merchants on the app. Perfect for family dinners or social gatherings, large food orders come with the added perk of up to S$10 off the delivery fee. Beyond the realm of food, GrabUnlimited lets subscribers enjoy 10 per cent off GrabCar Premium. Even your quick grocery runs via GrabMart are more economical, with up to S$3 off delivery fees. #5 BROWSE THE BEST DEALS UNDER ONE ROOF To offer users even more bang for their buck, GrabFood recently unveiled a Meals Under S$7 landing page on the app. Here, you can easily discover GrabFood’s best deals, complete with customisable filters for price points and delivery budgets as well as current promotions to help you make the most of this feature. “As Grab continues to grow, our focus on affordability aligns with our mission to drive Southeast Asia forward by making our services more accessible for local communities. Through our offerings, we create more value for consumers to use Grab in their everyday lives. We’ll continue to find unique ways to better serve foodies in Singapore in a sustainable manner,” said Mr Tay. For irresistible food deals, download the Grab app today.

Nestled in the heart of Raffles Place, Social Bar & Bistro boasts a wide variety of Asian and Western dishes. Photo: Social Bar & Bistro This audio is AI-generated. Whether you’re looking to cultivate healthier eating habits or rekindle connections with friends, the business district mall is brimming with options. The new year brings with it an inspired gumption to fulfil some resolutions, be it catching up on overdue social outings or embracing healthier dining choices for better well-being. Admittedly, this can be challenging, especially for the working posse navigating limited options within the confines of office hours. Fortunately, a convenient destination tailored to meet these aspirations is within reach. Just a short walk from Raffles Place MRT, Republic Plaza has emerged as a go-to destination for diners in the Central Business District, boasting an impressive array of over 25 food establishments. The diverse range of tenants not only enhances the excitement but also offers a variety of mouthwatering dishes for those seeking to satiate their new year goals.

Meanwhile, Social Bar & Bistro, true to its name, has designed its business around fostering social connections. With intelligently designed spaces catering to various gatherings, this plush eatery boasts an international all-day dining menu to satisfy every craving.

IF YOU WANT TO EAT HEALTHIER Taking small steps towards a healthier approach to dining is more manageable than jumping on a strict diet. At Republic Plaza, The Herbal Bar and Tangled (Fresh Pasta To Go) are your allies in your quest for nutritious and satisfying meals. Drawing inspiration from the timeless wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine and armed with recipes passed down through generations, The Herbal Bar boasts a menu that celebrates wholesome goodness. Its soups are nourishing options, with items such as Detox Kelp Soup and Mini Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. The bento selections shine with natural flavours, prepared with reduced salt, sugar and oil – no MSG in sight. You can also choose mixed grain rice, which adds fibre and ensures a lower glycemic index. Now, for a fun fact: Did you know that fresh pasta boasts fewer carbohydrates than its dried counterpart? Tangled (Fresh Pasta To Go) makes its own fresh pasta with semolina flour daily and takes pride in creating dishes with all-natural ingredients, free from colouring or preservatives. The casual eatery offers a refreshing take on traditional recipes, too. The Pinky Promise is a pretty plate, with beetroot pasta drenched in a creamy mentaiko sauce with salmon. Taking the tropical cue is Mango Tango, where squid ink spaghetti goes aglio e olio, served with prawns and mango salsa. IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE ON YOUR SELF-CARE In the hustle of everyday life, don’t forget to take a breather. Studies show that having some time out during the day is not only essential for your long-term well-being, but also boosts your productivity. Make a conscious effort to include a daily coffee break in your schedule and head over to Gloria Jean’s Coffees for some respite. Use this time to do the things you love, whether it’s catching up on a compelling drama series, reading another chapter on your e-reader, or simply unwinding and people-watching. Enhance your respite with Gloria Jean’s Coffees’ signature drinks. The Creme Brulee Espresso Chiller is a smooth creamy sip with caramel, while the Voltage Espresso Chiller provides an extra kick with its blend of vanilla and espresso beans, crowned with shots of hot espresso. When you’re all powered up, return to the office ready and refreshed. Elevate the rewards of your resolutions at Republic Plaza from Mar 11 to Apr 12. With a minimum spend of S$50, receive a complimentary S$5 CDL e-voucher to enhance your next visit.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Shopee aims to deliver a seamless and reliable experience from order placement to fulfilment. Parcels being sorted at one of SPX Express’ sorting centres. Photos: Shopee This audio is AI-generated. Shopee aims to deliver a seamless and reliable experience from order placement to fulfilment. Last September, as the weather grew increasingly hazy, Mr Gerald Lim, a computer programmer, knew he had to act quickly to find a solution. “My child, who is sensitive to airborne particles, was struggling with persistent sniffles,” he explained. “I urgently needed an air purifier to improve indoor air quality, especially on days when the environment turned less favourable.” Browsing the assortment of vouchers and promotions on the Shopee mobile app, Mr Lim discovered the guaranteed next-day delivery (NDD) option. “Thanks to the NDD service, the air purifier arrived at my doorstep the following day,” he said. Mr Kel Jin Chua, director of Shopee Singapore, highlighted that the introduction of NDD last August reflects the company’s commitment to enhancing customer experience and meeting the growing demand for expedited delivery options. “Shopee is focused on delivering effective solutions for pressing needs, such as securing a last-minute gift or replacing a faulty mobile phone,” said Mr Chua. HOW NEXT-DAY DELIVERY WORKS Since the launch of the service, Shopee has been working with logistics partner, SPX Express, to ensure the swift delivery of orders when customers opt for NDD as their delivery method. At SPX, a round-the-clock process facilitating NDD begins in the late afternoon and continues till nightfall. During this time, drivers collect parcels from sellers and transport them to SPX’s sorting centres where they are sorted overnight by specialised machines. Parcels are scanned at each stage of the journey for accurate record keeping. For instance, upon reaching the sorting centre, they undergo both weighing and scanning procedures. Post-sorting, parcels are grouped by delivery areas and matched with their respective delivery bag or pallet. Thereafter, they are moved to delivery hubs across Singapore. Drivers load parcels into vans and embark on their delivery routes by 8am. From meticulous sorting to the precise coordination of delivery routes, each step is designed to ensure the timely arrival of customers’ orders. COLLECTION POINTS FOR CONVENIENCE In addition to NDD, Shopee provides access to 2,000 collection points located throughout Singapore, including minimarts, mobile phone stores, opticians, lockers and shopping malls. This option is ideal for customers who anticipate being unavailable to receive their deliveries at home. Structured to prioritise ease, most Shopee users will be able to find a collection point within a five-minute walk from their home or workplace. The most popular collection points serve over 300 Shopee customers daily and the number is set to rise. Mr Lim often uses the Shopee collection point at a nearby convenience store when buying small items. “Since I’m not always at home, picking up my purchases on my way back from work is really convenient,” he said. To optimise his limited time at home on weekends, Mr Ravi Singh, a full-time national serviceman, purchases necessities like toiletries and household goods on Shopee once or twice a week. He, too, has reaped benefits from using the Shopee collection point service: “Shipping costs quickly add up when I buy items from multiple sellers, so it helps that delivery to collection points is free.” Mr Singh retrieves his parcels from the convenience store located beneath his block. “Not only is the process hassle-free, I also have peace of mind knowing that my purchases are securely stored at the shop,” he added. RECEIVE YOUR 4.4 HAUL IN A JIFFY At major shopping events such as the 4.4 sale , users can anticipate an expanding array of products eligible for NDD. Amid the bustling excitement, shoppers can rest assured that Shopee remains dedicated to delivering orders promptly. Said Mr Chua: “At Shopee, we place shoppers at the heart of all we do. Based on feedback obtained through Shopee chat and emails, we consistently adapt our features and services to meet evolving needs and provide users with an enjoyable online shopping experience.” Select Shopee’s guaranteed next-day delivery option when making a purchase and enjoy the platform’s exceptional service and convenience throughout your online shopping journey.

Prof George Siemens, an expert on artificial intelligence, shares insights on its impact on learning at the CBExchange APAC Conference 2024. Photos: Singapore Institute of Technology This audio is AI-generated. In the age of artificial intelligence, the Singapore Institute of Technology is harnessing its potential to reshape education through a competency-based approach. “In the realm of education, artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a tool,” said Professor George Siemens, chief scientist of Southern New Hampshire University’s Human Systems – an organisation that builds resources to respond to the systemic impact of AI on learning and wellness. “It is a thinking partner, one that changes our cognition.” Recognised for his pioneering work on how technology influences education, Prof Siemens was speaking at the recent CBExchange APAC 2024 in Singapore. Organised by the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) in partnership with the Competency-Based Education Network , the conference gathered thought leaders to explore the evolving landscape of education in the digital age. Indeed, AI is not just transforming industries but also recalibrating the labour market and precipitating a shift in core competencies. This rapid evolution presents a challenge for the education sector in bridging the widening gap between the skills of today’s workforce and those required by the job market. The solution, according to Prof Siemens, lies in embracing a new educational approach, one increasingly recognised as vital in our AI-driven era: Competency-based education. A NEW PARADIGM OF LEARNING In competency-based education, mastering skills and knowledge isn’t just about what you know but how well you apply it. In today’s dynamic job market, characterised by rapid technological advancements, this educational framework proves both agile and responsive. Addressing a pressing concern in modern education, Prof Siemens underscored the challenge universities face in assessing the authenticity of student performance. “With AI’s ability to generate assignments, how do we accurately assess student capabilities?” he said. Competency-based education offers a compelling solution by shifting the focus to practical skill application rather than mere acquisition. Within this framework, proficiency in utilising AI itself becomes a competency that students will have to master in order to achieve their learning goals effectively. Moreover, this educational approach is designed to align educational outcomes with the evolving demands of the job market. By leveraging AI’s capabilities, curriculum development can be tailored to match real-world workforce requirements. This backward-design methodology ensures that educational pathways directly address the skills gap, enhancing graduates’ employability. During her presentation at CBExchange APAC 2024, Associate Professor May Lim, assistant provost (Applied Learning) at SIT, shared how competency-based education and stackable micro-credentials revolutionise learning. “With the help of AI and big data, we can quickly gather industry insights, enabling educational institutions to refine their offerings to equip students with the relevant skills to meet tomorrow’s challenges,” she said. EMPOWERING ADULT LEARNERS THROUGH AI SIT spearheaded the competency-based education model last year with the launch of its Applied Computing degree programme . Alongside, it introduced stackable micro-credentials and recognition of prior learning as key components of its adult education offerings. Assoc Prof Lim said: “As a forward-looking university, it’s crucial that we embrace change and offer flexible and accessible education pathways. This is vital for adult learners juggling multiple commitments while pursuing further education.” The integration of AI’s adaptive learning technologies provides opportunities for highly personalised education, allowing content delivery that can be adapted to each learner’s pace and preferences. It also broadens the spectrum of assessment methods while ensuring comprehensive feedback. Assoc Prof Lim explained: “AI tutors can transform the feedback process by offering multifaceted perspectives, unlike the traditional method that relies on a single source.” A unique challenge encountered by students pursuing stackable micro-credentials is the asynchronous nature of the lessons, which allows for self-paced learning. “While independent learning offers flexibility, we recognise the value of collaborative learning. This is where AI peers can come into play alongside human peers with different schedules. This can make the learning process more interactive and supportive while accommodating the hectic schedules of adult learners,” she elaborated. NAVIGATING ETHICAL FRONTIERS WITH INTEGRITY As educators explore the vast potential of AI, ethical considerations remain paramount. Stressing the necessity for openness and clarity in AI-related processes, Assoc Prof Lim said: “Ensuring transparency in how data is utilised is fundamental for building trust between students and educational institutions.” Expanding on this ethical imperative, Prof Siemens added: “Every phase – from data collection and model building to deployment and assessment – demands meticulous attention to safety, equity and ethics. It is critical that technological advancements contribute to a learning environment that is both fair and secure.” Looking ahead, Prof Siemens envisions AI as a catalyst for deeper inquiry into the human condition. “We’re at a crossroads, questioning what it means to be human in a technology-driven world,” he mused. “The hope is that AI will guide us in asking the right questions about human identity – and in so doing, elevate our understanding and enrich the human experience.” Learners who are keen to upskill themselves can discover the array of courses offered by the Singapore Institute of Technology .

Attending courses on data analytics, data visualisation and Python programming boosted his confidence and gave him an edge over other job applicants, said Mr Ng Zhi Hao Matchy. Photos: NTUC LearningHub This audio is AI-generated. For these three go-getters, reskilling was their first move into tech-empowered roles. A tech-related tip on boosting efficiency led Mr Ng Zhi Hao Matchy to embark on a tech-oriented learning journey of his own – with the goal of advancing his career within the field of human resources (HR). At the time, he was a HR executive in the manufacturing industry, handling tasks like payroll, absentee processing, expatriate management and data entry. “A colleague from the IT department shared how macros – a recorded sequence of commands – could do the same work but with greater speed and efficiency,” recounted the 40-year-old. “I decided to explore using macros and created a program to carry out my daily tasks, which my colleagues found useful as well.” This experience fuelled Mr Ng’s aspiration to become a HR information systems (HRIS) specialist, dedicated to leveraging technology for the automation and optimisation of HR-related operational functions. In pursuit of this objective, he enrolled in data analytics, data visualisation and Python programming courses at NTUC LearningHub , a continuing education and training provider in Singapore. NTUC LearningHub’s technology courses are delivered in collaboration with over 50 best-in-class content providers, ensuring their workplace relevance. The training provider has also partnered the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA) to expand the national reskilling and upskilling initiatives in the domains of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, analytics, software engineering, and cloud and mobility. BOOSTING HIS CAREER GROWTH WITH SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE Now an HRIS consultant in the financial services sector, Mr Ng said that his enhanced proficiency in data analytics and programming has empowered him to devise more efficient processes and methodologies at work. While he had been exposed to big data at his former workplace, he felt that a more structured learning approach deepened his understanding of data analytics and Python programming, compared to ad-hoc learning on the job or self-study. “Attending these courses not only boosted my confidence in specific skill sets but gave me an edge over other job applicants. I also find that employers have more confidence in you when you have certifications from trusted continuing education and training providers like NTUC LearningHub.” Mr Ng hopes to pursue a tech-centric master’s degree in the future, with the goal of becoming an HRIS director. Until then, he remains committed to acquiring competencies that will help shape his career. “With perseverance and continuous learning, you will become an expert who can put your learning to good use and achieve your goals,” he said. REINVENTING HIS PROFESSIONAL PATH AFTER RETRENCHMENT The pandemic-induced downturn cost Mr Airul Qaiz Matthew his role as a project coordinator in the construction sector – but this event ended up being a catalyst for his career transformation. “Being retrenched was a devastating loss,” he said candidly. “But I realised that everything happens for a reason. If I hadn’t lost my job, I would never have come to the epiphany that the job industry is changing, and I needed to reskill myself. Instead of being reactive, I had to become proactive.” Recognising the dynamic growth within the field and the multitude of opportunities it presented, Mr Airul, who is in his 30s, decided to pivot into the tech sector. To gain the necessary skills, he enrolled in NTUC LearningHub’s SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme (SCTP) Cybersecurity Associate course. He was not dissuaded by the fact that the last time he learnt anything related to technology was during secondary school. He admitted: “I even struggled with basic operations in Microsoft Office. But over time, the classes and the internship component of NTUC LearningHub’s SCTP programme taught me many skills, and the terminology and concepts became more familiar.” His determination paid off. After mastering the requisite skill sets, Mr Airul secured a job as a cybersecurity administrator in the aviation industry, where he conducts risks assessments of systems and performs monthly log reviews. “At work, I use skills related to Structured Query Language (SQL) and data interpretation that I picked up during the course,” he shared. “The course also provided a foundation for my continuous learning journey. This includes pursuing certifications such as the Certified in the Governance of Enterprise IT, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Certified Information Systems Security Professional qualifications.” Mr Airul advises others contemplating career transitions to seize every opportunity to reskill and upgrade themselves. Courses and certifications like those offered at NTUC LearningHub can help to boost employability and enable career advancement. “Knowledge is power,” he reflected. “Most companies today no longer look for those with ‘X’ years of experience – they want to know what skills and certifications you have. We need to constantly improve ourselves to remain employable.” FLOURISHING WITH THE HELP OF NEW COMPETENCIES, AFTER UNEMPLOYMENT Despite holding a degree in mechanical engineering with a specialisation in aeronautical engineering, Ms Noor Mustikha Noor Khalid, 26, found the doors to the aviation industry shut, no thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic. With prolonged unemployment taking its toll, she took on a job as a management associate in the social service sector, though she knew the role was not the best fit for her. A turning point came when she learnt about NTUC LearningHub’s SCTP Associate Data Analyst programme, while scrolling through Instagram. Ms Mustikha, who was already interested in the integration of engineering and technology, saw the programme as an ideal opportunity to acquire the skills necessary to join the tech industry. The programme’s blend of theoretical knowledge and hands-on application further appealed to her. “Without the avenue to demonstrate the skills we’ve learnt, certificates are just paper qualifications,” she reasoned. “SCTP offered the competencies for upskilling and included capstone projects to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and Python.” Ms Mustikha’s capstone projects also made for impressive additions to her portfolio during the job hunt. With tangible proof of her competencies and experience, she was able to secure her current role as a data and knowledge management executive in the education industry. She leverages software tools like Power BI, a skill she acquired during her course, to perform tasks such as managing, analysing and visualising data at work. Looking forward, she envisions expanding her skill set in domains such as data analytics and robotic process automation. To sceptics of lifelong learning, she uses the analogy of a smartphone: “Your phone software and apps require regular updates to fix bugs, and these updates protect your phone from malicious vulnerabilities in data privacy and security. Similarly, lifelong learning bridges gaps in skill sets and competencies, and strengthens your personal well-being and your relevance in employment.” Reflecting on her experience, Ms Mustikha noted that lacking relevant skills made it difficult for her to pursue a tech-related job. Choosing to upskill at NTUC LearningHub was the crucial factor enabling her to overcome this barrier: “The programme equipped me with the essential skill sets required in the tech field, effectively facilitating my successful transition from the social service sector to a tech-focused role.” Take the first step towards a career switch by learning more about upskilling at NTUC LearningHub .

Before beginning treatment, clients at BMF undergo a comprehensive skin analysis. Photos: BMF, Svenson Hair Center. This audio is AI-generated. Experts share more about aesthetic solutions from BMF – The Aesthetics People and Svenson Hair Center that blend innovative technologies with holistic care. Fuelled by the pervasive influence of social media and celebrity culture, the quest for physical perfection, from flawless skin to glossy hair, has become increasingly common. While some beauty treatments can be invasive and may not suit everyone, homegrown brand, BMF – The Aesthetics People offers holistic solutions aimed at enhancing one’s natural beauty. “Our objective is to establish a safe and empowering space for clients to engage in curated regimens that are grounded in technology,” shared Ms Louisa Leow, senior strategic manager at Global Beauty International, the parent company of BMF and its sister brand Svenson Hair Center . BMF customises its solutions to each client’s requirements, addressing issues ranging from skin and ageing-related concerns to body contouring and weight management. Prior to treatment, clients undergo consultations involving thorough physical analyses, to ensure precise recommendations for optimal results. Ms Leow highlighted that while aesthetic treatments are integral to BMF’s approach, they are not the sole focus. “Our offerings prioritise overall well-being and include wellness consultations, nutritional guidance and lifestyle recommendations,” she shared. A SPOTLIGHT ON COLLAGEN BMF’s signature skin and body solutions are centred around boosting collagen production. According to Ms Cherie Mah, Global Beauty International’s strategic and creative manager, this emphasis stems from collagen’s critical role in preserving skin health, firmness and elasticity. One standout service at BMF is the Centreless Focused Ultrasound (CFU) Ultima by Elife Treatment. The approach combines high-intensity focused ultrasound and thermal technology, utilising cutting-edge Italian equipment to achieve collagen synthesis deep within the skin. Currently, BMF is one of the select beauty centres in Singapore certified to operate CFU machines. “After one session, clients can anticipate benefits such as plumped up and smoother skin as well as a sculpted visage*,” said Ms Mah. “The treatment involves minimal discomfort and requires no downtime, with its skin-enhancing effects persisting over two weeks to a month.” While the CFU Ultima by Elife Treatment helps one achieve a fresher appearance, Ms Mah recommends the Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA) Collagen Treatment as an anti-ageing complement. “The treatment’s active ingredient, PLLA, possesses collagen-stimulating properties and its slow degradation aids in collagen production over an extended period,” she said. The treatment synergises PLLA application with fractional monopolar radiofrequency technology, facilitating deep dermal rejuvenation and lymphatic drainage. Ms Mah underscored PLLA’s hygroscopic nature, which enhances skin hydration by attracting and retaining moisture. She added that while skin appears more radiant after the first session, regular bi-monthly treatments can aid in reducing visible signs of ageing*. Alongside facial treatments, Ms Leow shared that maintaining optimal skin health entails the daily application of a high-SPF broad-spectrum sunscreen, getting sufficient sleep and staying hydrated. NURTURE YOUR CROWNING GLORY Svenson Hair Center is committed to addressing diverse hair-related concerns among Singaporeans, including those influenced by environmental, nutritional and lifestyle factors. Its hair treatments combine the principles of trichology and hair science to effectively target hair and scalp issues. These treatments are administered by a team of in-house trichologists, hair consultants and therapists, renowned for their rigorous training and certified expertise. Svenson Hair Center’s Quick Turn Around (QTA) treatment is a signature offering, tailored to enhance hair and scalp health through innovative hydrogen technology, the moisturising benefits of hyaluronic acid and a thorough 15-step scalp massage. During the hydrogen water treatment, an ozone mist is produced to purify the scalp and inhibit the buildup of debris and bacteria at the hair follicles, mitigating issues such as scalp acne and itching. Thereafter, a hyaluronic acid infusion deeply hydrates the scalp, promoting collagen production to counteract scalp ageing as well as alleviate flakiness and dryness. Ms Kim Fong, group chief trichologist at Svenson Hair Center, shared that customers can observe visible results after the session through a hair scan to examine the condition of their hair follicles and scalp. She noted that lifestyle adjustments such as stress management, avoiding tight hairstyles and eating a balanced diet can also help improve hair health. “Maintaining a diet rich in essential vitamins and minerals sourced from green and purple foods, beta-glucan fibres, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids, is particularly beneficial.” said Ms Fong. THE FUTURE OF BEAUTY BEGINS HERE ROADSHOW The Future of Beauty Begins Here roadshow, spotlighting solutions from BMF and Svenson Hair Center, will be held at the Jurong Point atrium from Apr 8 to Apr 14.

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Bioskin's Master Contour Face Treatment aims to lift cheeks, soften fine lines and refine the jawline. Photos: Bioskin This audio is AI-generated. An expert from Bioskin shares why specialised beauty treatments can help elevate not just physical appearance but also mental well-being. In Singapore, many are familiar with its dynamic, fast-paced lifestyle. Amid the hustle and bustle, a growing number of individuals are turning to beauty treatments as a means of finding solace and revitalisation. “We’ve observed an uptick in people investing in skincare not just to boost their outward appearance but also to cultivate positive emotions,” said Ms Chanel Tay, assistant training manager at Bioskin , an established beauty salon in Singapore. Customers, she noted, are no longer simply seeking physical rejuvenation; they’re also craving moments of tranquility within their hectic lives. “This shift reflects a growing recognition of the link between physical appearance and emotional health. As a result, there’s a rising demand for beauty treatments that foster emotional rejuvenation and support overall wellness,” Ms Tay said. FEELING GOOD, FROM THE INSIDE OUT While consumers are gradually embracing beauty treatments as a pathway to holistic well-being, Bioskin has been a champion of this approach for the past 28 years, guided by the ethos that “skin care is self-care”. “Our philosophy is centred on results-driven, non-invasive treatments that prioritise the overall well-being of our customers,” said Ms Tay. One example is its Master Contour Face Treatment, which combines Bioskin ’ s signature multi-lift face sculpting technique and gold collagen thread lift to lift cheeks, soften fine lines and refine the jawline. “The treatment involves stimulating acupuncture points to promote blood circulation and cell regeneration,” Ms Tay explained. “Our technique targets four key facial acupressure points: The chengjiang point, dicang point, yingxiang point and zygomatic point. These points correspond to areas prone to sagging, notably around the cheeks, chin and sides of the nose.” By stimulating these acupressure points through an invigorating massage, the skin ’ s natural healing mechanism is activated, said Ms Tay. This promotes an uplifting effect while facilitating lymphatic drainage to reduce facial puffiness and accentuate jawline definition. Complementing this process is a needle-free gold collagen thread lift, which delivers a potent collagen serum deep into the skin. Ms Tay explained that this step encourages collagen remodelling to plump up the skin and refine its texture. Ms Tay added that the treatment can release tension and stagnant energy. “Think of the Master Contour Face Treatment as a rejuvenating gym or yoga session for your face,” she said. “It revitalises the skin, leaving it livelier, healthier and firmer.” EASING THE PRESSURES OF THE DAILY GRIND Similar to the Master Contour Face Treatment, Bioskin ’ s newly improved Herbal Scalp Treatment 2.0 makes use of targeted acupoint massages to improve scalp health and elevate overall well-being. The treatment involves dispensing a herbal concoction in a waterfall-like motion, ensuring optimal absorption into the scalp. Key ingredients in the herbal blend include ai cao (Chinese mugwort) and zang hong hua (saffron), which work together to improve blood circulation and alleviate body aches, Ms Tay shared. During the 1.5-hour session, the therapist employs a meticulous combing technique aligned with the flow of the scalp’s meridian lines. “The Herbal Scalp Treatment 2.0 not only eases physical discomfort but also promotes energy flow in the body,” said Ms Tay. “It is especially beneficial for individuals experiencing the consequences of prolonged sitting, excessive gadget use and being exposed to air-conditioning for long periods of time, which often lead to issues like poor blood circulation, headaches and stiff necks.” For clients dealing with scalp issues or stress-related discomfort, Ms Tay recommends regular sessions – at least once every two weeks initially, then monthly. Even without scalp concerns, this pampering treatment serves as the perfect antidote after a taxing week. While incorporating beauty treatments into your self-care routine offers numerous benefits, Ms Tay added that it is important to adjust your lifestyle, too. This involves taking steps to minimise stress and adopt healthy habits, such as mindful eating and regular exercise. Said Ms Tay: “By prioritising self-care, you are taking a proactive step towards holistic wellness.” New customers can try Bioskin’s Master Contour Facial Treatment or Herbal Scalp Treatment 2.0 at a special price of S$48* (before GST).

    "article_content": "Brand Spotlight Achieving clear, healthy skin involves adopting mindful lifestyle choices. Photos: Bioskin This audio is AI-generated. An expert from Bioskin sheds light on this common skin condition and its multifaceted causes. You’ve likely encountered these common beliefs: “Only teenagers get acne”, “Popping pimples gets rid of them more quickly” or “Acne is caused by eating too much chocolate and greasy food”. These notions often trivialise the complexities of acne and can be misleading, said Ms Chanel Tay, assistant training manager at Bioskin , an established beauty salon in Singapore. Acne, she explained, is primarily caused by factors such as excess oil production, clogged pores and bacteria. “While cleansing helps remove surface dirt and oil, acne can still occur due to factors like hormonal imbalances and genetics. Over-washing or harsh scrubbing can irritate the skin and exacerbate acne,” she added. Contrary to popular belief, acne affects individuals of all ages, including adults. “Hormonal changes, stress, diet and genetics can all contribute to acne development beyond the teenage years,” shared Ms Tay. “Hormonal acne is linked to the overproduction of sebum (an oily substance in skin glands), which clogs pores. Though often unavoidable, hormonal acne can be treated to prevent future breakouts.” For individuals genetically predisposed to acne, Ms Tay recommends taking a proactive approach to managing acne. This includes selecting non-comedogenic products that won't block pores or worsen breakouts, as well as scheduling regular facial treatments. As for popping or squeezing pimples, Ms Tay cautioned that this may worsen inflammation, increase the risk of scarring and spread bacteria, leading to more breakouts. “It’s best to leave pimples alone and allow them to heal naturally or seek professional treatment,” she advised. When it comes to diet choices playing a role in acne development, Ms Tay said that chocolate has been unfairly blamed as a trigger for acne, but there is limited evidence linking chocolate consumption directly to acne. Greasy foods themselves are also not the main culprit behind acne breakouts. According to Ms Tay, these foods are often eaten together with high-carbohydrate meals, which can trigger acne by promoting inflammation and influencing hormone levels. Consuming simple carbohydrates like refined grains and sugars can cause a rapid spike in insulin levels. The increase in insulin prompts higher levels of androgen hormones and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) in the bloodstream. Consequently, this hormonal surge accelerates skin cell growth and boosts sebum production, contributing to clogged pores and acne. MAKING INFORMED DECISIONS TO IMPROVE SKIN HEALTH For acne sufferers seeking a comprehensive treatment programme, Ms Tay recommends Bioskin’s Skin Purifying Face Treatment, which prioritises advanced technologies and specialised products over traditional extraction methods to tackle acne. “Our non-invasive approach includes using ultrasonic exfoliation to clear debris from the skin and draw out excess oils, whiteheads and blackheads, followed by a high-frequency device to kill germs and bacteria that cause inflammation,” Ms Tay explained. The key ingredient used in this 10-step treatment is professional-grade salicylic acid, which penetrates the skin to dissolve dead skin cells, regulate oil secretion and lighten blemishes. To address acne concerns effectively, Ms Tay emphasised the importance of examining the factors that contribute to acne development. “While we cannot alter our genetics or hormone levels, we can manage certain lifestyle choices that influence acne breakouts,” she said. “This includes maintaining good hygiene practices and adopting a balanced diet.” In addition, Ms Tay recommends establishing a comprehensive skincare routine that encompasses gentle cleansing, moisturising and the use of non-comedogenic acne treatments. Individuals should also prioritise adequate rest, regular exercise, proper hydration and effective stress management to boost overall skin health.

What’s more important – career stability or pursuing your passions, saving for a rainy day or investing in experiences? When parental advice and peer insights clash, can young Singaporeans strike a perfect balance? In the journey from graduation caps to office desks, young adults often find themselves at a crossroads, caught between the advice of their parents and the opinions of their peers. According to a Pew Research survey, nearly 70 per cent of youths turn to their parents for guidance on issues like career choices and financial management. Despite this, about 40 per cent of youths find themselves at odds with their parents’ views on these topics. In Singapore, younger generations are sometimes labelled entitled, overly individualistic and less resilient, while older generations are seen as conservative and stubbornly attached to their traditions. These differences span various topics, from career paths to personal spending . Can this apparent conflict in perspectives be reconciled? The following scenarios illustrate how Josh, a young adult in Singapore, navigates between his mother Jane’s time-tested advice and the views of his friend Blake. BALANCING JOB SECURITY AND CAREER FULFILMENT Fresh out of university, Josh finds himself at a pivotal decision point: Should he secure a full-time job in his field of study or follow his passion by pursuing freelance opportunities in the creative industry? Blake’s advice focuses on immediate satisfaction and personal growth, which may appeal to Josh’s aspirations for a dynamic career. On the other hand, Jane emphasises the value of consistent career progression and long-term security. While Josh feels that Blake is better informed about today’s economic opportunities and risks, he also knows that Jane’s pragmatism stems from years of experience in the workforce and genuine concern for his future. Addressing the generational differences in perspective, Mr Nicholas Gabriel Lim, head of Graduate Diploma in Youth Work and Professional Life Coaching Programmes at Singapore University of Social Sciences, said: “Parents like Jane aim to prepare their children for the future. But for young adults, it’s sometimes the present that matters because it influences how they are perceived and whether they feel a sense of connectedness with their peers.” As young adults are still exploring and defining their identities as part of their personal growth, having shared behavioural norms and values with peers is important to them . For example, if Josh takes up a 9-6 office job as his mother advises, he may feel left out and resentful when he sees his peers on social media pursuing unorthodox career choices, like freelancing in creative fields or becoming digital nomads. There is also the underlying fear that he may one day regret sacrificing his youth and the pursuit of his passion for the security of a stable career. As an adult in his early 20s, input from his peers and a sense of belonging are important to Josh. This often leads to tension when trying to balance his friends’ advice with his mother’s guidance. “The tension isn’t about whose influence is stronger or whose advice is right, as both can be equally valuable,” said Mr Lim. “The real struggle for Josh is making a well-rounded decision that he can truly call his own, without negatively impacting his relationships with his parent and friend.” Mr Lim suggests that Jane facilitate an open discussion, rather than impose her views. “By encouraging Josh to explore the different facets of his career choices, he can then take ownership of his decisions. This is vital for his independence and self-discovery during this critical period of personal and professional development.” THE QUEST FOR WORK-LIFE BALANCE Work-life balance is a top priority for young professionals , according to a 2022 survey by Deloitte. While Jane encourages Josh to work hard to get ahead in his career, Blake points out that earning a large salary and a promotion won’t make up for burnout. Josh must decide if he wants to hustle to maximise his earning potential, as Jane advises, or heed Blake’s words to prioritise self-care. While Josh appreciates Jane’s guidance, he often finds her warnings restrictive. He agrees with Blake that he doesn’t want to waste his youth overworking and not having enough time and energy to pursue his interests, such as hobbies or long-term travel. Although Josh knows Jane wants the best for him, family conversations about careers often make him feel like she is imposing her views on him. According to Mr Lim, young adults like Blake are likely guided in their decision-making by the part of the brain that is predominantly driven by emotions and relationships. Middle-aged individuals like Jane primarily use a brain region that assesses consequences and outcomes, making them more sensitive to the practical impact of decisions. However, Mr Lim emphasised that this doesn’t mean that young people are incapable of considering long-term consequences; rather, older adults may process these considerations more efficiently as their brains are more developed. To engage effectively, parents often need to adjust their communication styles and protective tendencies. When communicating with young adults like Blake and Josh, Jane can choose her words to be more empathetic and less didactic. Instead of questioning Josh’s work ethic with phrases like “Why don’t you want to work? Don’t be lazy”, which may provoke defensiveness, she can listen to his frustrations about his work. Then, drawing from her own experiences, she can offer suggestions to help him achieve a healthier work-life balance. Said Mr Lim: “Mentors should frame their guidance in ways that resonate emotionally, ensuring advice is not only practical but also meaningful. The key lies not just in what is said, but in how it is communicated and understood.” On Josh’s part, Mr Lim advocates for a balanced approach that combines youthful passion and seasoned wisdom to inform more comprehensive decision-making. “Young professionals should leverage the experience of trusted adults who can provide insights grounded in practicality and foresight,” he advised. DIFFERING ATTITUDES TOWARDS PERSONAL FINANCES Navigating financial advice can feel like balancing contrasting philosophies. For Josh, who has managed to save a decent amount, the dilemma now is whether to continue building his nest egg or take advantage of his youth and invest in enriching experiences like travel and higher-risk opportunities like cryptocurrencies . While he shares a similarly relaxed attitude to money as Blake, Josh is aware that Jane has sacrificed and saved for years to pay for his education and upkeep. He feels guilty and anxious about spending on things she considers frivolous – such as weekend trips or nights out – yet he can't bear missing out on these formative experiences with his friends. He oscillates between wanting to enjoy his youth without limits and worrying that his mother is right about his excessive spending on fun pursuits. According to Mr Lim, such disagreements are normal in a healthy parent-child relationship. “Young people are quite resilient and will fall back on that stable relationship and deep connection with their parents,” he explained. “The stronger the bond, the higher the likelihood that they can handle pushback or challenges to their views without harming the relationship.” Josh may occasionally come into conflict with Jane or Blake, but if his relationship with either worsens, he is unlikely to seek their advice on important issues in the future. This will shrink his circle of support at a time when he is grappling with major life decisions. Ultimately, it’s important to recognise that both parents and peers have the best interests of the young adult at heart – even if their views seem contradictory or communication styles differ. To foster better mutual understanding, Mr Lim advises Josh to see Jane’s cautious guidance as a valuable resource rather than merely restrictive. “Understanding the risks outlined by someone with a mature perspective can refine your decision-making process,” he explained. “You can integrate this practical advice with your personal values and lessons from your upbringing. This synthesis enables you to make informed choices that reflect both caution and passion. That’s the real benefit of having support from both generations – it broadens your understanding and enriches your decision-making framework.” Who do you turn to for advice and support, and how do you balance advice from different generations?

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Diesel fuel prices across most of Malaysia soared by more than 50 per cent, as the country slashed its diesel subsidies in West Malaysia on Monday (June 10) as part of a wider shift away from blanket subsidies. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Diesel fuel prices across most of Malaysia soared by more than 50 per cent, as the country slashed its diesel subsidies in West Malaysia on Monday (June 10) as part of a wider shift away from blanket subsidies. The move effectively aligned diesel rates with market prices, as pumps across the peninsula shot up from RM2.15 (S$0.61) to RM3.35 (S$0.96) a litre — a 56 per cent increase. Economists told TODAY that they foresee a moderate increase in the price of goods and services in Malaysia as a result of the reforms, though the wider impact on the country’s fiscal position is still unclear. As for prices of Malaysian goods imported into Singapore via its land border, they are expecting a “minimal” impact. Explaining the move last month, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that the cuts are part of his plan to focus aid for low-income groups in the country by restructuring its wide-ranging subsidies, which he argued had benefitted the ultra-rich since their consumption or spending on goods and services is greater. Fuel, rice and cooking oil, as well as other basic items, are heavily subsidised in Malaysia, which has seen its subsidy bill rise to record levels in recent years. The country’s diesel subsidies alone surged almost 10-fold from RM1.4 billion (S$400 million) in 2019 to RM14.3 billion (S$4.08 billion) in 2023. The diesel subsidy cuts are expected to bring about savings of RM4 billion, which will be channelled to fund public transport and cash aid, Mr Anwar said separately on Tuesday at the finance ministry’s monthly assembly. As part of a bid to restructure the country’s subsidy distribution system, the government had also announced the rationalisation of subsidies for electricity tariffs and sales of chicken last year, which are estimated to save RM4.5 billion and RM1.2 billion a year respectively. However, there are some exceptions to the removal of the diesel subsidies. In Sabah and Sarawak, where the use of diesel vehicles is widespread, the price of diesel will remain subsidised at RM2.15 a litre. Logistics vehicles under the government’s MySubsidi Diesel programme can also qualify for the subsidised diesel rate. Lower diesel prices have been set as well for fishermen and land public transport vehicles such as school buses and ambulances, the finance ministry said. Because of these continued subsidies under the MySubsidi Diesel scheme for commercial vehicles, Dr Cassey Lee, senior fellow and coordinator of the regional economic studies programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, expects just a “moderate increase” in the prices of goods in the country. The programme, which is targeted at logistics companies, provides the firms with fleet cards that allow them to continue buying subsidised diesel at fuel retail stations. The scheme aims to cushion some of the impact of fuel costs on supply chains and so safeguard consumers from extreme price increases. However, some increase — albeit a “moderate” one — in goods’ prices is still expected, experts said. In its monetary policy statement published on May 9, the Central Bank of Malaysia said that inflation in 2024 is expected to “remain moderate”, but the outlook for the rest of the year is dependent on the “implementation of domestic policy on subsidies and price controls”, as well as global commodity prices and financial market developments. Elaborating on this, Mr Suhaimi Ilias, chief economist at Maybank Investment Banking Group, said that the banking group expects the country’s inflation to average at 2.4 per cent this year, which is higher than the 1.7 per cent average for the first four months of the year. This implies that monthly inflation could pick up from June onwards and last for the rest of the year. On how the diesel subsidy reforms will translate to programmes for Malaysians, Dr Lee said that the reforms will “release some fiscal resources” for the federal government. The aim of redirecting what was previously spent on diesel subsidies to lower-income groups in Malaysia may also help these groups to weather inflation. It remains to be seen, though, how the overall fiscal position will change, or how significant is the aid for lower-income groups, since much depends on how the government spends the money, Dr Lee added. He noted: “For example, the Malaysian government has increased the salaries of civil servants by 13 per cent, costing RM10 billion annually. “This amount is close to savings from the diesel subsidy reforms. This suggests that the net change is near neutral from a fiscal point.” If executed well, Mr Suhaimi from Maybank said that the reforms would demonstrate the government’s political will to undertake unpopular but necessary policy reforms — especially from the perspectives of the financial market and international rating agencies. Conversely, a poor execution of the reforms could also lead to negative political implications. Dr Lee said: “If the diesel subsidy reforms result in the perception of increasing hardship and worsening economic performance, the popularity of the present government will decline. “This will also put the government on the defensive and it will have less appetite for future reforms such as the RON95 petrol subsidy reforms.” The experts said that they do not foresee the diesel subsidy reforms in Malaysia to affect the general prices of imported goods in Singapore significantly, but certain imported products from Malaysia might end up costing marginally more. Dr Lee of Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute expects the price increases of goods driven by trucks into Singapore to be “minimal”, reiterating that commercial vehicles can continue to buy subsidised diesel via the MySubsidi Diesel fleet card system. The move is not expected to have a “material impact” on Singapore’s overall inflation, another analyst said. Dr Chua Hak Bin, regional co-head of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group, noted however, that there may still be second-order effects on the prices of certain goods here. Some food items transported from Malaysia may see a small increase in prices, for example. However, as a contributory factor to food prices in Singapore,Dr Chua said that the cost of fuel used during transportation is not as significant compared to the overall costs of labour and vehicles, as well as taxes. As labour and rentals account for a big proportion of overall costs for food-serving services, the impact of the extra cost of transport on overall menu prices in Singapore will likely be small, he added.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — From July 1, SMSes from government agencies will come from a single sender ID known as gov.sg, instead of the individual organisations. The SMSes will be sent by gov.sg, with the respective agency's name spelt in full. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — From July 1, SMSes from government agencies will come from a single sender ID known as gov.sg, instead of the individual organisations. The move is aimed at helping the public identify authentic government SMSes and to guard against government official impersonation scams, said Smart Nation Group, Open Government Products (OGP) and the Ministry of Communications and Information in a joint media release on Thursday (June 13). Since January, at least 126 people have been cheated by scammers impersonating Chinese officials, with total losses amounting to at least S$16.3 million, according to an advisory by the police on Thursday. In the past, scammers have also impersonated police officers to convince victims to provide their personal details or transfer their money to third-party bank accounts. In the joint release on Thursday, the agencies said that SMS remains a key platform for government communications to the public, given the widespread use of mobile phones. More than 100 million SMSes are sent by various government agencies annually to notify recipients about policy changes and provide transaction updates, they added. Recipients can expect SMSes from gov.sg for updates from various government agencies such as the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. The type of messages the public may receive includes updates on personal CPF matters, transaction status and appointment details, HDB flat and loan eligibility, as well as reminders to renew identity cards and passports. However, some exceptions will be made for SMSes on National Service (NS) matters and emergency services. For example, messages on NS call-ups, training as well as mobilisation will be sent by the number \"72255\". Likewise, those who contact the police helpline will receive SMSes from \"71000\" for information on accessing the services they require. The single sender ID will be progressively rolled out from June 18. During this period until the complete roll-out on July 1, government agencies, ministries and statutory boards will continue to send SMSes from their respective sender IDs. Members of the public are advised to remain vigilant against scams while checking messages for the official gov.sg sender ID. The consolidated sender ID is designed to give the public \"added confidence and ease of mind\" when identifying legitimate SMSes from government agencies, said deputy secretary of Smart Nation Group Sim Feng-Ji. Speaking to the media, Mr Sim said the agency is working closely with SMS aggregators — platforms or services that help to send bulk messages — telecommunication service providers and their sub-brands to ensure that messages that are not from the government cannot use the gov.sg sender ID. Mr Hygin Fernandez, policy assistant director of OGP, told CNA that additional safeguards are also in place for the gov.sg sender ID. \"If anyone were to try and register a sender ID that looks even remotely like gov.sg, there are multiple layers (of protection), including a manual one where somebody eyeballs it, that prevents that message from ever being reaching the public,\" he said. Mr Hygin added that it took about nine months to plan and develop the sender ID. The main focus when designing was to make sure the average person on the street would understand what the new way of communication means for them, said the policy assistant director. He added: \"We've been very grateful for all the support that we've got across different agencies to come onboard… Everybody getting onto one system is not necessarily straightforward. \"All the agencies have different needs and we need to support (them) all.\" CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

SINGAPORE — A Singapore diplomat was fined 300,000 yen (S$2,580) on Thursday (June 13) by a court in Japan after filming a naked boy in a public bath in Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported. The 55-year-old man, identified as Sim Siong Chye by Japanese broadcaster NHK, was indicted on charges of trespassing and violating the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Anti-Nuisance Ordinance. Earlier on Thursday, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) told CNA that the officer did not have diplomatic immunity because his posting had ended as scheduled in mid-April this year. The man was a former counsellor at the Singapore Embassy in Tokyo. A counsellor is a diplomatic rank for officers serving overseas, such as in an embassy. According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a diplomat cannot be arrested. Japanese media reported on Thursday that the man has returned to Japan for questioning by the police. He arrived in Japan on June 9 following a request made by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department through Japan’s Foreign Ministry, reported the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. MFA said the officer \"chose to return to Japan to cooperate with investigations\" upon request by the Japanese authorities. \"The Singapore Embassy in Tokyo has engaged with the Japanese authorities to facilitate the ongoing investigations. We should wait for the outcome of these investigations,\" added the ministry. Japanese media reported in February that the diplomat had used his mobile phone to secretly film a 13-year-old first-year middle school student in the changing room of a public bath. The boy was naked. The police were called and \"multiple naked photos of male customers\" were found on his phone, according to Asahi at that time. It added that the diplomat refused to go to the police station but told officers he had taken such photos in other public baths. MFA said previously that the diplomat had completed his tour of duty in Tokyo as scheduled and returned to Singapore. It was made aware of the allegations on May 1 after it was contacted by Japanese media outlets. The diplomat did not inform the ministry of the incident until he was asked about it. He was then suspended from duties, with MFA saying on May 2 that it would be prepared to waive diplomatic immunity to facilitate investigations “if the alleged facts bear out”.

Madam Sie Choo Yong posing for a photo at her son's shop in Beauty World Centre on June 13, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A 102-year-old woman selling snacks, toiletries, toys, socks and other peripheral items at Beauty World Centre has gone viral on TikTok, after someone filmed her at a shop and asked the public to support her business. It turned out that making money was not top of her mind because she kept giving away extra items or even refusing payment. The shop, Lean Seng Lee Trading, is helmed by Madam Sie Choo Yong. Her age was confirmed by her family members who spoke to TODAY. The family also owns Lean Seng Lee Goldsmith, which is located just one floor above the provision shop at the shopping centre in Upper Bukit Timah. TikTok user \"dinahnahnah\" said in the video posted on Wednesday (June 12) that Mdm Sie gave her more lollipops even though she paid S$2 for two. She also seemingly charged a lower price for several items bought later by the TikTok user's husband. They could not understand what she said and when they recalculated and gave her S$20, telling her to keep the change, she refused and kept shoving more snacks in their bag. A passerby who helped to bridge the communication for Mdm Sie then told of the woman's grand age and encouraged the couple to patronise her shop more often. The video has been viewed more than 97,500 times and had 10,400 likes as of Thursday evening. As TODAY found out on visiting the provision shop, it belongs to Mdm Sie's youngest son and she is just helping to manage the store because staying at home is \"boring\", her son said. Due to her age, her voice was no longer clear and her speech not so coherent, but she energetically gestured with her hands her age when asked. She has seven children and 27 grandchildren. The provision shop was initially located at the old Beauty World — a market and shopping venue in the 1960s — and moved to its current location in 1984. It is just one of the businesses that her family runs. Mdm Sie's youngest son, who did not want to be identified, said that he chose to keep the store open for his mother so that she could do simple tasks and would not be alone and bored at home. He has no plans to hand over or sell the store for now. Mdm Sie hopes to keep running the store until she is no longer physically able to do so. Her second oldest son Lean Kee Suh, 66, who works at a Cold Storage supermarket in Bukit Batok, said in Mandarin that Mdm Sie emigrated from China in her 30s. He also said that she used to work long hours as a farmer in China. \"She worked from day to night, lifting bags that were up to 60kg.\" Even now, she is highly mobile for her age, standing up to attend to each customer and taking occasional breaks by sitting on a chair outside her store. She also lifted a bundle of newspapers, neatly arranging each copy. Mr Lean mentioned that his mother is extremely healthy, requiring no medication and rarely visiting the hospital. \"She is healthier than me,\" he said, adding that he was diagnosed with diabetes. \"This store does not make a profit, it is just for her to pass time. We would make more money renting it.\" Each day, Mdm Sie arrives at the shopping centre at 8am, she has her breakfast nearby and opens the store at around 9am. One of the neighbouring store owners, Mr Tay Kok Yih, 63, spoke of how mobile Mdm Sie was for her age and questioned lightheartedly: \"Is she really 102 years old?\" Just as she did in the TikTok video, when TODAY was at the shop, Mdm Sie was seen giving extra snacks to a child who bought from her. She also refused to accept payment when TODAY bought some biscuits, so the money was left at a counter. Most people who viewed the TikTok video looked kindly upon her, calling her \"a gem\" and \"sweet\", with some making promises to patronise her shop. One TikTok user wrote: \"Yes, please support this aunty. I grew up buying snacks from her shop since primary school. I’m hitting 30 and till this day she remembers me.\" Another wrote: \"I always drop by on Thursdays to buy something from them, she's always happy whenever someone patronises her store.\" One comment read: \"Thanks for sharing! I live just one stop away but never knew about this shop... Will definitely pay her a visit and support her.\" Nearest mrt is Beauty world mrt, downtown line.

This audio is AI-generated. PUTRAJAYA — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim clarified on Friday (June 14) that the government will not be employing English teachers from Singapore for Malaysian schools. Instead, he explained that what he had suggested to Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during their meeting earlier in the week was for teachers in the city state to teach English to disadvantaged children in poor and rural areas. Mr Anwar added that the scheme would be voluntary and fully funded by the Singaporean government. “Bahasa Malaysia is the language of instruction and the official language,” Mr Anwar said at an event held at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre “But we want to emphasise English, so I asked if there was a scheme from Singapore to help. “We are not appointing teachers from Singapore. Listen first. Some are bashing this on social media, but the facts are wrong. “What I discussed with the prime minister of Singapore is to organise an aid scheme, or to appoint volunteers who are paid by the Singaporean government to go to areas, especially in poor urban and rural areas, to teach English.” Mr Anwar said that it is his mission to build good rapport with neighbouring countries. “I want to build good relations between countries. We want to be good with Thailand, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, our important neighbours,” he said. “During our discussion, we talked about the Johor economic zone, along with investment and trade, and I suggested using the initiative to build good relations, by encouraging graduates from Singapore to participate in a volunteer scheme teaching English in Malaysia. That’s our recommendation.” Mr Anwar met with Singapore PM Wong on Wednesday during the latter’s two-day working visit to Malaysia. Among the topics discussed was the possibility of sending Singaporean teachers to Malaysia. Presently, Johor and Singapore are already working on a joint education project with a new curriculum that involves the exchange of programmes and teacher training.

A screenshot from a TikTok video showing migrant workers receiving free drinks. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A TikToker has gone viral for buying energy drinks for foreign workers in an act of kindness that he said makes his life more fulfilling. In a post on Thursday (June 13), TikTok user \"SomethingForSomeone\" shared a video of himself buying Red Bull and 100plus drinks for construction workers. When TODAY reached out to him, he declined to reveal his real name, but said that he was aged 24 and self-employed. In the video, he approaches some workers outside Khatib MRT Station after overhearing them talk about buying drinks. He asks how many people there were, before he heads to a nearby Giant supermarket to buy the drinks. \"Don't run away!\" he advises them. After giving each of the workers a drink, winning a hearty round of thanks, he later returns with more, asking them to give them to their driver or other workers. He wrote: \"Just imagine if you inspire one person and this person inspires another and the cycle continues.\" He added: \"Lastly, don't forget to do something for someone.\" The video has garnered more than 77,300 views and 4,000 likes as of Friday afternoon. In an earlier video, he gives out about 30 cans of Red Bull to workers who are maintaining public areas and thanks them for their hard work. Other videos on his TikTok account also show him buying food and drinks for strangers. Speaking to TODAY, he said that he had been doing this since early last month. \"I felt that something was always missing in my life. My heart felt empty.\" He said that he had always enjoyed helping others and hopes to inspire people, especially the young, to regain the \"kampung spirit\" — referring to the spirit of neighbourliness that existed among communal households in the days before people started living in high-rise housing. There is no specific location that he sticks to and he performs his good deeds in his free time or whenever he runs into people who needs help. He is not funded by any organisation, he said. \"I have support from the general public who believe in my cause.\" His efforts have won the hearts of many who thanked him in the comments below the video. One TikTok user wrote: \"Good job. Thank you.\" Another wrote: \"Thank you for doing this.\" His actions have also inspired some to do the same. One TikTok user said: \"I am going to do this with my girls this weekend.\" Another comment read: \"Me and my kids always waiting for your content.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Singapore’s water supply has not been affected by the oil spill incident at Pasir Panjang Terminal, the national water agency said on Monday (Jun 17). This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Singapore’s water supply has not been affected by the oil spill incident at Pasir Panjang Terminal, the national water agency said on Monday (Jun 17). “There is no impact to our freshwater reservoirs as the oil spill has been limited to our coastal areas and some coastal drains. These drains convey and discharge stormwater to the sea and are not linked to our reservoirs,” said PUB. Cleaning and containment efforts have been underway since the incident on Friday afternoon, when a dredger hit a bunker vessel at Pasir Panjang Terminal. Oil started washing up on Saturday along the coast of several beaches in Singapore, including those on Sentosa island and in East Coast Park, staining the sand black and sending the stench of petrochemicals into the air. PUB said no oil has been detected near the seawater intake at Jurong Island Desalination Plant, which is closest to the oil spill location. “Water quality readings remain normal. The Marina East Desalination Plant, located further along the coast, has a dual-mode capability with the flexibility to treat either seawater or reservoir water. It is currently in ‘reservoir’ mode and treating water from the Marina Reservoir,” said the agency. “We will continue to monitor seawater quality closely to ensure operations are not impacted.” The authorities said in a separate joint statement on Monday evening that the next phase of clean-up operations has commenced, involving the additional deployment of various booms and oil recovery systems. About 1,500m of booms have already been deployed, with plans to send out another 1,600m over the next few days. These will be placed at designated sites to support the containment of accumulated oil to facilitate the clean-up operation off the beaches and shorelines, said the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA), National Environment Agency (NEA), National Parks Board (NParks), Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and PUB. The authorities also noted that some of the oil was seen off Changi on Monday. Additional booms will be installed as a preventive measure off Changi East. A Current Buster system, a vessel-deployed specialised oil floating containment and recovery device, will also be deployed on Tuesday off the Changi Exhibition Centre as a \"pre-emptive measure\". The Current Buster consists of a boom with a skirt that extends into the water to corral and collect the oil on the surface. It is capable of accumulating up to five tonnes of oil in one craft-load before discharging. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been conducting daily air quality tests at affected areas along Sentosa, East Coast Park and Labrador Nature Reserve since Saturday. This is to ensure the safety of the public and personnel involved in the clean-up operations, said the authorities. The daily test includes measuring levels of volatile organic compounds that are commonly associated with bunkering fuels and other petrochemicals. This includes benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene. “Thus far, the air quality at the affected areas is well within safe levels. In addition, NEA monitors ambient levels of volatile organic compounds at various locations in Singapore and no anomalies have been detected.” As a precaution, the authorities advised members of the public against swimming at Changi beach and engaging in other “primary contact water activities” until further notice. Such an advisory is already in place at Pasir Ris and Sembawang beaches due to elevated bacteria count. CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Singapore's revised registers of electors will be open for public inspection from June 19 to July 2, the Elections Department (ELD) said on Tuesday (June 18). Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had directed ELD to revise the voter rolls and complete the revision by July 31, the department previously announced a month ago on May 20. The revised registers contain the names of all qualified electors as of June 1. Singaporeans are able to check their particulars in the registers on the ELD website or on the Singpass application. People who are unable to check their particulars online can do so at community centres and ServiceSG centres near their homes. They can also do so at the ELD office by making an appointment online or calling 1800-225-5353. Singaporeans who are overseas and unable to check their particulars online may do so at Singapore overseas missions serving as overseas registration centres. During the inspection period, Singaporeans may submit a claim to include their names if it has been omitted, or update their particulars if it is reflected differently from their NRICs, said ELD. An objection may also be submitted to remove a name from the register for the electoral division that they are in. Claims and objections may be submitted online on ELD's website, or in person at community centres, the ELD office, and Singapore overseas missions serving as registration centres. A list of claims will subsequently be made available for inspection from July 13 to July 20 at those locations. Those with their names removed from the registers for failing to vote in a past election may apply on ELD's website to have their names restored so they can vote in future elections, it said, adding that they are encouraged to apply early. \"Under the law, we will not be able to restore their names during the period from the date the Writ for an election is issued until after Nomination Day if the election is not contested, or until after Polling Day if a poll is to be taken,\" said ELD. \"Consequently, they will not be able to cast their vote if a poll is to be taken for the Electoral Division that they are residing in.\" Singapore's last General Election was on July 10, 2020, and the next one must be held by November 2025. Political analysts had cited September this year as a potential slot. On June 12, PM Wong implied that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) had not yet been formed when reporters asked him about the timing of the election. Convening the EBRC is a necessary step before calling a General Election. CNA has asked ELD for an update on the EBRC. CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Is it a green or red flag if a woman offers to help cover the cost of her pricey engagement ring? This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Is it a green or red flag if a woman offers to help cover the cost of her pricey engagement ring? Reddit user “No-Swan-3807” took to the online forum in a r/SingaporeRaw thread on Monday (June 17) to seek netizens’ advice on whether his girlfriend’s offer is acceptable. The Redditor said in his post that he plans to propose to his girlfriend, who has been “very involved” in the process and “knows exactly the kind of (engagement) ring that she wants”. He added, however, that he is able to afford only something “more modest than what she’d like”. As the ring of her dreams costs about S$7,000 more than his budget, his girlfriend has offered to chip in to cover the additional cost of the engagement ring. Still, the Redditor said that he feels “weird” and “bad” about going ahead with her suggestion, as he has not heard of anyone else doing the same. This prompted him to seek advice on the forum on whether he should accept her offer, or instead go ahead to “splurge” on the ring without accepting his girlfriend’s help. He added that his girlfriend earns twice as much as he does, which is why she thinks it is fine that she chips in – especially as the ring is “something that she insists that she wants, (and is not) a need”. Replying to comments in the thread, the Redditor explained that he works in healthcare and his girlfriend works in finance, and that she would “always earn much more than (he does), at least in the foreseeable future”. The post sparked a lively discussion, with more than 80 comments as of Tuesday evening. The majority of comments have lauded the Redditor’s girlfriend and regard her offer as a “major green flag” – indicating they think it’s a positive sign about the woman’s character and her approach to the relationship. Reddit user “confused_cereal” said: “Multiple green flags here: Offering to chip in, understanding differences between wants and needs, recognising your financial situation, being able to vocalise her wants.” Many have also called the girlfriend a “gem” and a “keeper”, with user “EastBeasteats” congratulating the Redditor for finding someone who is “marrying (him) for who you are, not your money”. Most users also agreed that it was fine to accept the girlfriend’s offer, given she would be the one wearing the ring and it is important that she finds something she likes. They added that he could make up for it or express his gratitude in other non-monetary ways. Redditor “xDraGonSaInTx” said: “I think I would let her chip in since it’d ultimately (be) her wearing it. However, I’ll make it a point to make it up to her in the future with other surprises without her needing to hint me that she chipped in. Sorta like a love upgrade.” Still, others were not so sure about accepting the girlfriend’s offer for various reasons. One user “Boring97979616”, for example, thinks it would be more meaningful for the Redditor to splurge on the ring given it is a special occasion, and to communicate to his girlfriend that she was worth the oversized price tag of the ring. The user said that as his girlfriend earns twice what he does, then presumably she has paid more than him for other expenses over the course of the relationship. “If that’s the case, I would say just splurge on it and spoil her at least for this occasion – you get to only buy her one ring in this lifetime. Besides, based on what you’ve posted, she seems to be worth the splurge.” Other commenters suggested that the Redditor decline her offer, lest his acceptance form the basis for arguments down the road. Beyond the mere cost of the ring, however, the post has also sparked discussions on what equality in a relationship looks like – with some Redditors questioning the original poster’s concerns about accepting his girlfriend’s offer. User “Prestigious-Toe8622” asked: “Sorry what’s the problem (here)? Her actions or your ego?” User “Slicelka” added: “At this age there is no such thing as the ‘man of the house’, accept that you both are equals, no one need to contributing more financially or effort because of gender, both have to do your part.” Agreeing, Redditor “INSYNC0” said: “Probably need to learn to embrace equality in this modern society. You feel bad because you have been drilled a mindset that the man is the one to propose, and to buy the engagement ring to surprise the woman. “With your wife earning twice of you, there will be many more things to come whereby it'll make more sense if she paid more than your share. This can be a first step. A relationship should function on mutual understanding and acceptance. If she is willing to do it for the sake of her happiness, why not?” Regardless of what users think about the offer, most, if not all, have congratulated him for finding someone who is a “green flag”, and agree that he should be quick to “put a ring on it”.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE – Singapore's 15-year-olds came out top in an international benchmarking study on creative thinking, even though they do not think of themselves as creative. Singapore students were tested on how well they generate creative ideas, as well as evaluate and improve on them in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) 2022. A total of 6,600 students from 149 secondary schools and 15 private schools, including international schools and religious schools, participated in the study, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a press release on Tuesday (June 18). Singapore also topped the scoreboard for mathematics, science and reading. Since 2012, Pisa has included an optional innovative domain in each testing cycle, such as creative problem solving, collaborative problem solving and global competence. Singapore ranked joint-first with Korea for creative problem solving, and first for the other two. Singapore participated in the creative thinking study because it is an \"important competency\" that helps to prepare young people for a rapidly evolving world, said MOE, adding that it was interested in having insights on how students have developed in this area. The findings are useful in improving the curriculum and training teachers to better nurture creative thinking in students, said the ministry's deputy director-general of education Sng Chern Wei. \"We certainly will be analysing the findings, and allowing us to learn from these findings the areas for further improvement, as well as areas of strength that we ought to affirm and preserve, despite the regular changes to our curriculum,\" he added. For example, to nurture creative students, they need to be given more space to experience unstructured activities and more exposure to aspects that allow them to come up with different ideas, said Mr Sng. MOE will take these into account during its curriculum reviews, he added. Students were presented with tasks that measure their ability to generate diverse ideas, generate creative ideas, as well as evaluate and improve ideas. This type of creativity can be developed through practice and is demonstrated in everyday contexts, MOE said. For example, in one exercise, students were presented with a book cover with the number \"2983\" on it, and were tasked to come up with an original story idea for the book. Conventional answers include an account of what life is like for humans in the year 2983, while an unconventional reference to the number \"2983\" in the story could be a more original idea. Participants were awarded full credits for uncommon ideas, and partial or no credits for common and conventional ideas. Singapore students ranked first in generating diverse ideas and generating creative ideas. They came second, behind Korea, in evaluating and improving ideas. Students were assigned to a proficiency level based on their results, with levels three and four, or a creative thinking score of 23 to 41, marking baseline performance. Those who scored below 23 points were regarded as low performers, while those who scored 41 and above were regarded as top performers, at proficiency levels five or six. About 58 per cent of Singapore students were top performers, attaining proficiency levels five or six. This is more than twice the OECD average proportion of 27 per cent, and the highest among all 64 participating systems, said MOE. The mean score in Singapore is 41, above the OECD average of 33. Singapore also had the smallest proportion of low performers at 6 per cent, below the OECD average of 22 per cent. Students from lower-socioeconomic status households also performed better than the average OECD student, with 36 points on average. Students in the top 25 per cent of households scored an average of 45 points. In most of the countries that participated in the study, girls performed better than boys on average, and Singapore was no different, although they were comparable in some aspects, said MOE. Girls scored an average of 42 points while boys scored an average of 40 points. Girls also outperformed boys in generating creative ideas, as well as evaluating and improving ideas. Despite performing well in the study, Singapore students did not think of themselves as creative. Just 64 per cent of them said they were confident or very confident of being creative, compared with the OECD average of 73 per cent. About 47 per cent of them said they were confident or very confident in telling creative stories, and 42 per cent of them thought they could produce good drawings, compared with the OECD average of 61 and 55 per cent. MOE noted that the conventional impression of Singapore students is that they are not creative and only book smart, and that this Pisa study was an instrument that could test this assumption. The outcomes are reassuring, and indicate that Singapore schools are not as uncreative as typical impressions of them would suggest, said the ministry, adding that it was \"surprised but not entirely shocked\" by the results. The Pisa results in the past 20 years can also debunk the notion that Singapore students are rote learners who cannot apply their knowledge, MOE added. \"A rote learner would not be able to perform in the Pisa main instruments so strongly cycle after cycle,\" it said. The study is a \"very affirming indication\" that Singapore students can think creatively to thrive in the future, which will demand more innovation and adaptability, said Mr Sng. Singapore students also reported favourable perceptions of their teachers’ pedagogies, which helped in nurturing their creativity, the Education Ministry said. The majority – 80 per cent – said their teachers valued creativity and encouraged students to come up with original answers. Students also reported positive family environments that fostered creative thinking. For example, 84 per cent of Singapore students noted that their family encouraged them to try new things. Schools and parents can work together to help increase students' confidence in their creative abilities, he added. Students may lack confidence because they have not received clear feedback on this aspect of their growth, since there are \"very few\" instruments that test creative thinking, Mr Sng said. \"Another possible reason may be that they are generally humble... and therefore don't rate themselves very highly when asked for their ability in creative thinking.\" CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — The overall recycling rate in Singapore has declined from 62 per cent to 52 per cent over the last decade, according to the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) latest statistics on waste and recycling. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The overall recycling rate in Singapore has declined from 62 per cent to 52 per cent over the last decade, according to the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) latest statistics on waste and recycling. In particular, paper recycling dropped from more than 50 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices, the agency said in a media release on Wednesday (June 19). In 2023, about 6.86 million tonnes of solid waste were generated, of which 3.55 million tonnes were recycled. This amounts to an overall recycling rate of 52 per cent, down from 57 per cent in 2022. Under Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, the country aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030. The drop is due to the amount of construction and demolition waste — which is almost completely recycled — \"dropping significantly\" last year, said NEA. Construction and demolition waste, which is a key industrial waste stream that is generated in large amounts, decreased by more than 40 per cent in 2023 compared to 2022, as there were fewer demolition projects, the agency explained. Sharp year-on-year changes in the amount of waste would result in \"huge fluctuations\" to the overall recycling rates, NEA added. The latest statistics also showed that the domestic recycling rate remained at 12 per cent, while the non-domestic recycling rate decreased from 72 per cent in 2022 to 67 per cent. The domestic waste generated per capita — collected from households and trade premises such as schools and hawker centres — also decreased by more than 15 per cent over the last decade. In 2023, the daily domestic waste generated per capita was 0.88kg, down from 1.08kg in 2013. Non-domestic waste per dollar Gross Domestic Product generated at industrial and commercial premises also fell from 40 tonnes in 2013 to 26 tonnes last year — a more than 30 per cent drop. The decrease in waste generated indicates that households and companies have taken \"positive steps\" to reduce and reuse, said NEA. The agency added that it will continue to study new ways to close the various resource loops. This includes looking into using mixed materials from Singapore's only landfill Semakau — which is made up of incineration ashes and other waste materials — for reclamation. During a speech at the joint opening Singapore International Water Week and CleanEnviro Summit on Wednesday, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said that the government is exploring new technologies that could generate higher value products from mixed solid waste, while also reducing carbon emissions. NEA will assess the information gathered on industry’s interests and the commercial viability of these technologies, she said. Where suitable, pilot trials may be conducted to evaluate the potential of expansion to full-size disposal facilities, added Ms Fu. NEA on Wednesday highlighted that there is a \"greater urgency\" for everyone to build a sustainability culture to reduce, reuse, and recycle. \"By reducing waste and recycling right, we can do our part to combat climate change and ensure that Singapore remains clean, green, and liveable,\" it added.

Ms Jovanna Yam, 21, executing a stunt while playing a piano in public at Orchard MRT Station. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Watching musicians channel their “heart and soul” into their craft can be uplifting. For Singapore TikTok user “migraineyy”, it looked like it was her heart, soul and some elements of a core muscle workout. The TikToker, Ms Jovanna Yam, 21, has gone viral after she uploaded a video of herself and a female partner playing a duet of a portion of American musician Hoagy Carmichael’s 1930s tune Heart and Soul. In the video, Ms Yam is not seated at the piano — instead she is lying while facing away from the piano with her upper back flat on the piano stool. Her hands are reaching backwards to the piano keys. Her feet, while not visible, seem to be on the floor. This means that her body is in a similar pose to what is known in the fitness world as the “bridge position”, which is designed to strengthen a person’s core muscles. It also means that she is playing with her hands behind her head, unable to see the keys. The other player is crouched near the piano. The pair appear to be playing a public piano situated at Orchard MRT Station, which is part of train operator SMRT ’ s Music in Community programme. The video, published a week ago and titled “When pianists get too bored”, has since garnered more than 210,000 likes, 5,000 shares and more than 500 comments. Several TikTok users complimented Ms Yam’s dexterity and flexibility, with comments such as “impressive”, “amazing” and “more than talented”. One TikTok user did not think that “(a strong) core is an issue”, but marvelled at how Ms Yam was able to do it. Ms Yam responded to the comment saying that relying on her “muscle memory” helped. Many users also praised her for her bravery in performing the feat at an MRT station, with one saying that a person would feel immediately “embarrassed” if people were to watch them. Another jokingly commented: “When your lower back hurts but you have to practise still.” Requests for Ms Yam to perform more songs, while in this position, have also poured in in the comments section of the post. Responding to TODAY’s queries, Ms Yam, who frequently posts piano content, said on Wednesday that she loves to come up with “creative ideas to entertain my audience”. This includes playing the instrument \"upside down\". “It’s uncommon to see pianists perform ‘tricks’, so I decided to do it in public as well.” She added that she has since picked up other song requests from her viewers who wanted her to play them in that position. She said that it was initially challenging to play this way because she was playing the piano backwards without looking at the keys. “I had to mentally ‘reverse’ the piano key structures and change fingerings, which teased my mind. Even sometimes, my mind and hand coordination do not sync,\" she added. “After a couple of attempts, I got the hang of it as my muscle memory and inner-hearing aided the whole process.” Ms Yam is pursuing a Bachelor of Education (Honours) in instrumental and vocal teaching at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. The degree programme is offered in collaboration with the Royal College of Music in London. She also works part-time as a freelance piano teacher, and teaches pop, classical and piano theory to students ranging from beginners to early advanced levels. “I feel that my efforts are greatly appreciated by the TikTok community since many of them felt impressed. “This has motivated me (to) post more unconventional and quirky piano content to inspire other musicians and bring joy to people.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

JOHOR BARU — Five family members of the suspect involved in the deadly attack on the Ulu Tiram police station were charged in the Sessions Court on Wednesday (June 19) for conspiring in promoting terrorist acts. They face a total of nine charges related to encouraging and cultivating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis) terrorist group’s ideology. On May 17, lone assailant Radin Luqman, 21, was killed after an unprovoked attack on the Ulu Tiram police station in the wee hours of the morning. Two police officers died from a machete attack, while a third was injured after being shot. The five family members who have been charged were identified as Radin Imran Radin Mohd Yassin, 62, his wife Rosna Jantan, 59, and their three children Radin Romyullah, 34, Farhah Sobrina, 23 and Mariah, 19. Malaysian media identified Rosna as a Singaporean and Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs has confirmed that to be true. All five family members arrived in the court’s compound in separate vehicles under heavy guard by the Special Branch’s counter-terrorism staff. According to the charge sheet, Radin Imran, the family’s father who is unemployed, faces four charges under the Penal Code: His son Radin Romyullah was charged with pledging his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakar and possession of an external hard disc drive containing materials related to Isis and the group's activities. Meanwhile the family’s mother Rosna and her two daugthers, Farhah Sobrina and Mariah, were handed one charge each for deliberately omitting to provide information regarding crimes related to terrorist ideology. The court did not offer bail and the accused were advised by the judge to appoint a lawyer to represent them in the cases.

An F-16 plane of the Republic of Singapore Air Force landing on a public road in Lim Chu Kang during a media preview in 2016. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Degraded components known as pitch rate gyroscopes led to a malfunction that resulted in the crash of an F-16 jet on May 8, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) said on Wednesday (June 19) after investigations concluded. Pitch rate gyroscopes are sensors that a flight control computer uses to control an aircraft and all F-16 fighter jets are fitted with four such gyroscopes. The pilot was unable to control the plane at take-off because its pitch rate gyroscopes gave erroneous inputs to the flight control computer, Mindef said on May 18. The pilot responded \"in accordance with emergency procedures\" and ejected within Tengah Air Base before being evacuated to hospital. Training for Singapore's F-16 fleet was temporarily suspended in the wake of the crash but resumed after the cause of the crash was identified. Mindef said in its update on Wednesday that two out of four pitch rate gyroscopes in the aircraft gave \"erroneous but similar inputs\" to the digital flight control computer. It was found that the two gyroscopes had degraded due to wear and tear and failed during take-off. Former Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) pilot Ong Swee Chuan previously told CNA that at any one time, three out of four of them are used and the average of two is taken to provide data to the flight control computer, With two gyroscopes registering erroneous inputs that were similar, the flight control logic \"accepted\" them as \"correct\" while rejecting the inputs from each of the remaining functioning gyroscopes as \"incorrect\", said Mindef. \"This caused the digital flight control computer to manoeuvre the aircraft in response to the erroneous pitch rate feedback signal from the two degraded gyroscopes, making the F-16 uncontrollable by the pilot,\" it added. The investigation, which was led by the RSAF and supported by Lockheed Martin and the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau, also concluded that the F-16 aircraft was maintained according to established protocols. The RSAF had adhered to required maintenance inspections, said Mindef Mindef added that the F-16's pre-flight built-in test \"did not detect any fault\" with the aircraft's gyroscopes before take-off. \"It is assessed that the two pitch rate gyroscopes had degraded due to wear and tear and failed during take-off,\" said Mindef. It added that the RSAF has put in place an additional preventive maintenance procedure for the gyroscopes to reduce the chance of a reoccurrence. RSAF engineers will periodically remove the F-16 gyroscope assemblies and test them using specialised equipment to increase the likelihood for engineers to detect early signs of degradation, said the Defence Ministry. This will allow them to \"pre-emptively replace the gyroscopes, before the gyroscopes reach the stage of accelerated degradation leading to failure\". This measure is over and above the prescribed aircraft manufacturer's maintenance procedures, noted Mindef. It also said that each RSAF F-16 aircraft's flight control gyroscopes had been checked and cleared before it resumed F-16 flights on May 21. \"According to Lockheed Martin, this is a rare occurrence and the first such failure reported to it since the F-16s first flew in 1974,\" said Mindef. With approximately 3,100 F-16s operating in 25 countries and over 19 million flight hours, Mindef added it remains \"confident in the operational capability and reliability of the F-16 to defend Singapore's skies\".

    "article_content": "News Workers cleaning up the oil slick at Tanjong beach in Sentosa, June 18, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — While several beaches in Singapore have been largely cleared of oil following an oil spill last week, Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said on Thursday (June 20) that it will still take \"some time\" before the oil is completely removed. In a joint statement on Thursday, Singapore's authorities said clean-up efforts by the National Environment Agency (NEA) are progressing well at East Coast Park and a \"large majority\" of oil deposits on the beach had been removed. The beaches at Tanah Merah have also been largely cleaned up, while the beaches on three Singapore islands — St John's, Lazarus and Kusu — as well as a \"large majority\" of Sentosa's Siloso beach have been cleared of oily sand, they added. In a Facebook post, Mr Chee noted the progress made in the clean-up, saying: \"Currently, we are focused on cleaning up the oil slicks and sheens from water and land which are visible through drone surveillance and satellite imagery. \"In the next phase, we would need to flush out stranded oil, such as those on oil-stained rock bunds... The clean-up operation will take some time, and I would like to seek the understanding of members of the public and businesses who are affected by this incident.\" On June 14, oil washed up along the coast of a number of beaches in Singapore after a Netherlands-flagged dredger, Vox Maxima, hit Singapore-flagged bunker Marine Honour at Pasir Panjang Container Terminal (PPT). This caused one of the oil cargo tanks on Marine Honour to rupture, spilling about 400 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel into the sea. The resultant oil spill that spread to several coastlines and stained the sand black was not caused by port congestion, Mr Chee said on Tuesday. The Maritime and Port Authority (MPA), NEA, the National Parks Board (NParks), Singapore's national water agency PUB, the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) on Thursday gave an update on the ongoing clean-up efforts. They noted that while the beaches at East Coast Park and Tanah Merah have been largely cleaned up, more efforts would likely be required as the tides may continue to sweep in remnants of oil deposits. The thorough cleaning of the oil-stained rock bunds facing the lagoon at Sentosa's Siloso beach will also start soon. As for Sentosa's Palawan and Tanjong beaches, clean-up efforts are ongoing, with more focused cleaning planned after the clean-up at Siloso beach is completed. The deployment of containment booms off the three Sentosa beaches have been completed, the authorities said. \"While the beaches remain open and island businesses are operating as per normal, sea activities and swimming are not permitted,\" they added. The recovery of accumulated oil off Labrador Nature Reserve and Cooper Channel is ongoing after booms were put in place on Tuesday, in addition to the booms deployed previously to protect Berlayer Creek and the Rocky Shore at the reserve. While the beaches at St John’s, Lazarus and Kusu Island have been cleared of oily sand, these beaches will be monitored for further signs of oil slicks, the authorities said. No oil was seen at Changi and Pasir Ris beaches as of Wednesday evening, but NEA will continue to monitor the situation closely. The public are advised not to swim at these beaches or engage in other primary contact water activities as a precaution until further notice. No oil has also been observed off biodiversity-sensitive areas at Chek Jawa Wetlands at Pulau Ubin, Coney Island Park and Pasir Ris Park. \"Absorbent booms will continue to be deployed there as preventive measures. No oil has been observed off West Coast Park and absorbent booms have been deployed as a precaution to protect the mangroves at the Marsh Garden,\" said the authorities. They added that there have not been any reports of oil slicks sighted off Changi since Tuesday. The northern part of Pasir Panjang Terminal has been cleared of oil slicks since Tuesday, while thorough cleaning using high-pressure jets of Berth 36 — which is near the area where Vox Maxima hit Marine Honour — is ongoing. In addition to three current busters already deployed — two of them are at western affected areas at PPT and Sentosa, while the other is at eastern affected areas off East Coast and Changi East — the authorities added that another current buster system will be deployed soon. A current buster is a system that is designed to collect oil on the surface of the water. Towed by two vessels, it sweeps the water's surface, funneling the oil towards an area where it is contained. In addition to containment booms laid at the mouth of Keppel Marina, a total of about 20 clean-up personnel and two skimmer systems have been deployed since Tuesday to recover the accumulated oil. Half-floating on the water’s surface, skimmers lift the oil off the water surface into storage tanks, ensuring that it does not also collect too much sea water in the process. ONE15 Marina has maintained restricted access to the marina while localised clean-up efforts are ongoing, said the authorities. They added that Singaporean authorities are in touch with Malaysian counterparts to cooperate on efforts to address any further impact of the oil spill. Together with Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are part of the Revolving Fund Committee, where the three littoral states can request and provide support for oil spills and clean-up operations in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. Singapore's fish farms have not been affected by the oil spill to date, the authorities said. \"Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, the SFA has taken fish samples from coastal fish farms in the East Johor Strait for food safety tests. The test results confirmed that our local fish are safe for consumption.\" The drinking water supply in Singapore is also unaffected, with quality reading remaining normal and operations at all desalination plants and reservoirs operating as usual, said PUB. Air quality at affected areas at East Coast Park, Labrador Nature Reserve and Sentosa \"remains well within safe levels\", said the authorities. \"NEA will continue to monitor the air quality at the affected areas daily to ensure the safety of the public and personnel involved in the clean-up operations. Information on air quality at affected beaches is published and updated daily on NEA’s website.\" CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

SINGAPORE — Civil servants in Singapore will receive a 0.45-month mid-year bonus, with junior grade officers getting an additional payment of up to S$250 (US$185), the Public Service Division (PSD) announced on Thursday (Jun 20). Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional payment of S$150. Those in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, as well as those in the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) Grades III and IV, will receive an additional payment of S$250. PSD said the mid-year payment takes into consideration both the better economic outlook and downside risks that remain in the global economy. \"The Government will continue to monitor the economic situation closely. It will take into consideration the guidelines by the National Wages Council which will be released later in the year, in determining the year-end annual variable component payments,\" it added. Last year, civil servants received a 0.3-month mid-year bonus and a 0.6-month year-end bonus, as well as the non-pensionable annual allowance of one month, also known as the 13th-month bonus. Junior grade officers also received an additional S$200 or S$400 as part of the mid-year bonus, and S$400 or S$800 at the end of 2023. The Singapore economy grew by 2.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of 2024, extending the 2.2 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has maintained the GDP growth forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent for 2024. \"The assessment takes into consideration that the external economic environment has remained resilient in the first quarter of 2024, although downside risks remain in the global economy,\" said PSD on Thursday. PSD added that the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Market Report for the first quarter of the year showed that total employment continued to expand albeit at a moderated pace. Unemployment rates remained low and within the range observed during non-recessionary periods. \"Our public sector unions had a productive discussion with the Public Service Division, where the unions called for the hard work of our civil servants to be recognised,\" said Ms Cham Hui Fong, deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). Given this year's positive economic growth despite uncertainties ahead, the Government's mid-year payout is \"reflective of the economic performance and acknowledges their efforts,\" she added. Mr Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari, general secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE), said that the payout, which surpasses the previous year's mid-year sum, would boost the morale of civil servants. \"While there are still uncertainties ahead, this payout fairly acknowledges the efforts of our officers and demonstrates progressiveness by ensuring lower-income officers can cope with inflation and rising living costs.\" CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

    "article_content": "News Given the extended periods of time that one would have to spend with one’s hostel mates in university, it is no wonder then that some students would go to great lengths to ensure that they pick a suitable hostel. Screenshots from a TikTok video showing a compilation of online comments gathered by Miss Jaime Aw on hostels at the Nanyang Technological University. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For many university students, moving into a hostel on campus during their undergraduate years is often seen as a rite of passage. Each residential hall is typically associated with its own unique hall culture, which attracts different types of students. Given the extended periods of time that one would have to spend with one’s hostel mates, it is no wonder then that some students would go to great lengths to ensure that they pick a suitable hostel. For TikTok user “wearyyyyyyyyyy”, this entailed creating an entire Google word document detailing what she has found about each of the 23 residential hall’s culture at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The TikTokker, Miss Jaime Aw, 20, will begin her first year of studies at NTU's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in August this year. She published a seven-second video on Wednesday (June 19) night showing snippets of the online document. Listed in the document are casual comments on halls that have a “chill” culture that “welcomes everybody to try out different (co-curricular activities) compared to the sports and dance halls”, halls that have “limited food options” and that seemingly have mould or persistent “termite issues\", or where students have encountered various wildlife such as monkeys, snakes and toads. Where available, Miss Aw has also attached images of the floor plans of hostel rooms. The information about NTU’s different halls includes their addresses and the price range for both air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned double rooms in the upcoming academic year. In a note at the top of the document, Miss Aw states that the information was gathered “mostly based on word of mouth and Reddit (or) other sources like Lemon8”. Reddit is an online forum and Lemon8 is a social media application by the creators of video-sharing app TikTok. It is not known if the information provided is accurate or verified. When contacted by TODAY, Miss Aw also said that she was not sure if the content is \"reliable\", but she was curious to know which NTU halls had the best and worst culture, because the main reason she is looking to stay in a hostel is to make new friends. Some TikTok viewers had asked that she make public the full document and she intends to do so eventually, she told TODAY. When she does so, Miss Aw said that she is open to receiving comments on what students feel their hall culture is like. Since it was uploaded less than 24 hours ago, the video has received more than 600 likes and been shared almost 150 times. It has sparked discussion on some of the hall choices. One TikTok user joked that “Crespion” — referring to NTU’s Crespion and Pioneer halls — were “the best”, sarcastically remarking that they had “no hall culture at all”. Another TikTok user said that Halls 8 to 10 have several stairs and residents could be heavily exposed to dust due to the nearby construction of an MRT station, before adding that freshmen at the university are not allowed to choose their halls and it is randomly allocated. This TikToker also said that the “rec lists” for most halls have since closed for the new intakes. “Rec lists” refer to lists of recommendations of prospective hall residents that can be put forth by a senior student already residing in that hall. Some students believe that being placed on a hall’s “rec list” may raise their chances of being accepted into that hall of their choice. Acknowledging in a comment that the university’s freshmen are unable to select a residential hall of their choice, Miss Aw said that she would instead be using this as reference in the future to prepare herself for what to expect of each hostel's culture. On Thursday evening, she posted another video saying that she made the online document for herself, but asked viewers to give their take on what the halls are like in the document, which she then shared in the comments section of the video.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — While serving as an investigating officer in the Singapore Police Force, Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras forged statements that he was tasked to take from witnesses for investigation. Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras arriving at the State Courts on June 20, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — While serving as an investigating officer in the Singapore Police Force, Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras forged statements that he was tasked to take from witnesses for investigation. On at least one occasion, he called a person over the phone and took notes before crafting his own statement based on the notes he took and backdating the document to meet an overdue deadline. Another time, he submitted a statement without interviewing the person directly. After resigning from the police force, he applied to be called to the Singapore Bar as a lawyer. During this application, he falsely declared that he was not under investigation, even though he was being investigated by the police for the said forgery offences. On Thursday (June 20), the 33-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to 25 months’ jail after pleading to nine charges of forgery and one of intentionally giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding. Another 29 forgery charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. The court heard that Willjude’s supervisor in the police force had found his performance to be poor and spoke to him on several occasions, without seeing any progress after that. He was with the Woodlands Police Division at the time. When reviewing his case files on Jan 26 in 2019, the supervisor saw that identical statements were recorded from two witnesses for two unrelated cases. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Grace Chua said that this led the supervisor to suspect that the statements may have been forged. “She called the witnesses to check if the accused had recorded statements from them and was told that he did not,” DPP Chua added. When questioned, Willjude admitted to forging the statements. A “thorough” review of all his case files uncovered 38 forged statements across 21 case files. Some of the affected cases were re-investigated where necessary, with fresh statements taken. “It was found that all case outcomes were not affected by the forgeries,” DPP Chua said. On one occasion, Willjude was handed a case in November 2018 but failed to record statements from the two witnesses involved despite being given time extension until Jan 5, 2019. The day before the extended deadline, he called one witness over the phone, took notes and wrote up a statement based on his own notes. He did not call the other witness and penned his own statements. For both forged documents, he wrote the date as Dec 30, 2018 in order to give the impression that they were recorded before the deadline. For another case that he was assigned sometime in January 2019, he was tasked to interview two persons. However, he “felt that there was no need to do so” and instead forged their statements, aligning the contents to the statements of two other witnesses he had earlier interviewed, DPP Chua said. Willjude resigned from the police force on April 19 in 2019 while investigations for his forgery offences were ongoing. Law-trained, he applied to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor. When submitting a sworn affidavit dated Dec 22, 2020, he gave false evidence by declaring that he was not under any investigation. A senior consultant at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) diagnosed Willjude with adjustment disorder, which later evolved into major depressive disorder. The doctor found a contributory link between Willjude’s mental condition and his forgery offences, but no contributory link between the condition and the offence of giving false evidence. Seeking a total sentence of 30 months’ jail, DPP Chua said that the need for general deterrence “applies with a special force” for law enforcement officers who break the law and abuse public trust in the course of their duty. The forgeries committed also have the potential to “shake public confidence” in the police, she added. She also mentioned that some aggravating factors were the calculated manner in which Willjude committed the offence, as well as the extensive efforts to track his forgeries and re-investigate the affected cases. Defence lawyer Azri Imran Tan highlighted his client’s psychiatric condition as a mitigating factor in asking for a lower sentence of between 12 and 17 months behind bars. He argued that Willjude's offending behaviour was \"out of character\" and quoted the IMH doctor's report, which stated that Wulljide was working in a “toxic and depressogenic” environment under the supervisor that reported his offence. Depressogenic describes something that could cause someone to develop depression. The inspector was “driven to overwhelming depressive despair, for instance, to act in ways which he would not when mentally healthy\". Mr Tan added, though, that no aspersion is being cast against his client’s supervisor or the police force, but he was just setting out the conditions that had affected Willjude at that time. For each count of forgery, Willjude could have been sentenced to a jail term of up to four years or fined, or both. For giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding, he could have been jailed up to seven years and also been fined.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — The Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) new light machine gun and PUB's water wagons will make their debuts at this year's National Day Parade (NDP) at the Padang. Assets, including those that will be making their debut at this year's NDP, on display on June 21, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) new light machine gun and PUB's water wagons will make their debuts at this year's National Day Parade (NDP) at the Padang. This year's parade will commemorate 40 years of Total Defence, Singapore's national defence concept. The inaugural Total Defence segment at the Padang will showcase how the community and government respond to various scenarios such as air and maritime threats as well as civil emergencies and disruptions. It will include 40 assets and more than 400 participants from the Singapore Army, Republic of Singapore Navy, Republic of Singapore Air Force, Digital and Intelligence Service, Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). National water agency PUB and the Singapore Red Cross will also be part of the segment, said the NDP executive committee in a news release on Friday (June 21). PUB's water wagons will also be making their National Day Parade debut. Equipped with 1,000L water tanks, these wagons provide relief in times of disruption to the water supply. This year's parade will also feature the Singapore Red Cross Transporter vehicle, which can carry volunteers and essential logistics during civil emergency exercises. The vehicle is equipped with a wheelchair lifter and can seat up to 10 people, including the driver. It can also be used in peacetime. Other assets making their appearance at the parade include F-16 fighter jets, the Leopard 2SG main battle tanks and the light fire attack vehicle, also known as the Red Rhino. More than 2,100 participants from diverse backgrounds will take part in this year's parade and ceremony. A total of 35 marching contingents, including 24 from youth uniformed groups as well as social and economic organisations, will form the parade led by parade commander Lieutenant Colonel Roger Cheong Soon Yong. Besides the usual contingents, this year's NDP will also feature the return of a contingent comprising volunteers from the SAF and Home Team. They will be making their first NDP appearance since 2019. Sixteen supporting contingents — from the SAF, SPF and SCDF, as well as volunteer and youth uniformed groups — will move to create the characters \"TD40\" to commemorate 40 years of Total Defence, said the executive committee. Speaking to CNA on Friday, Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Mohamed Ayub Said Abdul Kader, who is the parade Regimental Sergeant Major, explained that the formation's execution came with its own set of challenges as there was a lot of movement involved. With the contingents walking in different directions, the words \"'TD40' must come up beautifully\", he said. To overcome those challenges, MWO Mohamed Ayub said he spoke to his predecessor from 10 years ago — when there was a similar formation during NDP to mark 30 years of Total Defence — to learn the \"tips of the trade\". The 42-year-old added that he is backed by a well-trained team, made up of members with years of experience, to give him guidance on how the formation can be achieved. During the parade, there will also be a choir music video featuring more than 130 students from nine school choirs, including seven special education schools. Crowd favourites such as the Red Lions, state flag flypast and presidential gun salute will continue to be part of the NDP and will be broadcast live on television and internet platforms. This year’s presidential gun salute will include four 25-pounder guns on the Mobility 3rd Generation raft that will sail around the Marina Basin. The 21-gun salute is the highest military honour reserved only for the President and is timed to match his progress while inspecting the parade. NDP 2024 will also feature an Onward March at the Padang for the first time, where marching contingents will march onto the spectator stand. CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

    "article_content": "News This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will require Carousell and Facebook to verify the identity of all their sellers if the number of scams reported on the respective platforms \"does not drop significantly\". The ministry will assess over a six-month period the effectiveness of both e-commerce platforms' measures to only verify the identity of sellers they deem \"risky\". If the scam situation fails to improve, MHA will then require them to apply user verification requirements on all sellers. This is part of the second tranche of provisions under the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) that was passed in Parliament in July last year, MHA said on Friday (June 21). The new measures will come into force on June 24. OCHA targets online content used to facilitate scams and malicious cyber activities. Under the latest measures, authorities will issue two codes of practice — one for online communication services and another for e-commerce services. The online communication code applies to online communication services Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram and WeChat, which MHA identified as presenting the \"highest risk of scams to Singapore users\". Under this code, providers of these online services must implement systems, processes or measures to detect and act against scams, use \"reasonable\" verification measures to prevent fake accounts or bots, require strong login verification, and submit an annual report on the implementation of these measures. Providers of the online communication services will be required to comply with the online communication code by Dec 31. On the other hand, the e-commerce code applies to online services that facilitate e-commerce activities and \"pose the highest risks of e-commerce scams among other services in Singapore\". Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Advertisements, Facebook Pages and Carousell will be required to comply with the code by Dec 31. These platforms accounted for more than 70 per cent of e-commerce scams in 2023. The code shares the same requirements as the online communication code, with two additional stipulations. Users must be verified against government-issued records if they advertise or post about the sale of goods and services, or if they intend to do so. Services must provide payment protection mechanisms that verify the delivery of goods or services before releasing payment to sellers. \"These additional requirements are based on what MHA assesses to be more critical in protecting Singapore end-users from e-commerce scams,\" the ministry said. The online communication code, along with the code of practice for e-commerce services, will take effect on June 26, MHA said. Under the e-commerce code, MHA will prioritise the implementation of user verification requirements, which it assessed to be the \"most critical to curb scams\". For a start, it will allow Carousell and Facebook Marketplace to only apply verification requirements on \"risky sellers\" before expanding to more users if the scam situation fails to improve. \"Risky sellers\" are users identified by these platforms as potential sources of scams. MHA said on Friday it will assess the effectiveness of Carousell's measures to verify the identity of \"risky sellers\" between July 1 and Dec 31. \"If the number of e-commerce scams reported on Carousell does not drop significantly, MHA will require Carousell to verify the identity of all sellers by April 1, 2025,\" it said. A similar assessment will be conducted for Facebook Marketplace between June 1 and Nov 30, MHA added MHA will require Facebook Marketplace to verify the identity of all sellers by March 1, 2025, if the number of e-commerce scams reported on the platform \"does not drop significantly\". MHA also said that it will require Facebook to verify the identity of all advertisers by April 1, 2025, if the number of scam reports arising from advertisements on Facebook \"does not drop significantly\". Between July 1 and Dec 31, MHA will \"assess the effectiveness of Facebook’s measures to verify the identity of risky advertisers\", it added. MHA said it will not implement the user verification measure for Facebook Pages for now to allow Facebook to \"prioritise implementing user verification for its Marketplace and advertisements this year\". In a statement to the media on Friday, Carousell said that its users will be required to verify their identities using Singpass if its system \"detects behaviour similar to known scam patterns or policy violations\". Singpass verification is currently required only for two categories — property and tickets and vouchers. The marketplace platform will also be launching a safety policy to educate users on \"risky behaviours\", such as paying directly to the seller before receiving the item, said Ms Tan Su Lin, Carousell's chief of staff. OCHA, which was passed in Parliament on July 5 last year, allows the government to order the takedown of websites, apps and online accounts suspected to be used for criminal activities. The threshold for ordering a takedown is lower for a particular category of criminal offences — scams and malicious cyber activities. For scams and malicious cyber activities, directions can be issued \"when there is suspicion or reason to believe that any online activity is being carried out in preparation for or as part of the commission\" of such offences, said Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. The directions may order a person or an online service to stop communicating specified online content, disable the content from being viewed, stop an account from communicating, block access to a web domain, or remove an app from an app store for Singapore users. Some measures under OCHA took effect on Feb 1, allowing the government to issue directions and orders to limit the exposure of Singapore users to criminal activities on online platforms. The measures also allow the government \"to require information to administer the Act and facilitate investigations and criminal proceedings\". Some criminal offences OCHA covers include those relating to: MHA said it would waive the requirement on payment protection mechanisms for now to allow services to prioritise implementing user verification, adding that it would reassess this in 2025. The need for this requirement will be assessed based on the effectiveness of the user verification measures in reducing e-commerce scams, it said. The ministry also said it will \"review the list of designated online services regularly based on the prevailing scam situation\". MHA added that all designated online services, including Carousell and Facebook Marketplace, are required to submit a report on the implementation of measures to comply with the requirements in the codes of practice. \"The competent authority will assess the adequacy of these measures and decide if further or enhanced measures would be required,\" it said. For Carousell and Facebook Marketplace, if the competent authority assesses that the measures are inadequate - for example, if there is no significant drop in the number of reported e-commerce scams - it may issue a new code application notice to require them to verify the identity of all sellers. If a provider of a designated online service has not complied with any requirement applicable to it, a rectification notice may be issued to it to correct the non-compliance by a specified time. \"Failure to comply with the rectification notice is a criminal offence,\" said MHA. An implementation directive may also be issued to the provider to \"implement a specific system, process or measure to address the risk of scams or malicious cyber activities\", it added.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — The fourth stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL4) will improve connectivity for residents, but “it will get even better” in the coming decade with the opening of more MRT lines, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong takes a tour of Siglap MRT Station during the opening ceremony of Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 4 on June 21, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The fourth stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL4) will improve connectivity for residents, but “it will get even better” in the coming decade with the opening of more MRT lines, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. “Over the next decade, we will open over 50 new MRT stations, including the new Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line – our seventh and eighth MRT lines,” Mr Wong said at the opening ceremony of TEL4 on Friday morning (June 21). The ceremony was held at Marine Parade station, one of seven new stations along TEL4. The other stations are Tanjong Rhu, Katong Park, Tanjong Katong, Marine Terrace, Siglap and Bayshore. The seven new stations opened to the public for a preview from noon to 9pm on Friday, before passenger service officially starts on Sunday. Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, recounted his days growing up in Marine Parade in the 1980s. “Back then, I wished there was an MRT station near my home in Marine Terrace, then I could have taken the train directly,” he said. He added that while he no longer lives in the area, he is glad residents can enjoy faster public transport that is affordable. Students will also benefit, with more than 10 schools within walking distance of a TEL4 station. TEL4 will also bring East Coast closer to Singaporeans from other parts of the island, noted Mr Wong, adding that popular food options in areas such as Joo Chiat and Katong would also be more accessible. He thanked residents along the TEL4 stretch for their patience while construction works were underway. Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat was also at the opening ceremony, along with Members of Parliament for constituencies which TEL4 passes through. They included Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat of East Coast GRC, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Speaker of Parliament Seah Kian Peng of Marine Parade GRC, as well as Mr Lim Biow Chuan of Mountbatten SMC. Former Prime Minister and former Marine Parade MP Goh Chok Tong and former Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan were also in attendance, along with representatives from rail operator SMRT, which runs the TEL. There were also performances by students from Tao Nan School, and local singers Lim Zi Yi and Karyn Wong. With the opening of TEL4, 27 out of 32 TEL stations are now operational, said Mr Wong. For residents farther east, the fifth stage of the line – connecting Bayshore and Sungei Bedok – will be completed by 2026, while an extension to connect the TEL to Changi Airport will be completed in the mid-2030s, together with the opening of Terminal 5. When completed, the TEL’s eastern end will connect to Changi Airport, while its northern end will connect to the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. “When the TEL is fully completed, our train network will connect Singaporeans from their doorstep to the world,” said Mr Wong. He said that the TEL is just part of the government’s investment in Singapore’s public transport system. “We are certainly not done expanding the rail network,” he said. The upcoming Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line will improve connectivity within the western region, and connect the eastern, northeastern and western regions respectively. In the coming years, new stations and extensions on existing lines, such as the North-South Line, Circle Line and Downtown Line, will also be opened. Ultimately, by the 2030s, eight in 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk of a train station, said Mr Wong. “Millions of Singaporeans and residents can reach their destinations using public transport easily and conveniently, day in and day out,” he said. Mr Wong added that, in Singapore, when there are plans made to build something, “eventually it gets done”. “In many other countries in the world, including in advanced countries, people talk about doing projects, but very often it’s not so easy to get things done,” he said. There could be issues with budgeting, resistance from residents or even political reasons, he said. “Sometimes, political parties change and the new party comes into power and they shelve the plans from the previous party,” he said. “Here in Singapore, when we say we will do something, we make sure we deliver it.” Other than improving connectivity, the TEL has also been designed to ensure accessibility for those with special needs, said Mr Wong. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had consulted widely with community partners, such as the Singapore Association for the Deaf and Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped, to incorporate inclusive features when designing TEL stations, he said. For instance, station signs have larger fonts, with sharper contrast and less clutter, and there is more braille text to aid the visually impaired. Hearing enhancement systems have been installed at the passenger service centres in TEL stations, which minimise the background noise for commuters wearing hearing aids. There are also more lifts and station entrances, to benefit those who face mobility challenges. “These features will benefit persons with disabilities, but also seniors and families with young children. They will enable all Singaporeans to take the train comfortably and confidently,” said Mr Wong. After his speech, Mr Wong spoke to SMRT and LTA staff, as well as TEL4 contractors. He then took the train from Marine Parade to Siglap, where he spoke to representatives from the Singapore Civil Defence Force about its shelter conversion operations for train stations. He also spoke to some students from Victoria School, which is located near Siglap station. At 11.30am outside Marine Parade station, members of the public had formed a long line to await the opening of the TEL4 preview. Among the earliest to get there was Marine Parade resident Jay Suresh, who said he has an avid interest in train stations. “I personally love the MRT, I love getting off the train stations and seeing the different areas, all the shops,” said the 21-year-old. The intern at a tech firm said his commuting time to his workplace in Alexandra will be reduced by about 30 minutes with the opening of TEL4. He currently takes the bus there, but he will soon be able to get to work via the TEL and the East-West Line with a change of trains at Outram Park station. “It’s definitely a big improvement from having to take the bus everywhere,” he said.

SINGAPORE — A Singapore company rewarded one of its migrant workers with a surprise visit from his wife and toddler daughter on Father's Day weekend. This year, celebrations for Pollisum Engineering's 40th anniversary happened to coincide with Father's Day on June 16. Before that, it held a lucky draw, where the winner, 36-year-old Sun Ke, was only told that he would receive a video message from his family. Then on June 16, Pollisum Engineering, which describes itself as a \"heavy lift and transport\" company, held its anniversary celebrations at the Montigo Resort in Batam, Indonesia. There, it invited Mr Sun Ke, a lorry crane driver who had been with the company for 10 years, on stage to watch the video message from his family. To the worker's surprise, his wife and daughter were ushered in soon after that. In a video shared by the company, a tearful Sun Ke could be seen rushing off the stage to share a warm embrace with his family. \"I feel like I'm dreaming,\" he said. He had been unable to see his family for over a year, because his daughter was still too young to travel. Speaking to TODAY in Mandarin, the worker said that he had been \"completely kept in the dark\". He had just spoken to his wife the day before the company bash and had planned to visit his family in September. His family had taken a six-hour flight from Jinan, China, to Singapore and a one-hour ferry ride from Singapore to Batam for the reunion. Mr Sun Ke and his family also enjoyed an extended vacation hosted by Holiday Inn Express & Suites from June 17 to 19. He said that his daughter \"kept asking for her father\" when it was time for his family to leave. \"I'm really looking forward to seeing them again.\" Pollisum Engineering described Mr Sun Ke as a \"dedicated husband and father\" who had undergone a one-month quarantine when he returned to China in 2021 to be with his wife when she was about to deliver their daughter. The girl was born in December that year as the Covid-19 pandemic was raging. He had to return to Singapore when his daughter was three months old. Pollisum Engineering said that its commitment to reward and acknowledge loyal employees is an \"integral part\" of its company culture. The company said: \"As a migrant worker, he (Mr Sun Ke) has limited time to spend with his family. \"Thus having them with him on Father’s Day was a morale boost that motivated him to further dedicate his skills and talents to grow with the company.\" Pollisum Engineering has a workforce of 278 employees with 78 per cent of them being migrant workers from mainly China and Malaysia. The company holds an annual dinner and dance to recognise the contributions made by its employees and celebrate the firm's achievements.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The temporary hike to the taxi surcharge on rides from Changi Airport and attractions at Mandai Wildlife Reserve will be made permanent from July 1. ComfortDelGro and Strides Premier announced the impending permanent fare hikes on their Facebook pages on Monday (June 24). ComfortDelGro added that \"location surcharges are imposed by the respective locations\". CNA has contacted Singapore's two other taxi companies, Trans-cab and Prime Taxi, on whether they will follow suit. The S$8 daily surcharge for taxi trips from Changi Airport from 5pm to 11.59pm, and S$6 at all other times was first introduced in May 2022, before being extended. Changi Airport said in 2022 that this was to \"ensure a better supply of taxis\" to the airport for passengers. The temporary location surcharge from the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Night Safari and Bird Paradise for trips between 1pm and 11.59pm daily will also be made permanent from July 1, with the surcharge increasing from S$3 to S$5. The temporary location surcharges were introduced over two years ago to cushion the impact of the recent increase in fuel prices and also ensure a better supply of taxis for passengers. Both ComfortDelgro and Strides Premier said the revised permanent surcharge changes would only be reflected on their respective websites from July 1. CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — A 32-year-old man was on Thursday (June 13) sentenced to seven weeks’ jail for sending sexual messages to two children under the age of 14 when he was a student care teacher in a primary school. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A 32-year-old man was on Thursday (June 13) sentenced to seven weeks’ jail for sending sexual messages to two children under the age of 14 when he was a student care teacher in a primary school. The man, Tristan Teo Hong Xian, pleaded guilty in April to two charges of engaging in sexual communication with a minor and one of distributing an obscene image. Another charge of distributing an obscene image was taken into consideration for sentencing. His case was adjourned at the time to see if he would be suitable for a mandatory treatment order, which is a community sentencing option offered to offenders suffering from mental conditions that contributed to the offence. On Thursday, District Judge Wong Peck said the fact that there were multiple victims, their young ages and Teo's abuse of his position of trust were aggravating factors in the case. The children and the student care centre cannot be named under a court order to protect the identity of the victims. The court heard that Teo was working as a student care teacher in a primary school from April 2018 to February 2020. In the course of his work, he became acquainted with one of the victims, a boy, then aged 11, who was not in his class. In December 2019, Teo posted a picture of himself while on holiday in Japan. The boy was also on a holiday in Japan and added Teo on Instagram. The boy realised that Teo was a student care teacher at his school and they began communicating over Instagram. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) R Arvindren said that the initial conversation between the accused and the second victim was non-sexual in nature. Sometime in August 2020, the teacher began asking the boy about his private parts and told him that he wondered what they looked like as he was curious. Teo later admitted to the police that he wanted to \"hold back\" his sexual desires but eventually \"gave in to the temptation\", DPP Arvindren added. Around a year later, Teo got in contact with the second victim, a girl, then aged 13. She was also studying in the same school and was friends with the male victim. Teo communicated with the girl over Instagram and WhatsApp, and asked her to trade pictures of their private parts sometime between August and December in 2021. The girl declined to send a photo but Teo sent a one-time-view photo of his private parts to the victim. After a break of about 10 months, in June 2022, Teo asked the girl over WhatsApp if he could again send pictures of his private parts and if she remembered that he had previously spoken to her about his \"horny problems\". The girl replied to Teo that he should \"stop letting your desires control you\" and blocked him on June 13, 2022. That same month, the girl created a second Instagram account under a fake identity and contacted Teo to gather evidence on how he had been sending sexual messages to her and her friend. He knew that the person behind the Instagram account was a minor under the age of 16 and engaged in sexual communication with the account holder, but did not know that the girl was behind the account. On June 22, 2022, a police report was made stating that Teo had sent photos of his private parts to two children. Court documents did not state who made this report or how Teo was arrested. Defence lawyer Harjeet Kaur on Thursday asked for probation or a combination of a short detention order and a community service order to be considered for Teo, arguing that rehabilitation should be the primary consideration in Teo’s sentencing. \"While the offences committed are in no way submitted to be trivial, they are not so egregious that rehabilitation has been totally displaced,\" she argued. Ms Kaur said that her client had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and autism spectrum disorder after the commission of the offences. Referring to a medical report, she said that because Teo did not have the opportunity to undergo appropriate training and education for his condition, he was unable to form relationships with persons of his own age and could only form relationships with adolescents. Ms Kaur argued that Teo’s condition would make him a “highly vulnerable” prisoner. The constant close contact with others would also “distress him severely” due to his hypersensitivity to touch. She further argued that if rehabilitation was not at the forefront and that deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration, she would want to seek a jail term of no more than three weeks and two days for her client. DPP Arvindren sought a jail term of seven to eight weeks. He outlined factors such as the victims’ vulnerability due to their age, Teo’s position as a teacher at the student care centre and the fact that he had repeated his acts to multiple victims. In response to the defence’s arguments, DPP Arvindren emphasised that Teo had admitted to the police that he committed the offences because of his sexual desires. This was further supported by the mandatory treatment order suitability report that found no contributory link between his condition and his offences. He was also not impaired from appreciating the nature of his acts and their wrongfulness, DPP Arvindren added. District Judge Wong said in her remarks that she agreed with the prosecution that a jail term is appropriate because the charges are serious ones. “There is an abuse of trust, in that the accused in the present case is a student care teacher in the same school as these very young victims,” she added. She also took into account the multiple victims involved and the findings in the mandatory treatment order suitability report. For each count of engaging in sexual communication with a minor under the age of 14, Teo could have been jailed for up to three years or fined, or sentenced to both punishments. For distributing an obscene image, he could have been jailed not longer than three months or be fined, or both.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — On multiple occasions, a man chained his son, aged 10 or 11, to a metal bar in the toilet for up to five hours as punishment for telling lies or not doing his homework. File photo of the Singapore State Courts. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — On multiple occasions, a man chained his son, aged 10 or 11, to a metal bar in the toilet for up to five hours as punishment for telling lies or not doing his homework. On at least one occasion, he repeatedly hit the boy with a rubber hose because the boy had angered him by texting his wife, from whom the man had divorced. On Friday (June 14), the 53-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to two years’ jail after pleading guilty to three counts of ill-treating a child under his care. A charge of criminal intimidation was taken into consideration during the sentencing. The parties involved cannot be named under a court order to protect the victim's identity. The court heard that at the time of the offences, the man had custody of his biological son after a divorce with his wife. On Nov 30, 2022, the man learnt that his son, had been texting his mother despite being told to cut off contact. He became angry and slapped the boy on the left side of his face, causing injury and pain in the victim’s left ear. He then used a yellow rubber hose to hit the victim on the upper left arm, back and left thigh, causing multiple bruises. The boy was taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital to treat his injuries. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Jocelyn Teo said that the offender also admitted that he had hit the victim on previous occasions. Investigations revealed that at least three times in 2022, the man also secured the boy’s ankle or wrist to a fixed metal bar in the toilet, using a metal chain and padlock. He would put a rubber hose between the metal chain and the victim’s skin to protect him from injury if he struggled, and put some food and water in the toilet, leaving the victim there for two to five hours. The man would either sleep or leave home, exposing him to potential danger in case of emergency such as a fire, the prosecution said in its sentencing submissions. DPP Teo said: “The accused did so to punish the victim for lying, not doing his homework or not keeping his promise such as not to contact his mother.” Police were alerted to the child abuse case by a staff member working with the National Anti-Violence Helpline on Dec 4, 2022. Court documents did not indicate which incident led to the police report. Seeking a jail term of between 28 and 31 months, the prosecution pointed to the “extensive” injuries suffered by the child and the abuse of position of trust on the part of the father as aggravating factors. Defence counsel Mansur Husain sought a shorter jail term of between 12 and 15 months, describing the term sought by the prosecution as “excessive”. He said that his client is apologetic for his mistakes and pleaded for leniency so that he could put this chapter of his life behind him as soon as possible. In delivering his decision, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt described the punishments in the case as “harmful and completely unnecessary”. He added that the defence had also conceded that the offender had crossed the line between disciplining a child and committing these criminal acts. For each count of ill-treating a child, the man could have been jailed for up to eight years or fined up to S$8,000, or both.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Between 2019 and 2023, David Chua cheated customers of a travel agency where he worked and strangers on Carousell to fund his gambling habit. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Between 2019 and 2023, David Chua cheated customers of a travel agency where he worked and strangers on Carousell to fund his gambling habit. In all, he had taken in excess of S$160,000 from the various victims, including from one victim he cheated with “persistence” 25 times. On Friday (June 14), the 36-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to 21 months’ jail after pleading guilty to two charges of cheating and one of criminal breach of trust. Two other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing while one was discharged amounting to an acquittal. The court heard that between September and October 2019, while Chua was working at Holiday Tour & Travel as a travel consultant, he asked six customers to make payment for their tour packages directly to him instead of the company. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Ryan Lim said: “On at least two of those occasions, he told the customer that he would be able to provide discounts if they did so.” By the end of October that year, he had misappropriated the money — amounting to S$22,400 — and used it to repay his gambling debts. The company conducted internal investigations after a customer notified them that he did not receive the promised vouchers and travel itinerary. Chua's employment was terminated on Oct 31 and the company made a police report the next day. Between Aug 13 and Oct 23 in 2022, he cheated five people of at least S$20,830 through online marketplace Carousell by promising to sell them tickets to an e-gaming tournament. The buyers never got the tickets. Court documents did not state whether or not Chua had such tickets to offer in the first place. Of the five victims he fleeced, he made full restitution of S$900 to three of them and made none to two others, including one from whom he cheated S$17,260. Sometime in or before August 2022, Chua became acquainted with a sixth victim who saw an advertisement he put up on Carousell. Between August and October that year, the male victim transferred about S$36,740 to him, after Chua offered various purported investment opportunities. Around December that year, Chua told this sixth victim that the trading account used for one of the victim’s investments had been frozen. He instructed the victim to get in touch with his supposed friend and broker named \"Khun Nai\" for assistance. Khun Nai was Chua himself. On 25 occasions between Dec 17, 2022 and Jan 31, 2023, Chua who was posing as Khun Nai instructed the victim to transfer various sums of money, said to be for purposes of withdrawing his investment capital. In reality, the money was transferred into Chua’s bank account or his accounts on gambling websites. On each occasion, the victim transferred anything between S$500 and about S$7,625, totalling almost S$87,700. This excludes the roughly S$36,740 cheated from the victim between August and October 2022, and another excess of S$40,000 in personal loan that Chua borrowed from the victim. The victim eventually filed a police report on Feb 4, 2023. Chua has repaid the victim S$10,500. Seeking between 21 and 24 months’ imprisonment, DPP Lim highlighted how for the first offence, Chua had betrayed both the trust of his employer and his customers, and made no restitutions to the parties. He then exploited online platform Carousell to reach a “wider pool of potential victims” when carrying out his ticket-selling scam. In regards to the last victim, DPP Lim said: “The accused displayed persistence in extracting monies from the victim, cheating him on 25 occasions”. DPP Lim also noted how Chua displayed a level of planning by posing as a broker and coming up with a ploy to trick the victim into parting with even more money. For each count of cheating, Chua could have been sentenced to 10 years’ jail and fined. For criminal breach of trust, he could have been jailed up to 15 years and been liable to a fine.

File photo of the Singapore State Courts. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Angered that a youth was supposedly harassing his female friend, a 17-year-old male gathered four friends to beat him up, before forcing him to strip naked and drink urine while threatening him with a parang. On Tuesday (June 18), the offender, now 18 , was sentenced to two years' probation with various strict conditions, including one year at Singapore Boys' Hostel. He must also serve 100 hours of community service. The teen pleaded guilty in April to one count each of rioting with a deadly weapon and criminal intimidation, with one charge of fighting in a public place taken into consideration for sentencing. All parties cannot be named as they were under 18 years of age at the time of the offences. According to court documents, the offender met up with four male friends sometime in March 2023 and told them he wanted to beat up the victim as the victim had been harassing his female friend. They agreed to accompany him. The teen messaged the victim, then 16, using his female friend’s Instagram account to meet at a multi-storey car park toilet in Bukit Batok for sex on March 20. The victim agreed. When the victim arrived and knocked on the toilet door, the offender opened the door and pulled him in. His four friends who were nearby, followed the victim in. The offender held a parang on the victim’s neck, threatening to cut him. While smoking, he ordered the victim to strip naked and threatened to slash him with the weapon if the victim was not naked before he finished his cigarette. “The victim obeyed as he was scared,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Pavithra Ramkumar. After the victim stripped himself, the offender asked him to kneel before physically assaulting him. He then asked the victim to apologise to his friend. The offender later passed the victim a bottle which his two friends had urinated into, and forced the victim to drink its entire content. The victim was later assaulted by one of the offender’s friends. The offender and his friends filmed the victim at various points of the ordeal. The offender then ordered the victim to wear his clothes and allowed him to leave, but warned him that he would attack him again if he reported the incident to the police. At about 9.20pm the same day, the victim returned home. His father noticed his injuries and took him to National University Hospital the next day and later made a police report. The offender was identified via police camera footage and arrested on March 22. Two of the offender’s friends who were involved in the incident have been sentenced to probation, while the cases for the remaining two are still pending. Along with the probation, the offender's mother is required to lodge a S$5,000 good behaviour bond on her son's behalf. Four months after his discharge from the hostel, the teen is to attend a violence prevention programme. Addressing the offender's mother in court on Tuesday, the judge advised her to give her son a lot of encouragement and support as he serves his sentence. For rioting with a deadly weapon, the teen could have been jailed for up to 10 years and caned. For criminal intimidation, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — While in a drunken stupor in the wee hours, a man punched a police officer who had been called to attend a squabble near Boat Quay involving about 10 men. Devesh Raj Rajasegaran arrives at the State Courts on June 18, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — While in a drunken stupor in the wee hours, a man punched a police officer who had been called to attend a squabble near Boat Quay involving about 10 men. The single punch was so powerful that it knocked the officer unconscious “for at least a minute” and caused him to suffer from temporary memory loss. On Tuesday (June 18), the man, Devesh Raj Rajasegaran, 24, was sentenced to five weeks’ jail. He had pleaded guilty in March this year to one count of voluntarily causing hurt. His defence counsel said on Tuesday that he will be appealing against the sentence. The court heard that the victim was one of four police officers dispatched to an area in Circular Road on June 25, 2022 after a member of the public informed them at around 3am of “more than 10 people having an argument”. Prior to this, Devesh and his friend, Eeshwar Ravi, were drinking alcohol nearby. When the police arrived, they spotted a group of individuals including Devesh and Eeshwar involved in a \"commotion\" in Circular Road opposite BK Eating House. The officers, who were wearing civilian clothes at the time, approached the group, identifying themselves as police officers. Three of them were volunteer police officers. While the victim and another officer were interviewing a member of the group, Devesh approached them to confront the individual who was being interviewed. Soon after, Devesh threw a punch, hitting the police officer on the left side of his head. Deputy Public Prosecutor Brian Tan said in court documents: “The accused was intoxicated when he punched the victim. As a result of the accused’s punch, the victim lost consciousness for at least a minute.” The officer was later taken to the Singapore General Hospital by ambulance. Between the time he was punched and when he reached the hospital, he drifted in and out of consciousness several times. The victim was given seven days’ hospitalisation leave and reported suffering temporary loss of memory and bad headaches for at least three days after the incident. For voluntarily causing hurt, Devesh could have been jailed for up to three years, ordered to pay a fine of up to S$5,000 or both.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — For almost three years, a woman entered into an arrangement with her foreign domestic worker to “safekeep” all her salary instead of paying her monthly as required by law. Wu Xiaoling, also known as Nur Nadhrah, leaving the State Courts on June 18, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For almost three years, a woman entered into an arrangement with her foreign domestic worker to “safekeep” all her salary instead of paying her monthly as required by law. The employer, Wu Xiaoling, also known as Nur Nadhrah, ended up accumulating almost S$24,000 in arrears of wages to her maid. She later paid her, but only about half the amount. On Tuesday (June 18) Wu, 38, was handed a S$10,000 fine after pleading guilty to two amalgamated charges of not paying the helper her salary no later than seven days after it was due. Four other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The court heard that the domestic helper, Tumpik Astuik, had worked for Wu since Dec 4, 2018. Wu had agreed to pay Tumpik a monthly salary of S$670 on the 29th of each month. The amount was raised to S$680 after the maid’s work permit was renewed on Aug 15, 2020. The Employment of Foreign Manpower Act requires an employer to pay a helper her salary no later than seven days after it is due. Sometime in June 2019, Tumpik asked Wu to “safekeep her monthly salaries in full”. “They entered into a safekeeping arrangement whereby the accused would safekeep Tumpik’s salary until the end of Tumpik’s employment,” said manpower ministry prosecutor Jasmine Koh. Tumpik made a complaint to the Ministry of Manpower sometime in March 2022 via the migrant domestic worker helpline that her employer had not been paying her wages. She stopped working for Wu on June 7. The prosecutor did not say why the helper had entered into the arrangement in the first place, what led to the eventual complaint or why she decided to stop working for Wu on that date. According to the prosecutor, the total salary “safekept” by the employer was S$23,848.08. Wu paid Tumpik on June 5, but only S$11,750. The employer subsequently paid off the amount owed after investigations against her commenced. Seeking a total fine of between S$12,000 and S$14,000, Ms Koh pointed to the duration of the offences as well as the amount owed to the maid over the long period. Wu’s defence council pleaded for the court’s leniency, saying that she had owed Tumpik the wages as her income was hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He added that she initially wanted to let go of the maid, but did not want to leave the migrant worker in “double jeopardy” of not being employed and having to bear the costs of staying in Singapore. He added that Wu has also made restitution to Tumpik since then. For each count of not paying the helper's salary no later than seven days after it was due, Wu could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$10,000, or both.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Over the course of about eight years, a woman who proclaimed herself to be a deity had close to 30 followers who turned to her because they were suffering from serious medical conditions or had relatives who were suffering, and were \"desperate for healing\". This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Over the course of about eight years, a woman who proclaimed herself to be a deity had close to 30 followers who turned to her because they were suffering from serious medical conditions or had relatives who were suffering, and were \"desperate for healing\". Preying on their vulnerable state, she cheated them of more than S$7 million and made them take another S$6.6 million in loans. She would mete out punishments for followers who did not listen to her orders. One devotee had her teeth pulled out, suffered a permanent eye injury and was forced to jump from the second floor of a building. Others had to eat human faeces. On Wednesday (June 19), Woo Mei Hoe, a 54-year-old Singaporean, was sentenced to 10.5 years' jail. She had pleaded guilty in May to two charges each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt and cheating, and one charge of instigating a person to cause hurt with a dangerous weapon. Another 45 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. In her brief remarks when meting out the sentence, District Judge Ong Chin Rhu noted the breach of trust between Woo and her followers and the extent of financial and physical harm the victims suffered. As for the cheating offences, the judge said that Woo committed them in a “calculated and cruel” manner and over a sustained period. The judge took into consideration Woo’s guilty plea and her paranoid schizophrenia that a doctor assessed had a contributory link to the offences of hurting others, but not for cheating. Paranoid schizophrenia is a form of psychosis. People who suffer from it need medication and therapy to manage the symptoms, which can include having persistent and unusual beliefs and thoughts, and being suspicious of people and a general fear of other people's intentions. The court previously heard that Woo led a group of people who believed in Sri Sakthi Narayani Amma — a spiritual leader in India — and they met up frequently for ritual sessions, prayers and spiritual teachings that would last until the wee hours of the morning. In court documents prepared by Deputy Public Prosecutors Timotheus Koh and Grace Chua, they said: “During the sessions, the accused told her followers that she was a deity with the ability to communicate with gods and spirits and dictated that they refer to her as ‘lord’.” Woo taught her followers that they could clear their “bad karma” and increase their “good karma” by making payments to Amma’s society in India, via payments made through her. However, she then kept the money for her own use. Aside from getting her followers to make monetary payments ranging from thousands to millions of dollars, she ordered her followers to buy condominiums and cars as a purported “form of worship”, which she used for her own enjoyment. Some of the devotees depleted their savings and pawned their valuables. Others sold their houses and took up extensive loans from banks, among others. In all, Woo cheated a total of over S$13.61 million from them — comprising about S$7 million from her followers and another S$6.61 million in loans they took from financial institutions. Between 2013 and 2015, Woo cheated one follower of S$3.5 million, purportedly for the expansion of a school compound in a village in India. She also cheated the same victim of another S$2.5 million for a fictitious temple building project. As the victim was suffering from a serious medical condition and had extensive medical bills of her own, payments were made in instalments to Woo of S$100,000 a month. Woo also severely punished her followers with “violent and degrading” punishments from time to time if they displeased her, the prosecution said. “This included hitting her followers with various implements such as paintbrushes and canes, stabbing them with scissors, using pliers to pull out their teeth, forcing them to consume human faeces and making them jump off from a height.” She would either carry out the punishments personally or ask other followers to inflict them. Around 10 followers resided with Woo to serve her full-time. One victim, who resided with Woo, was hit repeatedly on the head and face with a bundle of five canes by Woo when she was unhappy with the victim. The victim, who was in severe pain and had blurry vision, was told by Woo to use some “holy water” to wash her eye and stare directly into the sun to treat the pain. Her optic nerve was found to be damaged and she will require lifelong medical care for her injured eye, which suffers from weak vision. This same victim also had her teeth pulled out with pliers by another follower under the Woo's order. Woo was unhappy that the victim went to visit her mother without informing her. This was not the first time that the victim had her teeth pulled out as punishment, the prosecution said. The victim was also forced to jump down from the second floor of a building, leading her to suffer fractures on her feet. A doctor at the Institute of Mental Health assessed Woo in 2020 and found her to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of her offences, with a “contributory link” between her condition and the offences where she caused hurt to others. However, he found no contributory link between her mental state and her cheating offences, the prosecution added. The prosecution sought a jail term of between nine and 12 years, noting how Woo's actions had \"completely shattered\" the lives of her followers and caused permanent physical disability to some of them. It pointed to her abuse of the \"exceptional trust\" that her followers had placed on her as an aggravating factor. Defence counsel Caryn Lee pleaded for a lighter sentence of 69 months' jail for her client. She reiterated that her client suffers from mental illness. Woo had made partial financial restitution of S$675,000 to the victims as well. District Judge Ong took into account some of the aggravating factors such as the extent of the injuries the victims suffered and that Woo had inflicted them \"gratuitously as a form of punishment\". If not for the Woo's mental illness, \"the facts of the case would have called for substantially higher uplifts to the starting sentences for each charge\", she added. For the cheating offences, the judge outlined factors such as Woo's \"greed\" and the sustained duration of the deception among the aggravating factors. For each count of cheating, Woo could have been jailed up to 10 years or fined, or both. A person convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt can be jailed up to 10 years and be liable to a fine or caning. However, Woo cannot be caned by law since she is a woman.

A stock photo of a lift at a housing block in Singapore. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A 68-year-old man was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment on Wednesday (June 19) after pleading guilty to a charge of molestation of a girl under 14 years of age. Sim Kian Hong, a Singaporean, molested his neighbour in May last year when she was 10 years old. The victim’s name cannot be published under a court order to protect her identity. Court documents showed that the victim was on the way home from a nearby supermarket after buying groceries at about 4pm on May 8, 2023. She stopped for a while along the pavement to catch her breath when Sim approached her. The girl recognised him as a neighbour who lived in the same housing block. He offered to help carry her items back home but she declined. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Andrea Gan said that Sim then walked ahead of her, but his pace matched the girl's. When they reached their housing block and entered the lift, Sim stood slightly behind the girl. “The victim used her handphone to avoid getting into a conversation with the accused,” DPP Gan said. Sim then put his hand near the girl's shoulder while leaning forward such that his face was close to hers. He then reverted to standing upright before touching her chest over her clothes “for about 14 seconds”. Feeling uncomfortable and scared, the victim got out of the lift quickly once it reached her floor. She made a police report the next day. DPP Gan sought an 8.5 months’ jail term, saying that Sim displayed “some degree of predatory behaviour”. “Further, as the accused lives in the same block, and the molest took place in the lift of the victim’s own block, the victim may be forced to relive her trauma constantly,” DPP Gan added. A molest offence carries a jail term of up to three years or a fine or caning, or a combination of any of these punishments. For molesting a victim under the age of 14, a person can be jailed up to five years, fined or caned, or be handed a combination of any of these. Sim cannot be caned by law since he is above the age of 50. Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

A view of the entrance to the State Courts building. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Two women were charged on Thursday (June 20) with starting a fire outside a public housing unit along Canberra Road and planning to set a second fire. Alexandria Tammy Lim Xuan Yi, 25, and Clara Yip Zi, 20, were each handed two charges: One of committing mischief by fire, and one of conspiring to commit mischief by fire. Both women appeared in court without any legal representation, via a link from their place of remand. The police on Wednesday evening said in a press release that they received a report at 10.35pm on Monday about a case of fire. This was outside a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat along Canberra Road in Sembawang. The two women were identified and arrested the next day. Court documents showed that they both allegedly set fire to three slippers outside the front door of a flat at Block 352C along Canberra Road on June 17. The pair, along with another unknown person on messaging application Telegram, also allegedly agreed at about 2am on Tuesday to set fire to the house door and shoe rack outside a housing unit along Hougang Avenue 3. Court documents did not mention when they intended to carry out their plan. On Thursday, Yip informed the court that she intends to plead guilty. The court offered her bail of S$15,000 but required a parent to be one of the bailors, to which Yip said that she has “no parents”. When asked by the judge to clarify this, she said that both had “died already”. Her case will be heard again on June 24 for a bail review and on Aug 1 for her guilty plea to be taken. For Lim, the prosecution informed the court that she is under further investigations for cheating-related offences. Bail of S$15,000 was also offered to her. Her case will be heard again in court on July 18. If convicted of committing mischief by fire or conspiring as such, a person can be jailed for up to seven years or fined.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — For about 13 years, Ng Kwong Seng worked for an illegal moneylending syndicate, rising through the ranks from a salary-drawing support worker to a “towkay” or boss entitled to profit-sharing and with loan sharks reporting to him. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For about 13 years, Ng Kwong Seng worked for an illegal moneylending syndicate, rising through the ranks from a salary-drawing support worker to a “towkay” or boss entitled to profit-sharing and with loan sharks reporting to him. While he was mostly based in China during that period, the Singaporean targeted debtors in Singapore, charging 20 per cent interest for the loans and relying on runners based here to carry out operations. On Friday (June 21), Ng, now 44, was sentenced to 51 months’ jail and a fine of S$495,000. However, as he was unable to pay the fine, he was ordered to serve another 33 weeks behind bars in default. He pleaded guilty earlier this month to seven charges of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending. Two other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Court documents showed that Ng was recruited into the syndicate sometime in mid-2006 by an ex-colleague who offered him a job as an office support staff member in China for a monthly salary of S$2,000. Ng accepted it because he was unemployed in Singapore. He started working for the syndicate in an apartment in Shenzhen, China. It was financed by a person identified in court documents only as \"Ah Ren\". Ah Ren was the syndicate's “tua towkay”, or big boss. Reporting to him were \"towkays\" or bosses responsible for managing the operations of various \"ah longs\", or unlicensed moneylenders. Ng started off by helping an ah long known as \"Freddi\" solicit debtors from Singapore, calling up phone numbers from a database provided to him. He would work from 11am to 4pm and make about 150 calls a day. He was promoted to an “assistant ah long” in January 2008 and was authorised to give out small loans when Freddi was busy. He was then promoted to a full-fledged ah long in July that year, after Freddi left the syndicate for unknown reasons. Ng had runners based in Singapore to carry out tasks such as verifying information and collecting and issuing money to debtors. From end-2008 to mid-2010, Ng moved his operations to Bangkok, Thailand before returning to China. As an ah long, he was entitled to up to 20 per cent of the business profits, depending on a certain threshold of profit made. He was then drawing between S$3,000 and S$5,000 a month, inclusive of the base salary of S$2,000. Sometime in end-2014, he was promoted to towkay, with three ah longs reporting under him. He took no basic salary but was entitled to 60 per cent of the profits — though a portion of this would go to the three loan sharks. He earned an average of between S$10,000 and S$12,000 a month. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Emily Koh said that Ng did not harass debtors. This was done by another person identified as \"Xiao Fu\", who would arrange for runners or debtors in Singapore to conduct harassments of other debtors. Sometime in 2019, Ah Ren, who was the big boss and financier, was arrested and Ng left the illegal moneylending business. He remained in China working as a sales manager of a liquor company until June last year. DPP Koh said that Ng had planned to get his two daughters — aged 11 and six — to Singapore to continue with their education. “As such, the accused decided to stop working in China and return to Singapore to settle his case,” she added. Ng was eventually arrested on Nov 1 last year at Changi Airport. “In the course of investigations, the accused admitted that he earned profits of around S$500,000 from his unlicensed moneylending business from 2006 to 2019,” DPP Koh said. The money was spent on his family, personal expenses and for gambling in casinos in Macau and Hong Kong, she added. In delivering her decision, Principal District Judge Jill Tan noted the cross-border nature of the illegal moneylending business as well as the prolonged period Ng had conducted the business as main aggravating factors. The significant numbers of borrowers and amounts disbursed, as well as the excessive interest charged, were also aggravating. Even though Ng “did not personally” carry out harassment of debtors, he was aware that threats were being made for debtors who had difficulties in making payments, the judge added. However, she took into consideration in Ng’s favour the fact that he had voluntarily returned to Singapore, co-operated with investigations and pleaded guilty to his offences. For each offence of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending, Ng could have been sentenced to a fine of between S$30,000 and S$300,000 and a jail term of up to four years, and also been liable to caning.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — A 16-year-old resident of Singapore Boys’ Hostel on Friday (June 21) admitted to beating up a younger fellow resident, making the victim strip naked and lick his shoes, among other degrading acts. A view of the entrance to the State Courts. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A 16-year-old resident of Singapore Boys’ Hostel on Friday (June 21) admitted to beating up a younger fellow resident, making the victim strip naked and lick his shoes, among other degrading acts. The offender pleaded guilty to four charges in relation to the abuse of the victim, who was under 16 years of age at the time. The charges were: Five other charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. All parties in this case cannot be named to protect their identities. The court heard that the victim, the offender, along with a co-accused identified in court documents as B2, were residents at the hostel. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Matthew Choo said that the offender and B2 stole some money from the victim, but when the victim confronted them sometime on or before July 19 last year, they denied the accusation and “took offence”. On the evening of July 19 itself, the offender and B2 forced the victim to go into a common toilet in the hostel and assaulted him. The offender warned the victim not to “falsely” make such accusations again or “there will be people waiting” for him outside his school, DPP Choo said. All three bumped into another teenager outside the toilet and recounted what just happened to the victim. This other teenager then told the pair not to beat up the victim any further, and reported the matter to the staff members of the hostel the next day. Two days after the toilet incident, B2 and the offender met the victim outside the hostel and pressured him to skip school with them. When they were out, B2 called a friend of the offender — another co-accused teenager who did not reside in the hostel and identified as B3 — to join them. The offender and B2 told B3 that they wanted to beat up the victim for the supposed “false” accusation and for reporting them to the hostel staff members over the toilet incident. The offender, B2 and the victim then met B3 at a car park in Punggol. Here, the trio allegedly slapped, punched and kicked the victim all over his body. B3 then allegedly recorded their assault of the victim using a mobile phone. The trio demanded that the victim strip naked, which he did out of fear, before beating him up further. They then made the victim lick the shoes of both the offender and B3 multiple times, with the offender kicking the victim’s face in the process. The three teenagers continued to hurt and insult the victim, such as kicking him in the groin area many times, making him kneel and beg for forgiveness and perform a dance in the nude, while recording him using mobile phones. At one point, one of them even recorded a close-up of the victim’s private parts. The offender also sent a video of the victim dancing in the nude to the teenager who had reported the toilet assault incident to the hostel. After the ordeal that lasted for about half an hour, they warned the victim to not inform anyone about what had happened or he would be beaten up again, and they left the scene. The victim got dressed, called his form teacher and headed to school. A school counsellor took him to the hospital, where he was examined and found to suffer from multiple swelling and bruises. He was later admitted to the ward, though the court documents did not mention how long he was warded. B2’s case is still pending before the courts, while B3 is undergoing investigation. The offender is expected to be sentenced in July. A person who distributes child abuse material can be jailed for up to seven years, fined or caned. Harassment carries a jail term of up to six months or a fine of up to S$5,000, or both. For voluntarily causing hurt, a person can be jailed for up to three years or fined up to S$5,000, or both. A person convicted of insulting a person's modesty can be jailed for up to one year or fined, or both.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When I paid a visit to Wax Guitar Services near Beauty World MRT Station recently, I was greeted by the sight of the instrument repair shop’s young owner Hazieq Nizam lost in his work. He was hunched over an electric guitar with a dead serious expression on his face that was lit by a tiny desk lamp reflecting off the instrument he was holding. Not wanting to interrupt, I paused to take in the smell of soldering iron and the sound of John Mayer’s guitar riff playing on a music system in the background as I looked around the interior of his six-month-old shop. Not that it took long to finish scanning around the 8-sqm humble studio. Mr Hazieq’s serious expression immediately broke into a grin when we exchanged pleasantries. “Hi, I’m Wax,” the 25-year-old guitar technician said, using the nickname that his friends and clients call him. Guitar technicians such as Mr Hazieq provide a range of services from fixing faulty instruments such as guitars and bass guitars , modifying them to desired specifications or setting them up to make them comfortable and easy to play for their owners. Although there are quite a number of such technicians here — I myself know a dozen and have sent guitars to about half of them — there are some traits that make Mr Hazieq stand out from the rest. Many of such \"techies\" provide their services from home. Most who do have a physical store are much older than him, have operated for years, if not decades, and are well known by guitar enthusiasts in Singapore. Besides being a super young towkay (boss) of his own shop, Mr Hazieq has learnt from luthiers and technicians here and in neighbouring countries. A luthier is an artisan who builds or repairs stringed instruments with a neck and soundbox, such as a guitar. Another string to his bow: Mr Hazieq has provided his services to visiting international acts. Now he is travelling around Europe and the United Kingdom to provide his services to support Singapore band Wormrot on their tour. The band play what is known as grindcore, often described as an aggressive sub-genre of heavy metal. Mr Hazieq plays guitar in his own band as well, but his true passion is nurturing the instruments of others. Music has been front and centre almost his entire life, Mr Hazieq told TODAY. He grew up in a family of music lovers and was constantly exposed to various types of music. One story told by his parents is that the first discernible sounds out of his mouth as a baby were not words. Mr Hazieq said: “There's this very popular song called Master of Puppets. So I was babbling the intro riff even before I said my first few words.” Master of Puppets is a 1986 classic track from heavy metal band Metallica. Even the moniker Wax is a reference to the song I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of? by American rock band A Day To Remember. Mr Hazieq began playing guitar in his teens. During his days as a polytechnic student, he took up an electronics-related module and joined a performance co-curricular activity where he began tinkering with guitars. “In our inventory at that time, there were about 20 faulty guitars. So in my spare time, I tried repairing them out of instinct and it made me realise, 'Hey, I can do it'.” He later worked as an intern at a music retailer where he learnt the craft from a guitar tech. Mr Hazeiq recalled how at one point as a student, he sent his own guitar to a tech for a set-up, but the service was disappointing. \"I gave him all the limited money that I had, but when I got it back, (I found that) this guy only changed the strings,\" he recalled. As he took up this type of work as a side gig of his own, that early experience made him strive to price his own services affordably. “If a 15-year-old kid wants to come to my shop asking for guitar repair, I will not have the heart to charge him a good amount of money,” he added. From the earnings made up of such relatively affordable fees, the money he saved from this side gig for about five years was eventually enough for him to invest in a studio space of his own early this year. He declined to reveal how much he spent on the studio, only to proudly say that he did not take up any loan for his business venture. To scrimp and save further, he put in a lot of work by himself when setting up shop. He built his own work table, painted the shop and did the lighting himself — instead of paying others to do it for him. “Because I come from a humble background, I understand the value of money. The money shouldn't be spent on unnecessary things.” As I surveyed Wax Studio, I saw that between the working bench against the left wall and the racks of customers’ instruments on the right, there was barely enough space for one person to sit. Yet, there was enough room for the little signs of Mr Hazieq’s outsized achievements and proud moments. On the mini-fridge door at the end of the room and on the wall above his work bench were backstage passes and Polaroid photos capturing various acts he supported. They include American post-rock band Caspian and international guitarist Yvette Young from math-rock band Covet. \"I grew up with (Young's) music, so for me to be able to work on her guitar is already a crazy experience,\" he said. When Canadian rock band Sum 41 came to Singapore as part of their farewell tour, Mr Hazieq also “understudied” their touring guitar and bass tech Tom Reardon , a renowned technician who also works for acts such as Matchbox 20 and a few others. Near the back of his guitar shop was an acoustic guitar that he handcrafted on his own while staying for a month with a luthier in Malaysia last year. He had spent the month isolated on the outskirts of its capital city Kuala Lumpur purely to deepen his knowledge of guitars and wood, he said. It was also during his stay in Malaysia that he got inspired to go all-in and make guitar servicing his full-time job. “To be honest with you, at age 25, I did not think about making guitar repair as a full-time job at first,” he added. Then, he read a book while taking a break there one day and came across a quote, which he read to me: \"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\" He said: “So (what I learnt was), if you have an idea, or if you have something that you want to do, just give your best.” While he would encourage others to pursue their dreams, he was not shy to tell of the amount of hard work he has to put in to make his own come true. His shop officially operates until 7pm, but he typically works through until 10pm. He did not want to say much about his ambitions or long-term career plans, adding that he prefers to share more about his plans with others only after they have materialised. What he would let on was that he would love to get opportunities to work for other acts both here and overseas. And for his brand, he would love to see Wax Studio offer more services for all music lovers out there. At the moment, he is ecstatic about touring with Wormrot for their 24-stop tour around Europe and the United Kingdom from early June to July. “This is going to be my very first tour with a band, and also my first time in Europe” he told TODAY excitedly in the studio before he left Singapore. Asked to look back at what he has achieved so far, he leaves no doubt about his commitment, despite the highs and lows that come with running one's own business. \"Doing what I love is very fulfilling and I wouldn't have it any other way.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — A former yoga instructor was on Thursday (May 16) found guilty of five counts of molesting three women during yoga sessions he conducted. File photo of the Singapore State Courts. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A former yoga instructor was on Thursday (May 16) found guilty of five counts of molesting three women during yoga sessions he conducted. But Rajpal Singh, 34, was also acquitted of three other molest charges, after the judge found that the fourth victim had supported him through WhatsApp messages to the yoga studio’s owner and judged this to be “incongruent with her allegations of molest”. Singh, who is an Indian national, had earlier claimed trial to eight counts of outrage of modesty. He was accused of smacking his victims' buttocks and touching their private parts during his classes at a Trust Yoga outlet in Telok Ayer. The outlet has since closed down. None of the women can be identified because of a court order protecting their identities. The incident made headlines in July 2020 after a former student alleged in a viral social media post that she was sexually assaulted at one of Trust Yoga's studios. This later prompted more women to come forward with allegations that they, too, were molested by an instructor. The yoga studio said in a statement in August 2020 that the instructor involved in the incident had agreed to go on leave after internal investigations, and that Trust Yoga was cooperating with the authorities on the matter. Singh will be back in court on July 15 for sentencing. His bail was also increased by S$10,000 on Thursday to S$25,000. The court heard that Singh had worked as a yoga instructor at Trust Yoga from April 1, 2019, and was on a two-year contract until March 31, 2021. In that time, Singh had molested the three women, who were aged between 24 and 29 at the time. Sometime in November 2019, Singh slapped the buttocks of his first victim while she was getting up from a yoga pose known as the forward bend. The victim felt \"disoriented, confused, angry and shocked\" when Singh touched her, the court heard. Despite this ordeal, she also continued to attend some of Singh’s classes as she wanted to “suppress the assault” and put the incident aside. She also contemplated raising the incident after the class, but ultimately decided not to as she was struggling to come to terms with it. In a separate incident occurring on two separate occasions between September 2019 and March 2020, Singh molested another victim while she was performing a yoga pose too. Likewise, the second victim continued with her lessons at the time of the incident as she had seen Singh doing the same to other students, who did not react. She thought at the time that this was just his “way of teaching”, the court heard. The victim only reflected upon these incidents when she subsequently read accounts of other girls online who had been through a similar situation, which convinced her that her experiences \"were not mere accidents as she had wanted to believe initially\". Later, on July 11, 2020, Singh molested his third victim by touching her private parts while she was in different yoga poses during a class. This was captured by a closed-circuit television (CCTV). Shocked and confused by his actions, the victim also did not immediately express her discomfort as she did not know how to react. But the truth came to light later when she spoke to a friend and her parents, and then informed Trust Yoga’s managers the next day, court documents stated. She made two police reports regarding the incident on July 13 and Aug 18 in 2020. The court also heard that the earlier two victims made police reports after that, following the posts by the third victim. The court also heard Singh was placed on leave of absence from Aug 3, 2020 following the accusations. In her oral judgement, District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz highlighted several inconsistencies in Singh's testimony, such as him claiming to have touched a victim’s thigh in court although he had told the police that he touched her hip. She noted that Singh himself stated during the trial that no yoga adjustments would necessitate touching a student’s private parts. Singh had also told the court that he was “very careful” not to touch his student’s private parts when making yoga adjustments, said the judge. Even though all three victims did not sound out their discomfort to Singh immediately, the judge said their evidence was not undermined by their non-actions at the time of the offences. “Our legal system recognises that each individual’s reaction to trauma is unique and personal,” said the judge. “Therefore, the absence of immediate confrontation should not be viewed as a marker of the credibility or veracity of a complainant’s claim.” She added that it is important the court does not assess evidence based on “preconceived notions of how a victim should act or react, or in (Singh’s) words, what ‘common sense’ dictates.” Singh had earlier testified in court that the victims' post-incident behaviour had \"notable lapses in common sense\" which affected their credibility. Addressing the three charges against Singh that were withdrawn, the judge said evidence from the fourth woman was incongruent with her allegations of molest. This evidence, which District Judge Sripathy-Shanaz described as “continued active, unsolicited and vocal support” of Singh, refers to several WhatsApp messages the woman had sent to vouch for the instructor. “This gives rise to reservations about the reliability of her narrative, notwithstanding her explanations in court, and ultimately constrains a finding that her testimony is unusually convincing,” said the judge. For each count of outrage of modesty, Singh faces up to two years’ jail, or fined with or without caning, or any combination of such punishments.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — When 61-year-old Khor Lian Huat noticed the dog he raised at his cousin's home in Pulau Ubin had a maggot-infested wound, he did not take it to the vet but instead used an antiseptic to clean the wound. Khor Lian Huat, 61, at the State Courts on May 17, 2024 along with a photograph of the wounded dog. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When 61-year-old Khor Lian Huat noticed the dog he raised at his cousin's home in Pulau Ubin had a maggot-infested wound, he did not take it to the vet but instead used an antiseptic to clean the wound. By the time the animal was taken to a vet by non-governmental organisation Save Our Street Dogs (SOSD), the paw was necrotising, that is the cells were dying, and the vet thought the paw would need to be amputated. On Friday (May 17), Khor was fined S$4,500 for unreasonably omitting to do an act which caused unnecessary pain and suffering to his dog. He was also barred from owning any pet for 12 months. Pleading for leniency, Khor told the court that he had not neglected his dog, and tried to help it by putting antiseptic on the wound. He also argued that the circumstances were different from other cases of neglect as his dog was on Pulau Ubin, a \"rural area... different from an urban (environment)\". However, the judge dismissed his claims and said that Khor should have known better by taking his dog to the vet when he noticed the wound was infested with maggots. Mr Lim Chong Hui, prosecutor for the National Parks Board (NParks), told the court that Khor, who lives most of the time on mainland Singapore, kept his dog and its nine puppies with his cousin, Ms Ho Beng Neo, who lived on Pulau Ubin. Sometime between July and August 2021, Khor visited the island and noticed a wound on his dog's paw. He cleaned the wound with an antiseptic and instructed his cousin to continue cleaning the dog's wound before he returned home. Mr Lim did not mention how the dog injured its paw, or why Khor had left his dog with Mr Ho on Pulau Ubin. When Khor visited the dog later — Mr Lim said this was \"probably one to two weeks later\" — Khor noticed that the wound had become bigger with maggots crawling in the wound. Instead of taking his pet to the vet, he cleaned the wound with an antiseptic and picked out the maggots. He then left the dog with his cousin and returned home. As the wound worsened, Ms Ho grew worried and asked friends and relatives for help. Khor's nephew then put Ms Ho in touch with volunteers from SOSD, who helped take the dog to a vet on mainland Singapore. By then, the dog's paw was necrotising and it had several open cavities with maggots. It also had “putrid brown discharge dripping” from the wound. While the vet expected to amputate the paw due to the severity of the wound, the dog was able to make a full recovery after it was warded for 10 days. SOSD reported the incident to the Animal and Veterinary Service, part of NParks, on Aug 26, 2021. The prosecutor sought a fine of S$5,000, arguing that Khor was \"well aware that his treatment of (his dog's) wounds was simply not working\". \"Any ordinary observer would know when they see maggots in a wound that they need to bring a pet to the vet,\" said Mr Lim. He added it was \"fortuitous\" that the dog's paw did not need to be amputated because Khor's cousin had found a way to seek help. The prosecutor also said that NParks had initially offered him a composition fine of S$1,000 and gave him five reminders to pay the fine. Khor pleaded for leniency, adding that he loves his dog \"like his own child\". He also said in Mandarin that he did not want to move the dog as it had given birth recently when it was injured, and it was \"eager to look after the pups\". However, District Judge Lorraine Ho noted he had not visited the dog while it was warded at the vet. \"When a person is sick, they need medical treatment even if they stay on Pulau Ubin. It's the same for pets as well,\" she said. \"It is the responsibility of every pet owner to ensure the health of their pets, regardless of where the pet is located.\" For unreasonably omitting to do an act which caused unnecessary pain and suffering to his dog, Khor faced up to 18 months' jail, a fine of up to S$15,000, or both. The offence also comes with a disqualification from owning pets for a period of time.

SINGAPORE — Some viewers apparently do not watch a full TikTok video before commenting, going by the negative reaction to an influencer's attempt to express his love for Singapore through tongue-in-cheek humour. In the video, Filipino-American Andre Carrillo, 28, who has more than 216,000 followers on TikTok, uses sarcasm to make various statements that are actually the opposite of how he feels about Singapore. He spells this out near the end of the video. The video that lasted slightly more than a minute was posted on Saturday (May 18) and it starts with Mr Carrillo saying that he would \"never go back to Singapore\". \"I hate how hawker centres are spread conveniently throughout the city making it that you never have to go too far for food,\" Mr Carrillo adds. This is while the video showcases contrasting clips of several hawker and restaurant meals he ate. Alongside clips of him kayaking in mangroves at Pulau Ubin, he says that everything in Singapore is \"man-made, (it is) literally the most artificial country I've stepped foot in\". As the video ends, Mr Carrillo says that he hopes viewers realise that he was being \"sarcastic\". \"This is why you'll never hear me say,\" Mr Carrillo said before the video repeats with him stating: \"I'll never come back to Singapore\". In the video description, Mr Carrillo wrote that he has visited Singapore five times and never gets bored with the country. \"Anytime I make a video about Singapore though, so many Singaporeans comment with things like 'I don’t see what’s so nice about Singapore and I live here',\" he continued \"The grass will always be greener on the other side, and for people like me who grew up in California, I can assure you there are tons of things I think Singapore does better than us; it might be the same feeling some Singaporeans get when visiting other places!\" Mr Carrillo's video has attracted more than 690 comments, with some missing the influencer's tongue-in-cheek humour, and apparently not getting as far as his reference to sarcasm. One commenter said that he agreed with Mr Carrillo's statements, taking them at face value: \"I'm always at (a loss) when my foreign friends ask me what to do in Singapore.\" To this, another online user pointed out Mr Carrillo was being sarcastic. Several others also made rude remarks about him, stating that he should keep quiet and not make rude comments about Singapore. Some also gave him suggestions on areas that he could visit during his next trip here. The majority of commenters, however, found Mr Carrillo's sarcasm to be humorous and they made their own jokes. \"I was about to attack,\" one said, seemingly ready to argue that Singapore is not a boring place. Another joked that Mr Carrillo nearly made the \"whole of Singapore\" angry towards him. One TikTok user commented that Mr Carrillo was welcome to visit Singapore and \"be sarcastic again\". Responding to queries from TODAY, Mr Carrillo said he thought his sarcasm would have been \"obvious\" since all the clips he used showed him having fun in Singapore. \"I also added so much information that I feel like someone who doesn't like Singapore wouldn't have included if they really didn't like (the country),\" he said, pointing to his comments about Singapore's cultural diversity as an example. Mr Carrillo did acknowledge he might have been \"a bit too sarcastic\" when he was talking about Singapore's local food scene. \"Perhaps I could have said something like 'there's no options' while showcasing the diverse food choices,\" he lamented. Nonetheless, Mr Carrillo added he is not upset that people misunderstood his humour. Rather, he is sad that some Singaporeans who did not watch his entire video might think he hates Singapore. \"I hope the algorithm brings them back to the many other videos I've already made about Singapore,\" he said. In a separate reply to a comment on his TikTok video, Mr Carrillo said he plans to visit Singapore again in July. Several social media videos about people's opinions on Singapore as a travel destination have gone viral in the past. In March, travel vlogger “ninas_travels” said that she would never visit Singapore again, annoying some Singaporeans. In this case, the vlogger meant what she wrote literally. Explaining her reasons in the video’s caption, the vlogger named Nina Gerhards said that Singapore is the \"most boring country (I have ever been to)”. The Instagram video has had more than 2.7 million views since it was published.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi died in office after a helicopter he was on crashed in the mountains near the Azerbaijan border, state media confirmed on Monday (May 20). This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi died in office after a helicopter he was on crashed in the mountains near the Azerbaijan border, state media confirmed on Monday (May 20). Iran is a key player in the Middle East and its politics have often had a ripple effect across the region. The 63-year-old Raisi, a hardline cleric, was elected president in 2021. While there has been concern that Raisi's death might spark political turmoil in Iran and the Middle East, experts told TODAY this is unlikely to play out in the Islamic state. TODAY takes a closer look at what happened and potential developments. Raisi, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking Iranian officials, were in a helicopter headed towards the Iranian city of Tabriz, where he was scheduled to inaugurate a project at an oil refinery. While en route, at about 1pm on Sunday (5.30pm Singapore time), the helicopter, a Bell 212 developed by the US in the 1960s, went down after a technical failure. Search and rescue teams were deployed to scour the area through heavy rain and fog. More than 10 hours later, the charred wreckage of the helicopter was found in a remote, mountainous area near the border with Azerbaijan. Iran's former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has since said that the United States had a part to play in the crash, as sanctions imposed by the superpower prevented Iran from purchasing newer aircraft. Prof Shahram Akbarzadeh, a research professor from Deakin University specialising in Middle East Politics, also noted in responses to queries from TODAY that Iran's air fleet is very old due to the sanctions. The sanctions, imposed in 1979, also means Iran is unable to purchase spare parts to maintain its ageing fleet of planes and helicopters, resulting in frequent air accidents. Mr Mohammad Mokhber, the first Vice President of Iran, has been appointed acting President until the country heads to the polls on June 28 to elect a new President. But political experts told TODAY there is unlikely to be any major changes to Iran's domestic policy. \"This will be an administrative hiccup as the administration figures out their day-to-day functions with the president and foreign minister out of the picture,\" said Prof Akbarzadeh. \"It may be administrative chaos, but there will not be a strategic change in domestic and international policy.\" Prof Mehran Kamrava of Georgetown University in Qatar added that Iran's foreign policy will likely remain the same too. While the late foreign minister Amir-Adollahian was the architect of Iran's 'good neighbors' and 'look East' policies, and an important and effective member of Raisi’s cabinet, it is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who ultimately directs Iran's foreign policy, said Prof Kamrava. But the regime may face challenges in getting a vote of confidence from voters come June. The country's previous election in March this year saw its worst voter turnout since Iran's founding in 1979. Out of the country's 61 million eligible voters, only 41 per cent turned out to the polls. \"The Supreme Leader has been on public record asking citizens to vote because the elections is seen as a sign of legitimacy,\" said Prof Akbarzadeh on the previous elections. \"Now asked again to choose another President... the outcome might be another slap in the face for the Islamic regime in terms of voter turnout.\" There are two possible scenarios that could play out from the deaths of Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian. The first scenario, and what experts deem is most likely, is that the crash will be declared an unfortunate accident. In this scenario, the impact on the country, the Middle Eastern region and the rest of the world is little to none. While Iran will have to deal with its upcoming elections, domestic and foreign policy will not see drastic change, if any at all. \"Any impact on Iran's relations with Singapore is likely to be minimal, at least in the short-term,\" said Prof Kamrava. \"Trade and relations between the two countries are not very extensive, and it is unlikely there will be major changes in their existing relationship.\" The second scenario is that Iran blames Israel for the accident, whether or not that may be true. The two countries have long butted heads. Most recently, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct 7 last year, Israel blamed Iran for its support of Hamas. After Israel attacked the Iranian consulate in Damascus, the capital of Syria, the Islamic Republic retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones in April. \"Given the close ties between Azerbaijan and Israel, and given that the crash occurred near the Iran-Azerbaijan border, it is possible that Tehran may declare that Israel was somehow responsible for the crash,\" said Dr Mark N. Katz, professor of government and politics at George Mason Univeristy's Schar School of Policy and Government. \"If so, then Iran will feel compelled to launch some sort of attack on Israel, and Israel will respond in kind.\" This might cause a \"prolonged, inconclusive conflict\" with some Middle Eastern states jumping into the fray. Sunni Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will likely seek to stay out of the conflict if this happens. But oil prices might rise, affecting the rest of the world and Singapore. But like other experts, Prof Akbarzadeh said this second scenario is highly unlikely. \"If by chance, Iranian authorities blame Israel, they would... be effectively declaring war on Israel. I don't think Iranian authorities would be interested in pursuing that line,\" he said. \"There has been no indication that the helicopter crash is due to foul play.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Thanking the stranger for making her day, the woman noted that such acts of kindness are \"hard to come by\". \"So when a stranger goes out of their way to help me it really tugs at my heartstrings,\" she wrote. She said that even when she was nine months pregnant, people often did not give up their seat — though she added that she did not expect them to as she would have taken a taxi if she needed a seat. At the end of her post, the woman asked other Reddit users to share their own stories and \"spread some kindness\". More than 130 comments were left under the woman's post. Most users described their encounters with good-hearted people, while others commended such random acts of kindness. These encounters included strangers going above and beyond, while others were of simple words of comfort — all of which left a lasting impression on these social media users. One user wrote about a driver for ride-hailing platform Grab who had left her some words of advice and a pack of tissues. She had been crying in her car after she broke up with her boyfriend who had cheated on her. \"At the end of the ride, he offered me a pack of tissues and sympathetically told me that 'tomorrow will be better',\" the person added. \"Although he’s a stranger and didn’t know what happened, his gesture really warmed my heart and it helped me more than he knew.\" Another user had a chance encounter with a man at Queen Street Bus Terminal. While waiting for a bus headed to Johor Bahru, Malaysia, he realised he did not have enough small change for the ride. \"I was asking around for change when this person just offered to give me the full amount for the ride without being paid back,\" the Reddit user said. \"He said that it happened to him before and he was paying it forward as someone had helped to pay for his trip in the past.\" While comments were mostly positive, some also lamented moments when they wished they had met someone who could have lent a helping hand. One said: \"Nobody offered to help when there was a SimplyGo card top-up error and the bus driver chased me off the bus. I was forced to walk for hours to get home.\" Regardless, the flood of stories touched the hearts of many social media users — with some calling for such posts to be more common on Reddit as a pick-me-up.

An aerial view of Choa Chu Kang Waterworks taken in 2019. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A worker died and two others are in intensive care after collapsing during a routine tank cleaning at Choa Chu Kang Waterworks on Thursday morning (May 23). In a statement on Thursday, national water agency PUB said that the three men are sub-contractors and were found unconscious at around 11.15am at Singapore's second-largest waterworks along Nanyang Drive. \"Preliminary investigations indicate that the workers had inhaled hydrogen sulphide, a gas produced from sludge which is a by-product of the water treatment process,\" PUB added. The agency said that all three workers were taken unconscious to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. One of them, a 40-year-old Indian national who worked as a cleaning operations manager, died in hospital. The other two, a pair of Malaysian general workers aged 24 and 39, were still in intensive care. Hydrogen sulphide is a colourless gas that is extremely flammable and highly toxic. It is known for its strong odour of rotten eggs. In response to CNA's queries, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that it is investigating the incident and has instructed PUB to stop all tank cleaning works. \"As a general safety measure, proper ventilation must be provided to prevent accumulation of toxic vapours,\" MOM said. \"Workers must also be protected from excessive exposure to toxic vapours by equipping them with gas monitoring devices, and the appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirator mask and breathing apparatus.\" PUB said that it is in touch with the contractors and will render support to the workers' family members. \"PUB expresses our deepest condolences to the deceased's family,\" the agency said. \"Safety and health at all our workplaces are of utmost importance to PUB. We will cooperate fully with the investigation. \"As a precaution, PUB has called a safety timeout for similar operations in confined spaces and is reviewing the associated safety measures.\" In response to TODAY's queries, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it was alerted to the incident at about 11.25am on Thursday. \"SCDF firefighters and HazMat (Hazardous Material) specialists wearing personal protective equipment, including breathing apparatus sets, entered the premises and identified the presence of a hazardous vapour — hydrogen sulphide.\" Two water jets were used to disperse the vapour. The three workers were unconscious en route to the hospital and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had to be performed on one of them. SCDF did not state if the worker who died was the same one who received CPR. No hydrogen sulphide was detected at the site after the water jets were used for an hour, SCDF added.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — In hopes of breaking up its alleged monopoly on the live concert industry in the United States, the country's Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation. American pop singer Taylor Swift performing during a concert in Sydney, Australia on Feb 23, 2024 as part of The Eras Tour. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — In hopes of breaking up its alleged monopoly on the live concert industry in the United States, the country's Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and parent company Live Nation. The 128-page antitrust lawsuit was joined by 29 US state and district attorneys general on Thursday (May 23), alleging that Live Nation and Ticketmaster used anti-competitive practices that have stifled the concert and ticketing industry. The US government alleges that the anti-competitive practices have resulted in concert-goers facing high ticket prices and has prohibited innovation and competition. Through the lawsuit, the US hopes that Live Nation will be ordered to divest \"at minimum\" Ticketmaster and cease any anti-competition behaviour. US lawmakers have long accused Live Nation of engaging in such practices. Early last year, a congressional hearing was held on issues that fans faced while trying to buy tickets for pop singer Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour. Fans in Singapore also encountered similar problems . In response to the civil suit on Thursday, Mr Dan Wall, executive vice-president of corporate and regulatory affairs at Live Nation, said that the lawsuit does not address problems in the concert and ticketing industry, and wrongfully targets Live Nation and Ticketmaster. \"It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from rising production costs, to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary ticket prices,\" Mr Wall wrote in a blog on the company's website. He added that the lawsuit is \"anti-business\". Does Live Nation own a monopoly, and how will this lawsuit affect Singapore's ticketing and concert scheme? Live Nation is essentially a one-stop shop for live entertainment — it provides promotional services, has ticketing services through Ticketmaster and owns several performance venues. The US government has accused Live Nation of dominating the industry through what IT called a \"self-reinforcing 'flywheel'\". If venues did not use Ticketmaster's services, they risked losing access to Live Nation-managed performances and tours — which can be a costly mistake. Celebrities such as rapper Post Malone have had their concerts produced by Live Nation, while pop stars Taylor Swift and Beyonce have had their sold-out tours promoted by the entertainment giant. It is not just the venues — the complaint alleged that performers also had to use Live Nation's promotional services or they would not be able to perform at their venues. This ecosystem allegedly made it increasingly expensive for industry competitors. And with a lack of competition, the US claimed that Ticketmaster had no incentive to invest into its systems. Lacking competition also means that Live Nation could charge consumers several fees — which the lawsuit called \"Ticketmaster Tax\" — such as service fees, facility fees, payment processing fees and more. \"These strategies are part of a deliberate and defensive series of actions and decisions designed to lock up venues, lock out competitors, and hold the industry hostage from innovation and evolution,\" the US said in its lawsuit. In 2010, the US Department of Justice approved a merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster but with several conditions to ensure that the conglomerate would not act anti-competitively. The antitrust decree was to ensure that Live Nation could not retaliate against a venue for using another ticketing service besides Ticketmaster, among other things. After the merger, Live Nation grew to become, in its own words, the \"largest live entertainment company in the world\". It was accused of anti-competitive behaviour in 2019 by the US Justice Department, but it reached a settlement that was not disclosed. In the latest lawsuit, it was stated that Live Nation manages more than 400 musical artists and controls 265 concert venues in North America, including more than 60 of the top 100 amphitheatres in the US. Through Ticketmaster, it controls about 80 per cent of major concert venues' ticketing for concerts. Live Nation reported on May 3 that revenue rose 21 per cent to US$3.8 billion (S$5.13 billion) for the first quarter ended March 31 this year. This was well above earlier estimates of US$3.26 billion. Even though facts and figures such as these have spurred US legislators to describe the entertainment giant as an monopoly, it disagrees. Mr Wall of Live Nation said on Thursday that it does not derive its profits from \"monopoly pricing\", stating that the company's service charges are no higher than other ticketing sites such as SeatGeek and AXS. \"In fact, when Ticketmaster loses a venue to SeatGeek, service charges usually go up substantially,\" Mr Wall added. \"And even accounting for sponsorship, an advertising business that helps keep ticket prices down, Live Nation’s overall net profit margin is at the low end of profitable S&P 500 companies.\" The S&P 500 is a list of the country's top 500 companies. Depending on the outcome of the US Department of Justice lawsuit, concert-goers here could be affected. If the outcome resulted in greater industry competition, this could pressure Ticketmaster to charge less for its services, which could mean that performing artistes are in a position to charge lower ticket prices for concert-goers. Dr Hannah Chang, an associate professor of marketing at the Singapore Management University, said that should the lawsuit result in the need for concerts to engage several ticketing platforms, it might be more complicated for concert-goers to buy tickets. This could also hurt artistes. \"Such issues are likely to be limited for megastars like Taylor Swift or Jay Chou where their fans will find a way (to buy their tickets),\" she added. \"For others — and particularly for emerging artistes — there may be benefits to being able to reach global audiences through one single platform, rather than through a mixture of platforms. \"For instance, if each concert uses a different platform, ticketing processes across languages and currencies are likely to be harder to standardise.\" The impact of the lawsuit might be limited here though — Live Nation's hold on the Singapore concert industry is arguably smaller than in the US. For one thing, it does not own any venue in Singapore, unlike in the US. While it is unclear if Ticketmaster has exclusive rights to provide its services at any venues, it does not have exclusivity for Singapore's National Stadium and Indoor Stadium, which have capacities of 55,000 and 12,000 respectively. A 2019 press release stated that it is one of three ticketing agents allowed to operate at the locations. The other two ticketing agents are Sistic and Australia's Ticketek. Ultimately, the impact will depend on the lawsuit's outcome — which could take years.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A painful family incident back in 2017 fuelled an interest in the plight of migrant workers for Singaporean director Chiang Wei Liang, whose debut film on these workers just won global recognition at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Back then, when his aunt called him out of the blue asking for a spare set of keys for her flat, Chiang knew that something was amiss despite his aunt's calm voice. He learnt that his uncle, who was locked inside his home, had collapsed from a stroke while she was at work. Since she was not home, paramedics could not open the house gate. Unable to find the keys in his family home or his grandparents' home in the same housing block, Chiang rushed to his aunt's home while another relative headed to the nearby market to find a locksmith. When he arrived, he was greeted by a terrifying, chaotic situation — paramedics were shouting instructions through the flat's locked gates as his uncle lay motionless on the floor and their young domestic worker from Myanmar knelt by his uncle's side, rubbing his hands. \"The young girl didn't know what to do because she spoke little English. By all accounts, she was very attentive and responsible, having worked for my aunt for three years,\" Chiang, now 37, said in a video-call interview with TODAY. \"Although she was relied on to take care of my uncle who had suffered a stroke before, she was not trusted enough to own a set of keys. And that lack of trust had consequences.\" Paramedics finally gained access to the flat but the stroke left his uncle bedridden. Chiang, who has been mainly Taiwan-based for more than 15 years, was in Singapore at the time to become a caregiver for his sick mother and sister when the incident occurred. The incident left him thinking about the relative trust that the family had placed in him compared to that in the domestic worker. Later, while back in Taiwan working on a film, Chiang met a group of migrant workers moonlighting as caregivers for the old in the rural areas of Taiwan. The similarities between them and his aunt’s helper in Singapore struck a chord — and he made it the centre of his debut feature film, Mongrel. The two-hour film is centred around the character Oom, played by Thai actor Wanlop Rungkumjad. Oom is a Thai illegal worker who becomes a caregiver to a sick elderly woman and her handicapped son in the Taiwan mountains. As Oom struggles under the unreasonable demands of his exploitative boss, he is forced to choose between dignity and survival. The sombre film not only premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in France last month — it was also awarded the Camera d’Or Special Mention. The Camera d'Or recognises the best first feature film at Cannes, while the special mention is for films that do not win the main prize but deserve recognition. It is not awarded every year and was last given out in 2009. A film critic from Britain's newspaper The Guardian last month gave the film four stars out of five, saying it is a \"Zen-like tale of compassion and suffering among migrant care workers\". In 2013, Singaporean film Ilo Ilo became the first film to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival when it clinched the Camera d’Or. Although Mongrel may be the first Singapore film to get a special mention, Chiang admitted that his first reaction to learning of the award was concern about where to get outfits at short notice for his parents who were attending the ceremony. Mongrel's producer Lai Wei Jie, 41, a Singaporean, told TODAY on Thursday (June 20): \"We were definitely more excited about the film being selected for Cannes (than winning). \"There’s no better place for Mongrel… I cried while watching the premiere, even though I watched it at least 100 times before. It’s different (watching) it on the big screen.\" While filming a scene mirroring the medical emergency that Chiang’s uncle went through, a man living near the filming site had a cardiac arrest. As they were in a rural mountainous area of Taiwan, the ambulance took 45 minutes to arrive. Emergency medical technicians hired to act in the film rushed to the man's aid, but he could not be saved. After the incident, filming resumed — capturing the raw emotions of the emergency medical technicians as they acted out a scene that almost mirrored the real-world drama that had played out minutes earlier. The stark similarity left some of the crew shaken as they witnessed first-hand that Mongrel was more than a film — it was reality. This essence of reality is captured in every detail in the film, the director and producers told TODAY. The film was set in the mountains, for example, because these rural areas are where illegal migrant caregivers are heavily relied on to care for older residents living hours away from the nearest healthcare facility, Chiang explained. The mountains are also where immigrants hide when they run away from their exploitative employers. Chiang said that he also chose a Thai immigrant as the main character to pay homage to the Thais being the first foreign workers allowed to work in Taiwan in 1991. When it came to casting, Chiang, Lai and co-producer Elizabeth Wijaya, 40, a Singapore permanent resident, said that they wanted the role of Hui, the handicapped man cared for by Oom, to be acted by a person with disabilities. This was because Hui was the “emotional core” of the film, and they wanted an actor who could relate strongly. To do so, they scoured Taiwan for an actor who was conscientious, could take directions, take part in acting workshops and commit to the gruelling production schedule. They eventually cast Mr Kuo Shu-wei, a Taiwanese man with cerebral palsy who teaches other people with disabilities to use technology to communicate. Despite his lack of acting experience, he quickly picked up some techniques from an acting coach on set. Chiang also told TODAY that directing Mongrel would not have been possible without Lai and Wijaya’s help. The duo runs development and production company E&W Films. \"They are artisans (who are) willing to take on a film like Mongrel… you need to be gutsy and courageous enough to create this kind of film,\" Chiang said. With reality so closely captured in the feature film, Chiang admitted that he struggled to understand the impact of the film, and wondered if there will be any impact at all. Throughout his career, Chiang's films have often circled around the social issues of the Southeast Asian diaspora . His 2017 short film Nyi Ma Lay is about foreign domestic workers in Singapore, while his 2018 VR film Only The Mountain Remains is about immigrants running away to Taiwan's mountains. As the years went on, he got somewhat frustrated that little has been done to address the exploitation of Southeast Asian labour globally. \"This is the biggest question that I have had, to sum up my career of 15 years. What can I do, or what can the film do,\" he said, noting that legislative change still holds the biggest impact. “A filmmaker receiving a prize at the most prestigious (film) festival in the world. Great. But what does the film do?” Grappling with this, Chiang plans to take a break before he finds the next subject to spotlight in in his future work. He also hopes to mentor a future generation of film-makers in Taiwan and Singapore. What’s next for Lai and Wijaya? The couple are working to have Mongrel screened in Singapore, and are producing two other films at E&W Films. They did not share more details on the films. And if Mongrel makes it to cinemas here, they hope that the audience will spend time pondering the marginalisation of migrant workers and the stressors of caregiving. Wijaya noted that the film at least has an impact among audience members who watched the premiere at the Director's Fortnight at Cannes — the only section that allows the public to buy a ticket to watch films. Some viewers told Chiang that they could relate to the caregiver's woes. Wijaya said: \"Legislative change is important to address these issues but so is movements of the heart. A film can also be about convincing certain feelings and emotions.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Mourners attend the burial ceremony of Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril on Tuesday (April 23). She was one of the two victims who died in the Tampines accident on April 22, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When retiree Mohamed Kassim Yusoff learnt of a multi-vehicle accident involving his son-in-law in Tampines on Monday (April 22), he did not know that his precious granddaughter was also in the car. It was only at Changi General Hospital when visiting his son-in-law Muhammad Azril Mahmood that the doctor attending to him dropped the “bombshell” that broke his heart. He found out that 17-year-old Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril was also involved in the accident, and she had not made it. “I was stunned. When did Afifah come in (to this)?” said Mr Kassim, 71, with tears welling in his eyes. Eight people were taken to hospital after the accident at the junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Tampines Avenue 4 on Monday morning. Afifah and a 57-year-old woman, both unconscious, were among the eight but died in hospital. Afifah's death came just a day after Mr Kassim had met her at their weekly family gathering on Sunday, and only three months after they had celebrated their birthdays — which both fall in January — together. Mr Kassim spoke to TODAY on Tuesday morning outside Afifah’s family home in Pasir Ris where more than 100 family and friends gathered to bid their final farewell to the Temasek Junior College student. “She’s very dedicated to what she’s doing… Her favourite subject was science, and she wanted badly to be a doctor,” said Mr Kassim, who said he was very close to the teen. The oldest of three siblings, Afifah was described by friends and family as a dedicated and intelligent student with an infectious personality who always put her schoolwork first. When it came to holidays and family hangouts, these plans had to align with the timetable she had made for herself. “We can go anywhere in the world — but if she says she’s got to study, (then) she’s got to study,” said Mr Kassim. Indeed, the former Cedar Girls’ Secondary School student had always set high expectations for herself. When Afifah got her GCE O-Level results last year, her grand uncle, 70-year-old retiree Mydin Mohamed, said that she had been in tears despite doing well — as she had not made the cut-off point for junior colleges she had aimed for. “She strives to work hard, she really goes for it… We miss her,” said Mr Mydin, who described Afifah as a diligent and disciplined “high achiever”. Afifah’s grandfather also felt that she was mature beyond her years, and that it was evident even in her preschool days, where she preferred to speak to her teachers. “The teachers would ask: ‘Why don’t you play with your friends?’, and (she would say): ‘They’re like babies!’,” he said. “She’s very mature. I expected her to do good things in life.” In her short-lived junior college days, Afifah was also actively involved in the Malay Cultural Society. Ms Elina Abdul Rashid, the club’s teacher-in-charge at Temasek JC, said Afifah was enthusiastic and positive. “Afifah was very passionate about Malay culture and whenever she is around, peers always seem to be happy as she always brings with her much laughter and happiness,” Ms Elina said in a post on Temasek JC’s Facebook page on Tuesday morning. On Monday, Mr Azril, who is in his late 40s, had dropped off his wife for work at Park View Primary School, before taking one of Afifah’s younger sisters to school at Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School. Mr Azril had then intended to drop Afifah off at Temasek Polytechnic, where she was due to participate in a cross-country event organised by her school, before the accident occurred at around 7am. Mr Kassim said that Afifah usually sits in the front passenger seat of the car but, for whatever reason, did not that day. “If she sat in front with the seat belt, probably the injury would be lesser and she can survive. That very day she chose to sit behind. I don’t know why.” Just moments after the incident, 45-year-old petroleum technician Muhammad Rosman Abdul Razak found himself face-to-face with a dazed Mr Azril, who was stuck in the driver’s seat of his overturned vehicle. Speaking to reporters at the void deck underneath Afifah’s home after offering his condolences to the teen's mother, Mr Rosman said he was on his way to drop his 16-year-old daughter off at Tampines Secondary School on Monday, and was about two cars behind Mr Azril’s when the incident happened “directly in front of our eyes”. He swiftly parked his car and rushed on to the scene to find Mr Azril just about regaining consciousness. Mr Rosman had asked him about his well-being and if he could feel his arms and legs, but said Mr Azril kept asking him to check on his daughter instead. “My daughter, my daughter is at the back,” Mr Rosman recounted Mr Azril as saying. Unable to see anyone in the back of the car, Mr Rosman focused his efforts on pulling Mr Azril out of the vehicle and eventually succeeded. Moments later, he found Afifah under some pieces of debris. “Unfortunately I couldn’t save her, she was already gasping for air and there was blood in her mouth.” Although he tried to talk to her constantly, Afifah was not able to respond to Mr Rosman, who is trained in providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). “I was very helpless, because I am trained in CPR and I couldn’t do it,\" he said, explaining that he might have made her predicament worse if he had done so. According to family members, Mr Azril is currently under observation with kidney and spine related injuries, and is conscious in the hospital. Staff and alumni members and even juniors at Cedar Girls’ Secondary School are saddened by Afifah’s death, said the school. Dr Nuraini Ismail, year head at Cedar Girls’, told TODAY that former students reached out to her as well as to each other on Monday night to share the sad news and to “pacify each other”. Some of Afifah’s juniors studying in Cedar Girls’ were also “very affected”, as she was supposed to return to the school next week to teach them some basic Girls’ Guides drills. The school said they were reaching out to the students to lend support and are encouraging them to write letters as an avenue to express their feelings. “One of them actually wrote saying: ‘You (Afifah) promised to see me next week, but things just sometimes don't happen’.” Dr Nuraini, who was Afifah’s year head during the first two years in Cedar Girls’ and also her Higher Mother Tongue teacher, also described her as a “very respectful” student. She remembers fondly her former student’s “infectious” laughter and positivity, which the teacher credited as one of the factors that led to Afifah’s batchmates being “particularly close” to one another. Dr Nuraini also recalled how Afifah had really wanted to enter a junior college and become a student councillor. Her former teachers were “very happy” for her when she achieved those dreams, though they are now short-lived. “We all feel that there's so much joy and optimism and positivity and potential (in Afifah) that has been stolen from us.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

SINGAPORE — A 42-year-old driver who is allegedly linked to a fatal traffic accident in Tampines earlier this week has been arrested for dangerous driving causing death, the police said on Wednesday (April 24). In response to media queries, the police said that the man had been discharged from the hospital on Wednesday and was later placed under arrest. TODAY understands that the man was driving a black Saab that was caught on video speeding and beating a red light at the junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Tampines Avenue 4 on Monday. The police added that his driving licence has been suspended with immediate effect and that investigations are ongoing. The accident, which occurred at around 7am on Monday, involved six vehicles and resulted in the deaths of a 17-year-old girl and a 57-year-old woman. Six others were also taken to hospital. The deceased teenager was identified as Temasek Junior College student Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril , who was in the back passenger seat of her father’s car when the Saab collided into their vehicle. Afifah had been on her way to Temasek Polytechnic to take part in a cross-country event organised by her school. Her father, Police Coast Guard inspector Muhammad Azril Mahmood, underwent surgery on Monday for the injuries he sustained, according to a Facebook post by his brother-in-law Firdaus Kassim, a football coach. The 57-year-old woman was identified as Norzihan Juwahib, who worked at pest control firm First Choice Pest Specialist. Both Afifah and Norzihan were buried at the Pusara Aman Muslim cemetery on Tuesday.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — Whenever I had expressed any inkling of nervousness or fear throughout my life, the people close to me always echoed the same piece of sound advice: Slow deep breaths. Fill up your lungs with air, hold it there, exhale slowly. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — Whenever I had expressed any inkling of nervousness or fear throughout my life, the people close to me always echoed the same piece of sound advice: Slow deep breaths. Fill up your lungs with air, hold it there, exhale slowly. Then do it again, and again, until you feel some semblance of calm and control. For the most part, even though the anxious jitters that come with uncomfortable situations never disappear completely, such slow, methodological breathing undoubtedly makes me feel better. Thus the idea that how we breathe affects how we feel always seemed plain and obvious. Indeed, clinical psychologists to whom I spoke agreed that our breathing patterns have a direct connection to our emotional state and mental well-being. Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at the psychological consultancy Mind What Matters, said: “The way we breathe can activate physical changes in the body that can enhance stress, but it can also be one of the fastest ways to feel better emotionally.” That is why mental health professionals coach their clients to pace their breathing frequency in order to manage their overwhelming anxiety, anger or panic. Yet after almost three decades of living, I had somehow not given any thought to how else breathing could enrich our lives or help us manage its many tribulations. So when my colleague asked if I wanted to attend two sessions of “breathwork” — where we consciously control our breathing to influence our mental, emotional or physical state — I saw it as a chance to expand my understanding of this quotidian bodily function that we perform so naturally, yet know so little about. I was laid out on a yoga mat in a cosy room with ambient music, alongside seven other participants and a trained breathwork instructor guiding us through what is known as the “Wim Hof method”. We started with slow deep breaths, inhaling deep into our lungs and our bellies before picking up the pace and eventually exhaling every bit of air out. After holding my breath for about 40 seconds, my arms and legs were tingling from a lack of oxygen. Yet, I felt a deep, blue sense of calm. Developed by a Dutchman who coined the breathing technique after his own name, it is said to provide one with more energy, reduce one’s stress levels, and instigate an augmented immune response that swiftly deals with disease-causing organisms. After the session, my instructor, Mr Tan Chun Yih, said: “Being able to dive into these states within a few minutes gives the body a very enlarged bandwidth of understanding what stress and relaxation feels like. “And the common result of a round of breathwork is you come up feeling a lot more relaxed because of the rollercoaster of stress that we put ourselves through.” On the official \"Wim Hof method\" breathing website, the proper steps to attempt this breathing method are as follows: Play around with the number of breaths, the tempo at which you breathe and the number of cycles, until you find a routine that works best for you. Mr Tan, who has been a Wim Hof method instructor since 2019, said the method is also appealing because its benefits can be obtained in 12 to 15 minutes “within one breathing cycle”. Indeed, throughout the two-hour-long session, I felt intricately aware of my bodily sensations, and relaxed to the point where sleep seemed to be attainable in a snap. While Wim Hof’s breathing exercises alone claim to provide a whole host of advantages, they are meant to be done alongside cold exposure — a practice which in itself has gained traction for purportedly increasing one’s alertness and resilience, even helping with depression and anxiety. And so after our breathwork session was over, my fellow participants and I took turns dipping ourselves into an ice bath, where we practised the same breath holds and breathing rhythms to help us tide through the cold. “Breathwork is a good primer for stress management and relaxation,” Mr Tan said. “When we jump into cold water, the same stress comes in, yet the participant already knows how to manage their breath, manage their emotions and go through the next set of benefits that cold water exposure will bring.” In that very room two weeks later, I tried a different type of breathing exercise — one that required me to hyperventilate for an extended period of time. The practice is known as holotropic breathing, which purports to bring people into “altered states of consciousness” in order to provide an avenue for people to “heal” by releasing deep-rooted emotions. All around me, I heard my fellow participants breathe in and out heavily, at times making noises that seemed almost primal. I tried my best to keep up with the fast-paced breathing patterns throughout the session, but my body would tense up quickly and a stinging ache would emerge in the back of my head each time I did so. Ms Priscilla Shin, principal psychotherapist at Range Counselling Services, said that the way we breathe can influence the \"autonomic nervous system\", which controls functions such as heart rate and digestion. Deep breathing typically activates what is known as the \"parasympathetic\" nervous system, which helps with relaxation and reduces stress. On the other hand, rapid or shallow breathing tends to activate the \"sympathetic\" nervous system, contributing to increased stress or anxiety, Ms Shin added. This would explain the sense of calm I felt with the deep breaths of the Wim Hof method, and the uncomfortable physical symptoms I experienced with the shallow fast-paced nature of holotropic breathing. “Ultimately, controlled breathing can be a powerful tool for managing stress, regulating emotions and promoting mental well-being,” Ms Shin said. It is important to note that experts caution against trying the above breathing practices without first speaking to a healthcare professional and understanding the risks involved. Both the Wim Hof and holotropic breathing methods currently lack extensive scientific research to back up their purported benefits, Ms Shin said, adding that they are not recommended as a replacement for conventional mental health treatments. Instead, mental health experts recommend mindful breathing exercises and meditation, which have been demonstrated in scientific research to improve emotion processing. Ms Liew Shi Min, director and clinical psychologist of Heartscape Psychology, said that this would improve our tolerance of distressing emotions, help us accept uncontrollable, difficult situations, and enhance our daily problem-solving skills. “In addition, it helps with training our attention to focus on the present moment, which is fundamental to being intentional with how we use our time and energy.” Here are some other recommended breathing techniques that psychologists recommend we can use on a day-to-day basis: 1. Diaphragmatic Breathing Also known as \"belly breathing\" or \"deep breathing\", this technique involves breathing deeply into the diaphragm rather than shallowly into the chest. To practise, sit or lie down comfortably, place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your chest. Breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your belly to rise, then exhale slowly through your mouth, letting your belly fall. 2. The 4-7-8 Breathing This technique is a simple pattern that can be calming. Inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of seven, and then exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of eight. Repeat several times to help induce relaxation and calmness. 3. Box Breathing This method, also known as \"square breathing\", is used to create a balanced rhythm. This structured breathing pattern can help reduce stress and anxiety. Inhale through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, exhale through your mouth for a count of four, and then hold again for a count of four.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — The promise of a European Union (EU) citizenship and a better life for her 12-year-old son was enough for one domestic worker in Singapore to part with S$2,500 of her life savings to a recruitment agency in Singapore in 2022. Global Recruiters Pte Ltd occupies half a shop lot at Lucky Plaza shopping centre, seen here on May 3, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The promise of a European Union (EU) citizenship and a better life for her 12-year-old son was enough for one domestic worker in Singapore to part with S$2,500 of her life savings to a recruitment agency in Singapore in 2022. The agency promised to help her get a work permit and an official visa from the Polish embassy. The plan would then be to work as a cleaner at a factory in Poland for five years, apply to be a permanent resident there, then start a new life with her son in central Europe. That plan never materialised. Although the agency assured the domestic worker back in 2022 that her work permit would arrive in four to six months, nearly two years have passed without any progress. She eventually asked for a refund, but was denied. Like other migrant workers interviewed by TODAY, she spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the agency and her current employers. She said: “I feel very sad. It’s like you throw S$2,500 into the trash bin.” She is still hoping to find another route to Europe, but said that her main concern now is simply to get her money back. TODAY spoke to her and three other migrant workers in Singapore who went through a similar experience with the same recruitment agency, Global Recruiters. TODAY has reached out to Global Recruiters, but its managing director has declined multiple requests for an interview. Organisations championing migrant worker rights said that they have received several complaints about Global Recruiters and other organisations that offer this same service. The Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (Home) said that they typically receive around 10 complaints from migrant workers each year related to this matter. Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) said that five migrant workers approached them regarding this same issue last year. \"It is appalling to hear of these agencies targeting low-wage migrant workers, where the workers are offered false hope of a better working life only for their savings to be robbed,” Home said. “Migrant workers are incredibly dependent on intermediaries and thus will continue to be highly vulnerable to questionable business practices.\" Home added that it hopes law enforcement agencies will strengthen transnational cooperation to crack down on “networks that prey on the vulnerable and financially desperate”, and that there will be increased transparency in recruitment regimes for migrant workers. In response to TODAY’s queries, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that it is looking into two fee-related complaints filed against Global Recruiters in June last year and investigations are ongoing. The police here have also confirmed that reports against Global Recruiters have been made and that they are investigating. In April 2019, Global Recruiters created a Facebook page called “Pinoys to Poland” and posted a message stating that it was recruiting English-speaking Filipinos for Polish housekeeping jobs. The sales pitch to these migrant workers was simple: For a fee of around S$2,000, the company said that it would offer support for the applicant’s work permit, visa application and job placement in Poland. Once they had worked there for five years, they would be able to apply for permanent residency that, if approved, would allow them to invite their family members over to Poland to live under a family reunification visa. Permanent residents there would also be able to tap the country’s free education system and apply to be a Polish citizen, among other benefits. These benefits are accurate, as stated in both Polish and EU regulations. However, whether recruitment agencies are able to help migrants attain them is another matter. The Facebook group attracted the attention of migrant workers of other nationalities who are working in Singapore. For John (not his real name), a South Asian worker in his 30s who has worked here since the early 2010s, the appeal of Global Recruiters’ offer was the opportunity to start his life anew as a citizen in another country with his family. “Singapore is a very good country. Thirteen years I (have) lived here, but even if I stay another 10 years… I cannot progress to (attain an) S-Pass or bring my family over (here),” he said, referring to the S-Pass that is issued by MOM to eligible skilled workers earning a salary of at least $3,150. He has paid a total of S$3,500 to the recruitment agency over two years. He was refused a refund on the grounds that all the money paid had already been spent on his work permit and visa applications. Based on checks online, the cost of applying for a work permit in Poland for foreigners is 100 zloty (S$34), and the cost of obtaining a long-term Polish visa is about S$120. TODAY understands that there are at least 20 other migrant workers of various nationalities who have paid for the agency’s services to secure a job in Poland, but they are still on Singapore soil. They have been waiting anywhere between one and more than three years. The address listed on the “Pinoys to Poland” Facebook page is a unit in Lucky Plaza shopping centre. The unit was shut when TODAY visited the premises on two occasions this week, with the signboard above its entrance indicating that it is a pharmacy. Lucky Plaza’s store directory listed Global Recruiters in a different unit on the same floor, but that unit was empty of furniture. All four migrant workers who spoke to TODAY said that it was common for them to receive assurances from the agency that their work permits or visas were “coming soon”, only for these to be followed by months of radio silence. In the terms of a “consultancy agreement” that all four migrant workers signed with Global Recruiters that were seen by TODAY, the company indicated that it “cannot be held liable for any WP (work permit) application delays or rejection”. The agreement also states that “applicants will not be allowed to cancel an application once the application is made”, and that agency fees paid to Global Recruiters will be forfeited if an applicant is “unable to continue”. John and another migrant worker said that they had held out hope for many months because they knew of one previous applicant who had managed to go to Poland with Global Recruiters' help. Now, they have since come to believe that the same is not happening for them. In the meantime, some applicants received just a work permit from a provincial government in Poland. Adam (not his real name), a migrant worker of South Asian nationality in his 30s, forked out around S$5,000 in payments to the agency over a year, but received only a work permit that expired before he could even get an interview with the Polish embassy in Singapore for a visa. He told TODAY that he earns just slightly more than S$1,000 a month and is the sole breadwinner for his wife and two-year-old daughter. He added that his wife had to sell the cattle her family owned in order to pay for the agency’s fees back in 2021. “I am very sad and depressed,” he said. The workers interviewed by TODAY said that when they raised complaints with Global Recruiters or spoke about legal action, they had received threats in return. One was told that their employer would be contacted. In another instance, Global Recruiters filed a complaint at the Small Claims Tribunal against the worker, but then did not send a representative to the hearing, so the case was dismissed. Migrant workers’ rights group TWC2 said that it offered legal assistance to the second worker. MOM told TODAY that under the Employment Agencies Act 1958, organisations and individuals who place jobseekers with employers within or outside of Singapore must obtain an employment agency licence to operate in Singapore. “Jobseekers are reminded that they should not pay fees to their employment agencies until they are successfully emplaced with an employer,” MOM added. Global Recruiters is listed as a licensed employment agency, as seen on MOM’s online employment agency directory at the time of publication. All of this has been happening while Poland is mired in an immigration corruption scandal. In September last year, Polish media published reports alleging that Polish officials in Warsaw and abroad had fast-tracked work visas for non-EU migrant workers in developing countries in exchange for sums of money up to US$5,000 (S$6,800). In Eurostat data provided by Rzeczpospolita, a Polish news daily, Poland issued almost two million work visas from 2020 to 2023. These include 600,000 in 2020, more than a quarter of the total in the 27-member EU that year. Poland’s foreign ministry said in September last year that it would terminate all contracts for outsourcing companies that had handled visa applications since 2011, British news channel BBC reported. For the migrant workers in Singapore who find themselves stuck in a situation being driven by forces far beyond their control, the only thing that matters now is getting their hard-earned money back. John said: \"If you spend money on something, of course you want (some) benefits, right? If (they) really can't do anything, then (they should) return back my money. \"This was a very big mistake in my life.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has informed President Tharman Shanmugaratnam of his intent to resign from office on Wednesday (May 15) and hand over the reins to Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. In a letter addressed to Mr Tharman on Monday, Mr Lee said that his government will also resign on the same day. Mr Lee advised Mr Tharman to invite Mr Wong, \"who commands the confidence of the majority of Members of Parliament (MPs)\", to form the next government. Responding in a letter, Mr Tharman said that he concurred with Mr Lee’s advice and intends to appoint Mr Wong as Prime Minister on Wednesday. The exchange of letters were released by the Prime Minister's and President's offices on Monday. According to a separate press statement issued by the President’s Office on Monday, Mr Wong has accepted Mr Tharman’s invitation to form the next government, and has submitted to him a list of the proposed members of his government. In his letter, Mr Lee, who turned 72 in February, wrote that he had originally planned to hand over to a successor by the time he turned 70, but those plans had been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. “After the pandemic, we carried out a process to choose my successor. “On 14 April 2022, the PAP MPs met and unanimously endorsed Mr Lawrence Wong as the person to succeed me. Now, two years on, he is ready to lead Singapore. “I now formally advise you to invite Mr Lawrence Wong, who commands the confidence of the majority of Members of Parliament, to form the next government.” In his response, Mr Tharman thanked Mr Lee for “four decades of selfless service in government” which included two decades as the nation’s Prime Minister. Alongside creating a more diversified economy, Mr Tharman credited Mr Lee with setting the nation on a “path towards climate sustainability”, and earning Singapore “a unique standing in the world”. “Your tenure as Prime Minister was marked by crises which shook the world, in particular the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic,” he wrote. “You gave our people the confidence to see through each crisis, while staying united. You steered a nation to emerge not just intact but stronger and more resilient.” Mr Tharman also noted in his letter that Mr Wong intends to appoint Mr Lee as Senior Minister moving forward. “Your experience and advice will I am sure benefit the new leadership team as they chart the next phase of our history and make an even better Singapore.” In a separate letter addressed to Mr Wong, who turns 52 in December, Mr Tharman said that he has \"every confidence that as Prime Minister, you will lead Singapore with honour and ensure the continued stability and vitality of our nation\". Mr Wong will receive his instrument of appointment and take his Oath of Allegiance and Oath of Due Execution of Office at the Istana on Wednesday.

Ms Zhang posted on Instagram a side-by-side comparison of her photo (right) and part of an artwork (left) by Mr Dieschburg. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A Singaporean photographer has achieved a significant legal victory in Europe after suing an artist based in Luxembourg for copying her work in an award-winning painting, according to local media reports. The photographer, Zhang Jingna, 36, wrote on her social media pages last Friday (May 10) that her successful lawsuit “means a lot — not just for me but also for artists and photographers everywhere”. “It’s a reminder that copyright protects individuals from those that try to profit off our work without consent,” she said, in identical posts on X and Instagram. Ms Zhang, who is based in the United States, first photographed South Korean model Ji Hye Park for the cover story of Harper’s Bazaar Vietnam’s November 2017 issue. Then in 2022, Luxembourg artist Jeff Dieschburg won a cash prize of 1,500 euros (S$2,200) in a local competition for his painting — which bore a striking resemblance to Ms Zhang’s photograph . He also exhibited the painting at the Contemporary Art Biennale in Strassen, Luxembourg, where the work was listed for sale at 6,500 euros. Ms Zhang took Mr Dieschburg to a district court in Luxembourg for plagiarising her work, but the judges ruled in his favour in December 2022. The lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds that the model’s pose in Ms Zhang’s photo was “not unique” and did not fully meet the criteria of a copyrighted work of art. However, according to the Luxembourg daily newspaper Tageblatt, Ms Zhang’s appeal against this ruling was successful in a ruling handed down last Wednesday. The court ruled that Mr Dieschburg had used Ms Zhang’s photograph as a template for his work, titled “Turandot”, without citing the source, and thus violated copyright laws. Tageblatt, published in German, one of Luxembourg's official languages, said that Mr Dieschburg is no longer allowed to publicly display the painting in question. If he does, he risks a fine of 1,000 euros per day up to a maximum of 100,000 euros. Ms Zhang, who was listed in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list in 2018 that recognised young people in various industries, took to social media last Friday to announce her successful appeal in the lawsuit against Mr Dieschburg. “The Luxembourg court has ruled that Jeff Dieschburg infringed upon my copyright when he used my work without consent,” she wrote. “Using a different medium was irrelevant. My work being 'available online' was irrelevant. Consent was necessary.” Ms Zhang also wrote of the difficulties she faced throughout the legal battle, including how she had lost out on work due to how the situation “ate away at me”. She added that her home address had been doxxed, and attached screenshots of several hateful messages she received online — one of which told her to “stop being a little chicken”. “For two years I’ve been harassed for fighting this because of my gender, my race, my being a photographer,” Ms Zhang wrote. “So this is for the young me who couldn’t fight for herself, (and) for everyone else who's felt the same, that they couldn't challenge what seemed terrifying, powerful, and unjust.” In her posts, Ms Zhang made a point of thanking Luxembourg and its judicial system for “upholding copyright protection for an individual” in a time where the rise of artificial intelligence has caused much debate over artists’ rights. “I hope that more of the world will look towards Luxembourg and remember that copyright is what allows individual(s) like myself to work as an artist,” she wrote. “Because without knowing that I can own what I create and make a living off it — I could never have chosen this path for my life.” TODAY has reached out to Ms Zhang for further comment.

    "article_content": "News SINGAPORE — The display of glitz, glamour and grandiosity of the Met Gala last Monday (May 5) has inadvertently ruffled the feathers of a community of netizens online over the past week. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — The display of glitz, glamour and grandiosity of the Met Gala last Monday (May 6) has inadvertently ruffled the feathers of a community of netizens online over the past week. Graced by A-list celebrities, the Met Gala is widely regarded as the world’s most prestigious fashion event. But this year’s red carpet sparked heavy discourse on social media for different reasons. In the midst of the ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza strip, social media users are asking, how could a whole host of influential people turn a blind eye to its atrocities by partaking in such an extravaganza? Social media users pointed out that some of these celebrities had never publicly addressed the continuing war in Gaza, the northern part of which is currently experiencing a “full-blown famine”, according to the head of the United Nations World Food Programme Cindy McCain. Now, a new online movement has surfaced targeting celebrities who are seen as being insensitive or even supportive of the atrocities being committed in the Palestinian city. It is being dubbed “Blockout 2024”. TODAY looks at what the movement hopes to achieve and whether or not it would have a tangible impact on the ongoing crisis. Blockout 2024 is an online movement where social media users actively boycott famous celebrities and influencers by “blocking” their accounts on various platforms like Instagram, TikTok and X. Their objective is to reduce the earnings these celebrities make through advertisements on social media. By doing so, they believe celebrities would be pressured to use their influence to try to stop the violence in Gaza. In a video posted by the TikTok account “blockout2024” last Thursday, the user explained the rationale behind the movement. “When you have millions of followers that look at your content every single day, you have an opportunity to make very important change in our world. “And to actively not do that… and selfishly promote your own products is kind of shallow.” In a separate video posted on the same day, the user added: “We have full control over the incomes of news outlets, celebrities and artists. They make money off our hate, they make money off our praise. They do not make money when we block them and forget their names.” The user has since posted several “blocks of the day” videos with the names of celebrities he feels should be blocked. At the time of publication, the account has around 176,600 followers on TikTok and over 4 million views on its most popular video. The popularity of the “blockout” was fuelled by angry reactions to a video posted by TikTok influencer Haley Kalil, who posted a video on the platform lip-syncing the words “let them eat cake” outside the Met Gala. Those words are often attributed to Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France during the French Revolution. They refer to leaders far removed from people's everyday struggles such that they would suggest that people eat cake when they do not even have bread. Users have also drawn parallels with the movie The Hunger Games, where a group of lavishly rich elites in the capital live in stark contrast to people in other districts who live in poverty. According to Ms Chloe Lim, an account director at integrated creative agency DSTNCT, the Met Gala was “especially triggering” to some people because the event’s “sheer visual spectacle” contrasted with images from news reports the day before on Israel’s attack on Rafah, a city in the south of Gaza. “Due to social media, two global events which are seemingly completely unrelated now can be literally visually right on top of each other on our feeds,” Ms Lim said. “Humans are visual creatures and the contrast is undeniable. It takes logic and rational thinking to “give benefit of the doubt” and disconnect the Met organisers and celebrities involved. But this ignores that emotional side of us as humans.” Last Saturday, US-based media outlet National Public Radio (NPR) reported that Taylor Swift had lost around 300,000 followers on TikTok and 50,000 followers on Instagram over the past week. Singers Selena Gomez and Billie Eilish had also reportedly lost around 1 million and 1.1 million followers on Instagram respectively, according to Turkish public broadcaster TRT World. These blockings can certainly impact engagement and reach for those blocked and in turn impact ad revenue, according to Ms Charu Srivastava, the co-founder and chief strategy officer of strategic communications consultancy TriOn & Co. “It also extends to boycotting their work beyond social media — for example, movies, music or appearances, which in turn also affects their earnings,” she said, adding that the impact extends to the brands associated with the blocked celebrities and influencers as well. Indeed, there were previously calls to boycott fashion brand Zara back in December 2023 after it launched an ad campaign featuring statues wrapped in white , with many saying its images resembled photos of corpses in white shrouds in Gaza. Media intelligence firm CARMA said that the percentage of consumers who had negative sentiments towards Zara rose from 13.6 to 76.4 per cent following the incident. In terms of social media movements resulting in actual societal change, Ms Srivastava pointed to others which have sparked larger conversations and a “tangible impact” like the #MeToo movement. #MeToo was a social movement and awareness campaign against sexual abuse or harassment and rape culture, in which people talk publicly their experiences. The movement spread across the globe and led to several sexual abusers being charged and sentenced. There exists a sentiment, however, that the current blockout trend may be a form of “performative activism” — a type of activism that is done to increase one's social capital rather than because of one's devotion to a cause. Ms Lim of DSTNCT said the blockout may also draw comparisons to the Black Lives Matter movement where activists had called out “hypocrites” who posted plain black squares to stand in solidarity of the movement, but had done little in action to “really support black lives”. On what actual impact the blockout would have on the war in Gaza, one expert told US media outlet NPR that advocates of the movement hope it would force governments to do something to end the violence. \"But as rational as that logic may seem, I don't think there are very many examples where this has actually worked,” said assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan Marcus Collins. However, he added, the movement does provide social media users with “some sense of agency”. “(It gives them) a sense that 'I've done something to influence other people to do something that perhaps might make a difference'. Because in the minds of those folks, it's better than doing nothing.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — There is an abundance of academic studies that link excessive smartphone usage with health and psychological problems. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — There is an abundance of academic studies that link excessive smartphone usage with health and psychological problems. One 2023 study by University of Queensland researchers that I saw online found that more frequent smartphone use resulted in more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and poor sleeping quality, though I reckon one doesn't have to look very far to see examples of this among friends and acquaintances. I’m not sure if the average of four hours a day I spend on my phone counts as excessive or problematic — the daily average for Singaporeans clocks in at 4.51 hours daily — but the prospect of potentially improving my mental well-being through less phone-time sounds appealing to me. I’ve always romanticised the idea of living in a bygone, less tech-reliant era, where we don’t rush to our devices whenever a notification beckons. So, when the idea of a “digital detox” was first floated by my colleagues, naturally, I put my name in the hat. Last week, my colleague wrote an article detailing his unsuccessful attempt at “dopamine fasting” , though he somehow ended up spending even more time on his phone and on social media, when the goal was the exact opposite. I decided I wasn’t going to fall into the same traps he did. The rules I set myself were simple: For a week, I would go completely cold turkey on all forms of social media and leave my phone untouched as much as possible. My iPhone 14 would be used the same way I would use an old-school Nokia — text and call only. Smartphone? No, just phone. Well, why not? Last week, an expert who spoke to my colleague suggested against going cold turkey, recommending instead that having a schedule would be more useful to wean oneself from digital devices. I didn't want to doom my mission before it started, so I sought another expert for more answers. Mr Ganesh, who goes by one name and is a senior counsellor at Viriya Community Services who has a specialist interest in addictions, told me that going cold turkey may prompt an immediate change in removing one's addictive behaviours. However, the efficacy of the cold turkey as an intervention method largely depends on an individual's circumstances. \"Severe substance abuse, for example, may likely result in significant disruption to overall functioning. Hence, it may be more detrimental in the short-term to introduce a sudden stop without professional assessment,\" he added. The ability to sustain the cold turkey treatment and manage its resulting withdrawals is another big obstacle. Indeed, friends of mine who have successfully quit smoking have told me that while going cold turkey was the most effective tactic for breaking the habit, they experienced rather \"painful\" periods of nicotine withdrawal. To combat this, Mr Ganesh pointed to research showing that the presence of \"positive social support\" helps with addiction recovery and reducing the risk of relapse. So, to improve my chances of making it out of my digital detox successfully, I garnered the endorsement of some friends and family for my cold turkey plan and embarked on my mission. Did going cold turkey on social media and superfluous phone use make me happier and more productive? Well, sort of. On the first night of the experiment, I decided I would take a stroll down to my neighbourhood coffee shop, phone-less, to order a bowl of bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) for dinner. I was excited to finally be \"untethered\", and somewhat nostalgic of the times I used to attend primary school as a kid, unencumbered by the burden of the world in my palms. That excitement merely lasted the duration it took me to walk from my door to the lift. I had never been so afraid of the elevator breaking down, or perhaps a family emergency occurring the minute I decided to partake in this silly experiment, where I would be completely unreachable. Thankfully, nothing of that sort happened. Then, as I sat in a corner of the busy eatery waiting for my order, I grew increasingly uneasy — fiddling my thumbs and scanning my surroundings like a restless child. A tangible itch started to surface between my temples that I tried hard not to scratch. I studied every item on the large menu hung above the counter. Then I emptied the contents of my wallet and read the front and back of every card I owned. Then I counted the strands of hair I had above my knees. More than my stomach, my mind was starving to occupy itself with something. No doubt, I knew that if I had my phone with me, I wouldn't pay the slightest attention to my surroundings until my buzzer for my food rang. I would continue to feel instances of this discomfort over the course of the week. However, overall, I found that my self-imposed phone restrictions were a net positive. On days that I didn’t have work, the inability to scroll mindlessly on online forum Reddit or watch YouTube videos meant that I often found myself standing in the middle of my room wondering what to do with my sorry self. Forced to find a way to kill time, I was suddenly able do the things I always said I didn’t have time to do. I managed to read several books that were gathering dust on the shelf, complete some unnecessarily complex jigsaw puzzles I found lying around, and reorganise my mess of a room more times than I can count. When I did reach for my phone, it was a purpose-driven task to text or call the person I intended to, without inadvertently finding myself in the midst of my 50th YouTube Short an hour later, wondering how I got there. This sense of accomplishment for being “productive” outside of work brought me a wave of happiness each time. However, it also meant that there were no quick fixes for the moments in which I had to deal with difficult emotions. These were the toughest parts of my week-long experiment. When I got stressed or annoyed, all I wanted was for a stand-up comedian to make me laugh, a conspiracy theory to make my mind wander, or a cheesy rom-com compilation to make me tear. Essentially, I was looking to replace whatever negativity was within me with a quick dose of another, more pleasant emotion. I wouldn’t consider the experience of having to sit there with my thoughts pleasant in the slightest. Instead of distracting myself with the phone, I now had to confront my feelings head-on and acknowledge that they are there. Doing that and opening up to people I am close to is a much healthier approach than suppressing my feelings, I reckon. Indeed, clinical psychologist Maximillian Chen of Annabelle Psychology told me that using social media to distract from unpleasant emotions only brings about short-term relief. It leaves the root causes of unpleasant emotions unresolved and can potentially lead to poorer mental health in the long run. Having open conversations with people you trust can help you better organise your thoughts and may bring about a more lasting resolution to the unpleasant emotions, he said. I'm glad that was the option I chose. What I did not expect from this experiment was how my daily dependence on my phone for all other practical purposes, beyond just browsing on YouTube or social media, added to my frustrations. My efforts to leave my phone untouched as much as possible felt increasingly futile over the course of the week as well. When I was unable to connect my laptop to Wi-Fi networks outside, I required my phone to provide a hot spot to do work. When a family member suddenly complained of intense abdominal pains, I jumped to Google to find out what the problem might be. Forgetting to take along cash, I needed my Wallet application to pay for public transport. When I had to drive a relative to the hospital urgently, I used Google Maps to guide me there. At every instance where I reluctantly turned to my smartphone for help, I felt as though I had let myself down. Am I a slave to Big Tech after all? Am I not committed enough to this “digital detox”? I spent a good portion of the week chiding myself for these supposed failures, but upon some reflection, I realised I shouldn’t have. I wasn’t upset at having to use technology per se. I was annoyed at breaking my own rules. In most of these instances, having technology at my fingertips was beneficial to me in helping me navigate life’s unexpected problems and inconveniences. The problem was the cold turkey. Mr Chen of Annabelle Psychology had called it: While going cold turkey on my smartphone usage reduced its harms, it also reduced its benefits. I could use physical Ez-Link cards, have some cash with me and carry road maps around, but does that make me cultured or just stubborn against change? To completely remove oneself from using smartphones is, in my view, pointless given the society in which we live. Modern life in Singapore very much favours the digitally connected native (especially when restaurants stubbornly insist the only way to order food is by scanning a darned QR code). On the other hand, equally counterproductive is allowing the addictive nature of social media to sweep you into the deep ocean of doom scrolling just so you won’t have to confront the hard things in life. Perhaps there is another way. Another colleague of mine also tried her own digital detox — with rules that are a lot more reasonable than mine. I can’t help but think a more balanced approach like hers would be more effective and less frustrating. So watch this space next week for her account of how that went. In a book I read about digital minimalism by Cal Newport earlier on, he explained that the purpose of undergoing a digital detox such as this is to escape a state where “passive interactions with your screens is passive leisure”. My brief but semi-successful abstinence from social media did open up new pockets of time that weren’t previously there to do things I previously wouldn’t have done. I should give myself a pat on the back for that. Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Barely five months after he was born with cerebral palsy in 1964, Mr Alan Pek was placed in the care of a foster family because his biological parents had decided that they did not want to raise him. Mr Alan Pek (right) and his youngest daughter Pek Ling Fei at their home on June 13, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. This Father's Day, TODAY speaks to two fathers on how parenthood has changed their outlook on life. One father with cerebral palsy raises two daughters — one with special needs — and another has a toddler who changed how he runs his business to put his child and his employees' families first. We find out what motivates them to be better dads every day. SINGAPORE — Barely five months after he was born with cerebral palsy in 1964, Mr Alan Pek was placed in the care of a foster family because his biological parents had decided that they did not want to raise him. His condition meant that he took much longer to walk and speak than his peers. He had to be piggybacked to school until he was in kindergarten. He underwent session after session of speech therapy as a child. You could say that it was a life destined to be difficult. Yet, fast forward nearly six decades and Mr Pek, 60, was speaking to TODAY articulately, animatedly, unabashedly — now an assistant vice-president of a major international bank, a graduate of a university in the United Kingdom and a proud father of two. “The only thing I give up on is ‘giving up’ itself,” he said with his trademark grin in his cosy four-room flat in Jurong West. Mr Pek’s smile was at all times wide and infectious. Then, when he spoke about his children, he beamed. His older daughter is 22 years old and a final-year student at the Laselle College of the Arts. His younger daughter, 18-year-old Pek Ling Fei, studies at the Lee Kong Chian Gardens School at Movement of the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds), and is neurodivergent . Early in her life, Miss Pek Ling Fei was diagnosed with an intellectual disability known as global developmental delay. Due to her condition, she has a limited vocabulary and often feels overstimulated in crowded places with loud noises, at times triggering meltdowns where she cries uncontrollably in public. She also tends to get anxious in the presence of strangers, but she was comfortable being herself in the presence of her dad’s guests on this day. As the interview was done at the coffee table and Mr Pek was talking about the many obstacles he has had to face growing up with cerebral palsy, his younger girl broke into dance a stone’s throw away in the living room. He turned his gaze towards her and gushed with pride: “She’s incredible.” In all his years of being a father, with all its highs and lows, Mr Pek said that he has learnt to “embrace every moment, and (do so) with unconditional empathy”. Mr Pek is a man not short of confidence in his own abilities in work and in life. From the variety of experiences that he shared with TODAY over two hours, it was clear that he does not view his cerebral palsy as a debilitating ailment. He asked this reporter what “PWD” stands for, an acronym commonly used for persons with disabilities. When told the answer, he countered: “No. The ‘D’ stands for dedication, determination.” When he sat for his Primary School Leaving Examination decades ago, he had been given an extra 30 minutes to finish his papers. He left the examination hall earlier than his peers and still aced the exam. When he was not allowed to convert his overseas driving licence to one valid for use in Singapore, he dutifully took all his theory tests again and surprised his driving instructors with his abilities on the road. He also encountered a fair share of scepticism from peers when he was hired by Deutsche Bank 27 years ago. He is now a senior member and an integral part of the bank’s global infrastructure team, where over the years, he has had to coordinate projects around the clock. With a neurodivergent daughter and years of experiencing discrimination for his condition, Mr Pek has done his bit to try to make Singapore society more inclusive, starting at his own firm: He is one of the founding “fathers” of dbEnable, a voluntary group aimed at advocating for the employability of people who are differently abled. The programme includes a work placement offering 10-week internships to neurodivergent students from Singapore’s universities, some of whom secure employment with the bank upon graduation. “Having experienced a lack of support upon joining the bank in 1997, I wanted to create an environment where interns felt welcomed and had someone to turn to.” As a “differently abled person”, he had always felt the need to work twice as hard to prove that he was just as capable as anyone else. And when it comes to parenting, Mr Pek brings that same level of energy and zeal. His wife Sue Wong, 51, an auditor, said: “He’s always very positive… he brings light to our family and he is a very important pillar of our family. “Being parents in Singapore is very stressful, but with what Alan experienced over the course of his life, he shows us that we can do it.” At Minds, the teachers of Mr Pek's younger girl train and nurture her independent living skills, and expose her to various activities that involve music, art and sports, in addition to traditional academics, he said. Still, he believes that parents play the most crucial role in a child’s development. “Children need their fathers more than their fathers realise… I made myself a promise. If one day I become a father, I will not become like my own father.” Although Mr Pek’s foster family provided him with “unwavering love and support”, his biological father had been absent in his adolescence, meeting him only during the annual Chinese New Year festivities later in his life. As Mr Pek prepares to celebrate his 22nd Father’s Day this Sunday (June 16), he told me that he had always wanted to do for his children what his own father did not do for him. Whether it be parent-teacher meetings, award ceremonies or overseas holidays, Mr Pek would not let his responsibilities at work and volunteer organisations stop him from being present at all of his daughters’ important milestones. When asked what his fondest memories are of his daughters, he said without missing a beat: “Every moment is precious.” He added: “My elder girl has grown into a fine young lady, with kindness and righteousness. We are also very open and can discuss anything under the sun. “As for Ling Fei, every accomplishment — from basic tasks like sleeping and dressing independently to moments of joy such as dancing and playing the electric organ — fills me with immense pride. \"Her laughter and comforting hugs are so precious.” Was he ever concerned that his cerebral palsy would be a hindrance to his parenting? “I always believed I could do it. But thinking that you ‘can’ is not enough, you must be willing to do it and put in the effort.” As soon as he said this, like a moth to a flame, his younger daughter hopped over to her father and gently leaned against him, initiating a warm embrace. He appeared surprised by this, but he returned the gesture swiftly. “Love you, love you, love you,” he said to her.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — It was during her 19th consecutive day of work as a junior doctor at a public hospital three years ago that Dr Faith Choo, physically and mentally drained, first considered breaking her medical service bond. A junior doctor who broke her bond with MOH Holdings. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — It was during her 19th consecutive day of work as a junior doctor at a public hospital three years ago that Dr Faith Choo, physically and mentally drained, first considered breaking her medical service bond. She still had a long way to go until the end of the bond she had signed with MOH Holdings (MOHH), the holding company for Singapore's public healthcare institutions. The agreement requires her to work in the public healthcare sector for five years upon graduation. This does not include a year of internship, or housemanship, which commences right after graduation. To break the bond, she would have to repay around S$100,000 for each year of service she did not fulfil. However, barely a year in, the then 24-year-old was already mulling if it would be worth forking out that hefty sum if it meant freedom from constant scrutiny at work while being perennially sleep-deprived and physically unwell. Dr Choo, now 27, said: “It got me wondering whether it was worth it in the long run, sacrificing so much of my health and my youth. Because if you do it for five, six years, you don't know — maybe you're shortening your lifespan by a couple of years.” She broke her bond in 2022 and now works as a locum doctor in the private sector, covering the duties of regular doctors who are on leave or unable to work. Dr Choo's experience was far from unique. The high rate of burnout among junior doctors led the Government to set up the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors in December 2021, to look into the issue and recommend ways to promote the well-being of junior doctors in the public healthcare system. Last month, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in response to a parliamentary question that this committee, which comprises both senior and junior doctors, had finalised its recommendations. These include “setting clearer work hour guidelines for junior doctors, enhancing career guidance, and promoting a safe and supportive environment for junior doctors”, the ministry said, without giving specifics. TODAY has reached out to MOH for further details, but have yet to receive a response at time of publication. Even with the committee working on this, doctors have in recent months turned to online forum Reddit to vent about their long working hours. One Reddit user, who identified as a Singapore doctor, specifically bemoaned the traditional “call system” at public hospitals. While on call, a doctor may work up to 30 hours straight — a full day of work followed by the night shift, and up until the following afternoon. Commenting on this, Dr Choo said that this call system has repercussions for patients as well. “I realised it's quite dangerous for patient safety, because (the sleep deprivation) really reduces the quality of care that I could provide to them.” Dr Koh Poh Koon, formerly Senior Minister of State for Health, said in 2022 that although Singapore Medical Council's guidelines state that junior doctors may work up to 80 hours a week, surveys showed that 20 per cent of them exceeded this. TODAY spoke to seven junior doctors in Singapore, most of whom did not provide their real names for fear that speaking out would affect their careers. Although work hours and workloads differed based on where they are posted, all said that they were burnt out and many are considering leaving the public sector. In March 2023, MOH said that the attrition rate of all doctors in the public healthcare sector had “remained stable in the last three years”, ranging from 3 to 5 per cent, but did not specify the rate for junior doctors. Data on the proportion or number of junior doctors who break their bonds are not publicly available either. However, those who spoke to TODAY said they believe that more junior doctors are planning to do so. The feeling of being overworked lies at the heart of their complaints. What makes the lifestyle harder to bear are the comparatively “better” lives that doctors in the private sector appear to have. Bryan, a medical officer in his late 20s working at a public hospital, said that it is “tempting” to break his bond early and work in a private clinic, in spite of the large amount of liquidated damages he would have to pay MOHH. He earns a monthly salary of around S$5,000, not including the allowance he receives for working weekend rounds. In contrast, a locum earns an average of S$10,000 a month. One 27-year-old interviewee, who took a loan to break her MOHH bond and then work as a locum in the private sector this year, said that she now earns S$14,000 to S$18,000 a month by taking on more locum gigs. This is up from the S$5,000 a month that she earned in the public sector. Bryan said: “You’re not getting paid as much compared to working as a locum in the private sector. Their hours are way better, they get more flexibility, and they get to pursue things outside of medicine, too.\" And those who choose to break their bonds may not even have to fork out the penalty themselves. Bryan said that private clinics have approached several of his peers to offer them jobs as locum doctors, effective immediately, and even offered to pay off their bonds for them. Several other doctors said that this form of headhunting is a common practice in the medical industry. TODAY reached out to several private healthcare companies but all declined to comment. The attraction is not just about the money. For many, the pull of the private sector is the level of autonomy and control that they would have over their lives. Tom, a former medical officer in his early 30s who broke his bond in 2021 and now works in the private sector, said: “If I earn more money, it's because I choose to work more hours. If I have more patients that follow me and consult with me, it’s because I deliver good service. “So now, I wield the power to make a difference that actually matters.” In response to TODAY's queries, Member of Parliament (MP) Yip Hon Weng, who is part of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, acknowledged that the public sector, while essential, is often unable to match the remuneration offered by the private sector. \"Moreover, junior doctors often feel like 'cogs in a machine', with their personal strengths and interests overlooked,\" Mr Yip said. Another gripe that junior doctors have is with the residency system. To become a specialist in Singapore, a medical officer must be selected for a residency programme, such as for anaesthesiology, neurosurgery and ophthalmology, which can take three to six years to complete. However, applications for these residency programmes open only once a year and can be incredibly competitive. Certain specialisations have much higher demand than there are slots available. This means many applicants inevitably miss out on their preferred programme and have to try again the following year. Interviewees said that some junior doctors, after failing in their initial applications, decide not to try again and cut their losses by breaking their bonds. This is because their career “runway” as a fully fledged specialist becomes shorter, and they would have to rethink plans for their own personal lives. Tom, who now works in aesthetic medicine, said this is one example of how junior doctors end up feeling disillusioned. “A lot of us have different passions, different callings and different abilities,” Tom added. “But instead of being developed and nurtured for our strengths, we’re being fit into a mould — we’re told we have to fill this need and that need, and therefore whatever else you can do does not matter. “It’s like we’re a faceless bunch of manpower.” Anna, a 29-year-old medical officer working in a public hospital, said that she appreciates the initiatives that have been introduced over the years to better care for junior doctors. One is the allowance given to doctors who work weekends , which came into place in February 2023. At some hospitals, there is also strict end-shift timings for staff members and a night-float system to replace the traditional call system. In a night-float system, a dedicated team of doctors take over the care of patients for consecutive nights in a week, and a different team of doctors resume care of patients the following day. This usually entails an overnight shift of 12 to 15 hours. It eliminates the need for prolonged working hours and allows junior doctors more rest. The National University Health System (NUHS), one of three healthcare clusters in Singapore, said that it has put in place the night-float system in some departments in the National University Hospital since 2007 and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital since 2015. \"To manage the manpower required to support this system, the night float is hybridised with doctors who also perform traditional night calls in a 24-hour shift until 8am the following day,\" NUHS said. However, interviewees noted that the system has not been set up at all public hospitals, and junior doctors are not in control over which healthcare institution they are posted to work. And even with these initiatives in place, Anna said that “it doesn’t mean it’s great or ideal now”. Others pointed out smaller initiatives that have been introduced to help them, such as the offering of occasional snack packs and online seminars on how to manage stress, but they said that these are far from adequate and do not tackle the problem of overwork. Since 2017, Singapore's public healthcare system has been organised into three integrated clusters. They are the National Healthcare Group (NHG), SingHealth, and the National University Health System (NUHS). TODAY reached out to all three to understand the measures and initiatives they have taken to ensure junior doctors' well-being and address their concerns. 1. National University Health System (NUHS) With the night float system, a dedicated team of doctors take over the care of patients for consecutive nights in a week, and a different team of doctors resume care of patients the following day. Besides this, NUHS said that the cluster has also introduced parallel career tracks such as the Hospital Clinician scheme for non-specialist doctors who anchor inpatient care services in a role complementary to specialists. Additionally, NUHS has rolled out the following measures: 2. SingHealth Professor Terrance Chua, who is the group chairman (medical board) for SingHealth, said that strong support for healthcare professionals, including junior doctors, is fundamental in enabling them to provide the best care they can to patients. To help do this, SingHealth said that it has put in place the following: 3. National Healthcare Group (NHG) Associate Professor Faith Chia, who is the designated institutional official for NHG Residency, said that the cluster recognises that the well-being of doctors directly affects patient safety and care quality. NHG said that it has introduced initiatives such as: Assoc Prof Chia added that NHG would also be launching a new career guidance counselling portal and mentor-matching system in the coming academic year. Mr Yip, who is the MP for Yio Chu Kang, said that while MOH has made some adjustments to improve the situation, \"there is more to be done\". \"Medicine is more than a job; it is a calling that requires dedication and sacrifice ,\" he added. \"The public sector must strive to provide a supportive environment that recognises and rewards these sacrifices while ensuring the sustainability of our healthcare system.\" To that end, Mr Yip offered several suggestions of his own, including: To prevent an exodus to the private sector, Mr Yip said that MOH could consider extending the period of a doctor's conditional registration and re-evaluate the need for certain specialties. Mr Louis Ng, MP for Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency who had asked MOH for an update on the review of junior doctors' welfare in a parliamentary question, told TODAY that there may be a huge impact on the healthcare system if the issues that junior doctors face are not resolved soon. “I think it's a vicious circle. As more (doctors) leave, the remaining ones have to work more. When the remaining ones work more, the attrition goes up — and we have seen that first hand during Covid-19 with the nurses . “I think it's a sad problem that we have such young doctors who are burning out so fast.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — When I signed up to attend a 12-hour mental health \"first aid\" course, I was hoping to learn more of how to offer appropriate words of comfort or advice to people who need a listening ear. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — When I signed up to attend a 12-hour mental health \"first aid\" course, I was hoping to learn more of how to offer appropriate words of comfort or advice to people who need a listening ear . However, I soon realised that being a good listener to someone who is mentally distressed or emotionally unstable is not enough. It is like having just a roll of adhesive tape in a first-aid kit. You would need the antiseptic wipes, burn cream, bandages and gauze pads, too. And more importantly, for the uninitiated, you’d need an instruction manual. Make no mistake: Taking the course does not teach one the skills to be a therapist, or to clinically diagnose anyone. Its purpose is to train someone to look out for signs of a mental health problem and provide effective support in that moment. To give a perspective on this, Dr Praveen Nair, a senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, said that these skills can take professional clinicians “years to master”. That was why I fumbled, floundered and tripped on my words when I was first instructed to provide mental health first aid to a coworker in a role play. I wondered what my resounding failure would have meant if it were a real-life situation. Much like physical emergencies, mental health emergencies come in various forms and complexities, and an effective first aider needs to know how to identify the problem. That is what the mental health first aid course by Intellect, an integrated mental healthcare firm, purports to help you do. The company classified mental health first aid as the initial help offered to a person who is: The first aid is given until appropriate professional help is received, or until the crisis is resolved. The course provided by Intellect first comprises six hours of e-modules, which cover: Once I had completed the e-modules, I went through another six hours of live training in-person, where I sat in a cosy room along with a diverse group of about 20 other people who felt strongly about mental health advocacy in society. Together with a trained facilitator, we role-played different situations where mental health first aid was required, in order to practise what we had learned. We also went through many rounds of personal sharing to discuss our own experiences and the range of complex situations we might face. I was not expecting to turn into an expert overnight, but I managed to glean some basics on what it takes to be more understanding of people who need care for their mental health . 1. Mental health can get better or worsen on a continuum People often associate mental health directly with mental illness, which can be problematic. One’s mental health is a continuum (or a scale) ranging from good mental health on one end, to having mental illness on the other. What is important to remember is that one's health can slide up and down this scale at different points in time and in life. A particularly stressful few weeks may affect your mental health negatively to a point where your quality of life takes a hit. However, it may not be severe enough to warrant a diagnosis or medical intervention. Similarly, if someone is diagnosed with a mental illness, this means that it affects a person's thinking, emotional state and behaviour, and disrupts the person's ability to work or carry out other daily activities. However, it does not mean that they cannot get better over time. 2. Asking someone about their suicidal thoughts does not encourage them to act on them Just the thought of confronting someone about their plans to take their own life feels incredibly taboo and uncomfortable. However, it might be necessary if you spot the following signs, which are not exhaustive but are the more common ones: It is important to ask a person directly about suicidal thoughts and not avoid using the word \"suicide\". Contrary to making them feel worse, the person may feel relief from talking about their suicidal thoughts with someone who cares. People experiencing thoughts of suicide are often driven by a need to escape overwhelming despair, I’ve learnt, and may not be able to imagine any other way to resolve those feelings. Simply being present is good because your presence acts as a safety net. People are more likely to act on thoughts of suicide when they are alone. 3. If someone is having a panic attack, breathing into a paper bag is not the answer This approach, or even saying \"take some deep breaths\" may work in the moment in some cases to get someone to first try and calm down, but the advice cannot be callously dispensed as if you are mindlessly telling the person to just go and wash their face and leave them at that. There has to be some follow-up action. It also points to a larger lesson: There is no one-size-fits-all approach to supporting and treating people with mental health problems. People need a mix of support and treatments that fit their individual preferences and needs. In the event of people having a panic attack, rather than making assumptions or judgements about what they need, here is what we can do: 4. Strong reactions to self-harm can be counterproductive If a person is cutting himself or herself to cope with emotional distress, you should avoid expressing a strong negative reaction to the self-injury. Although it is natural to feel upset, helpless and even angry upon finding out that someone is inflicting self-harm, try to remain calm and avoid expressions of shock or anger. Tell the person that you are concerned about him or her and ask whether you can do anything to reduce the distress. Ask if medical attention is needed. 5. As a first-aider, you are serving as the gateway to getting mentally distressed persons to seek professional help Despite how much knowledge you may think you have about mental illnesses, or how confident you are in spotting its corresponding signs, we are not the saviour of the world, but mere middlemen. Furthermore, it is important to remember that people may be reluctant to talk about any mental health problems for various reasons. When approaching a co-worker who you believe may be depressed, let him know that you are available to talk when he is ready; do not put pressure on him to talk right away. It can be helpful to let the person choose the moment to open up — and who to open up to as well. If the person is reluctant, you could explain to him that mental health problems can make it difficult to manage work, relationships and day-to-day tasks, and getting help for those problems can make it easier to cope. You may also provide information for the person to take away and read later, and reconnect with him at a later time to see if he is more willing to talk. Dr Oliver Suendermann, a clinical psychologist and vice-president (clinical) of Intellect, said that since the firm launched its mental health first aid course in September last year, around 600 people had completed the course. The cost of its 12-hour programme and an individual certification is S$337.50 a person after tax. A brief search online showed that other organisations here provided similar mental health or psychosocial first aid courses at various rates from at least S$100. I reached out to more experts to ask if it will be helpful for people to take up such courses and the responses were mixed. Mr Haikal Jamil, a senior clinical psychologist and founder of ImPossible Psychological Services, said that such courses can make society more caring and inclusive by helping people to recognise that mental healthcare is common, and that people struggling with mental health conditions are not flawed. He referred to the most recent Singapore Mental Health Study, which found that 13.9 per cent of Singaporeans are likely to struggle with a mental health condition in their lifetime. “As the people around those struggling with their mental health are more likely to notice the signs before the struggling individual… having the knowledge of common mental health issues and how to approach them is a good start to increase the likelihood of early help-seeking,” Mr Haikal said. Dr Nair of Raven Counselling and Consultancy, on the other hand, noted that there is a lack of independent research that supports the purported beneficial effects of mental health first aid for participants. He believes that government policies — such as having insurance plans that cover various forms of mental illness — play a much larger role than individual private courses in making society more caring and inclusive for people with mental illnesses. Furthermore, it is difficult to divorce the prevalence of mental illness to the structure of society, Dr Nair added. For instance, multiple studies have proven a cyclical link between financial worries and mental health problems , so policies that aid with the rising cost of living can help improve a population's overall well-being. Another point he made was that participants who tend to benefit the most from such courses are those who have certain “necessary prerequisites”, such as emotional intelligence and interest in mental health matters. In spite of this, I felt as though the various lessons I had learned had made my time and effort worth my while. Though I cannot claim to be an expert in any mental health condition at all, I am more confident of my role as a discerning and empathetic “middleman” — more cognisant of my peers’ emotions and behaviours, and knowing how to direct them to get help should things get messy.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Growing up obsessed with pop culture, I was certain that my goal in life was to become a radio deejay. I was passionate about the music scene and was the programme director of my polytechnic’s very own radio station. Growing up obsessed with pop culture, I was certain that my goal in life was to become a radio deejay. I was passionate about the music scene and was the programme director of my polytechnic’s very own radio station. Convinced that this was my road to success, I sought to turn my passion and craft into a professional career in media and entertainment. So, as a 17-year-old, I embarked on my diploma in mass communications at Ngee Ann Polytechnic with a clear vision of what I wanted to do in the future. But as they say, life is what happens to you while you’re making other plans. During my final year of my diploma studies, both my grandfathers had to go in and out of the hospital for various reasons. My maternal grandfather had Alzheimer’s disease, which eventually led to him struggling with severe dementia. He started losing his memory and his ability to independently carry out his daily activities, and my grandmother had to take up the role of being his primary caregiver. I remember offering to stay over to watch my grandfather overnight so that my grandmother could rest and take a break from her caregiving responsibilities. I spent the entire night watching him abruptly wake up from his sleep, watching him while his eyes stayed open, talking to the ceiling over and over again while trying to take off his mittens that we had to put on to protect himself from involuntarily scratching his fragile skin. This gave me my first glimpse of what it was like to be a caregiver and having to bear the physical, emotional and mental load of someone who could not do it for themselves any longer. But being only 19 and having zero medical knowledge at the time, all I knew was that my grandpa was slowly slipping away, and my time left with him was limited. Over the next few months, my grandfather’s condition deteriorated and he had to be admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). This was my first ever memory of being in a hospital setting. He was admitted to a geriatric ward but was only there for a short period of time before he passed on. I remember being the one to realise that he had stopped breathing, and alerted my family members who then informed the nurse in charge. I was impressed with how calm and collected the nurses were, and how they exercised compassion towards us and treated my grandfather with dignity in his final moments. Sadly, less than a year later, my paternal grandfather unexpectedly passed away as well. Their deaths struck me deeply, because they were the first closest relatives of mine that I had lost. I was experiencing and understanding grief for the first time in my life. It was also at this point in time that I was in the last few months of my diploma studies and had to start my university applications. Although I had really wanted to further my studies in communications, my grades were not adequate enough to enrol into the course that I had wanted. So, I stopped to rethink what I wanted my future to look like. My father suggested trying out nursing because I always had a soft spot for the elderly and loved taking care of people. I was unsure at first, and started to ask around to see what people thought of me joining the profession. Although many said that they couldn’t imagine me being anyone other than “Kim the DJ”, some said otherwise and easily pictured me becoming a nurse. I then learnt that growing up, the women who I looked up to as role models also happened to be nurses. My paternal grandmother worked as a senior assistant nurse. The captain of my Girls’ Brigade co-curricular activity in Presbyterian High School at the time is currently an advanced practice nurse. In that sense, I felt an affinity with the industry even though it was not something that I had considered before. Another big motivator was the fact that I wanted to study something that would give me more practical skills, after the helplessness I felt during my two grandfathers’ final months. I wanted to be able to take care of my parents and family in the future, and not feel as clueless as I previously did. So, I decided to enrol in nursing school at the National University of Singapore with no medical knowledge at all. The first few months were an uphill battle, and I remember constantly reflecting on whether I made the right choice. But thankfully, I managed to find my footing one step at a time, and fell in love with the exciting new journey I was on. Eventually, I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in nursing in 2020. But my final year was the hardest hurdle to cross, as the Covid-19 pandemic had thrown the world of healthcare into a tizzy. I was attached to TTSH as part of my final hospital attachment before I graduated. That was in April 2020, when the first circuit-breaker was implemented in Singapore. I admit I was very scared to leave the safety of my home to head to the hospital at a time when not much was known about the virus. It was a strange sensation to head to work when everyone was forced to stay home. But the work needed to be done and lives needed to be saved. A few months later, I officially started work as a staff nurse in TTSH. Due to the strict safe distancing measures back then, many of our orientation programmes were delayed, cancelled, or conducted online instead. This meant that we had to adapt and learn many things on-the-job. As much as I would’ve liked to say that I coped with the transition well, the truth is that I had never experienced this much stress and anxiety before. Nothing could have prepared me fully for how mentally, physically, and emotionally demanding nursing was. From having to increase my knowledge through learning about different diseases, care plans and medications, and keeping up with the ever-changing protocols; to becoming competent and efficient in my nursing care, I was forced to absorb everything and learn from my seniors as quickly as possible. Due to the heavy workload, I lost a lot of weight. This definitely made work even more draining: Imagine a 42kg 24-year-old trying to carry patients double or triple her size. Truth be told, there were more lows than highs in my first year of nursing. But the one thing that always rekindled my sense of purpose was reminding myself that although I wasn’t able to take care of my grandfathers anymore, I was entrusted with the duty of looking after someone else’s life at their most vulnerable state. Having that perspective really kept me grounded and motivated me to continue to be the best nurse I could be for my patients. Three fulfilling years later, I’m currently a senior staff nurse in an acute internal medicine unit at TTSH. I’m also currently a preceptor to students and new nurses who are at the start of their nursing journey. I do my best to support them just like how my seniors supported me at the beginning of my career. I frequently reflect on my journey and think about how differently I deal with similar situations now, thanks to the experience I’ve gained over the past few years. I know that three years ago, I would not have had the confidence I currently possess to handle demanding patients and their family members, while being efficient and effective in the coordination of my patients’ care. But it was thanks to hard work and the support of my seniors that showed me how it is done. With Nurses Day approaching on Aug 1, I’m also proud of how the role of nurses has evolved over the years, as well as the opportunities given to us to specialise in our areas of interest such as research, education, management, or clinicals. Nursing is hardly a stagnant role, and there are schemes to encourage innovation among us too. For example, TTSH’s Nursing Innovation Bunch has a S$1,000 funding scheme for new nurses to trial their innovative ideas in their first and second year of employment. I’m able to do less repetitive and strenuous tasks thanks to robotics and automation, which frees up my energy to focus on building trust and strong relationships with my patients and their families. This allows me to provide more holistic patient care and attend to their emotional needs, a vital aspect of a patient’s recovery journey that is often overlooked. I decided to write this article because my career in TTSH nursing has been nothing short of fulfilling and exciting, despite all the challenges that come along with it. Every shift is completely different, and you learn and experience something new every single day. It’s one of the professions that changes your life for the better while you do the same for others. Despite mostly being in clinical nursing, I’ve also embarked on many creative projects along the way in TTSH, tapping into my past as a mass communications student. From creating nursing content for our social media, to writing articles and hosting events, I’ve been given many opportunities to keep my creative side alive. My advice to anyone who might be at the crossroads of deciding what career path to head down would be to take a chance at something new. After all, my experience taught me that we don’t just have one passion in life to pursue. Work hard and learn as much as you can no matter which stage of life you’re in. You’ll pick up things that’ll help you wherever you’re going next, even though they may seem completely irrelevant at that point in time.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks For a long time, I never understood what it meant when others said life is short, and that I should therefore live it to its fullest. Mr Alvin Ong, photographed at Ngee Ann Polytechnic on July 6, 2023. He applied for Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Early Admissions Exercise for adult learners. For a long time, I never understood what it meant when others said life is short, and that I should therefore live it to its fullest. Life, to me at the time, was not about finding new adventures or stepping into the unknown. I didn’t believe in abandoning stable paths to seek out personal passions. There was always going to be time for me later on in life to chase my dreams. At 21, I “signed on” during National Service as a full-time communications systems officer in the Navy. This job came to me at a time of great uncertainty. My hawker parents had just lost their beloved stall after the building it was situated in got torn down, and I, being an only child, felt an overwhelming sense of duty to get my career straightened out to put their minds at ease. Although this was not a passion, my job offered a strong sense of camaraderie as well as a degree of stability that I appreciated at the time. Before the end of my five-year contract with the Navy, I had already settled on renewing and extending my stay. This changed, however, after the sudden passing of a dear friend. When I first heard that he had drowned in an unfortunate accident (that was not job-related), I was filled with complete disbelief, sadness, and then, regret about the life he never got to live. I had always thought he had the best potential to succeed in life among our group of friends, as he had a tenacious work ethic that I often tried to emulate. As I reminisced about the past six years we had spent together, going through thick and thin in the same company during National Service and as fellow full-time servicemen, I then started to wonder if he had other passions, hopes and dreams that he wanted to pursue. At 27, surely he had big, bold ambitions he wanted to achieve. Perhaps he had taken a pause on these goals, thinking he could wait another year before taking that first step. He would not have known what was to come — no one could have known. Those same thoughts stuck with me for the next couple of days, prompting me to take a hard look at the life I had lived up to that point and where I truly wanted to go next. It wasn’t that my job at the Navy lacked fulfilling experiences. Conversely, there were plenty of opportunities to travel across Southeast Asia as well as being able to meet lifelong friends on the job. But rather, it was the fact that I wanted to spread my wings and pursue a career that was closer to my heart, so that I can live without regrets of having not tried. It took me some time to decide that I needed to move on. But as they say, it’s always easier said than done, and I needed to take giant steps in order to switch careers. I panicked when I started to think about where I wanted to be in the next five to ten years of my career. I began to realise that I had reached a “saturation point” and felt that I needed to make some changes in my life to find fulfilment in the years to come. But what would bring me satisfaction? I thought back to what I had always wanted to do in my youth, but was never able to commit to my interests due to various reasons. I realised I always had an interest in electrical engineering, and remembered that this was something I had wanted to pursue back in my polytechnic days. But I thought that door was shut due to my poor academic results at the time. Even then, my appreciation for the industry never truly faded. I thought about how I enjoyed my role as a communications systems officer in the Navy, which allowed me to be surrounded by machines. While I could perform basic procedures like corrective maintenance when systems malfunctioned, I was curious about their inner workings. By coincidence, a few of my friends were also thinking about taking on “upskilling” courses during that time and were also seeking to switch their careers. So, I joined them as we mapped out a realistic roadmap. But throughout this process, the decision to switch careers continued to weigh heavily on me. My main doubts were about whether I could cope with going back to school again, as I still needed to attain the right qualifications for my desired job. I was 28 at the time — still relatively young but the last I stepped into a classroom was years ago. I was afraid that I lacked the youthful vigour needed to endure the trials and tribulations of the classroom. As I battled these doubts, I discovered Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s (NP) early admissions exercise for working adults, which opened the door for me to pursue a Diploma in Electrical Engineering with the polytechnic. With my parents’ blessings and NP’s support, I could pay my school fees in instalments, which lessened the financial burden. As there was a pandemic at the time, I began lessons in a virtual classroom in April 2020. My first semester was rocky, to say the least. Apart from the acute awareness of how I was many years older than my classmates, there was also trepidation from my lack of a strong foundation in calculus and physics, which, unfortunately, were needed for the bulk of my modules in the first semester. Online classes were also nothing short of challenging. Everything was so heavily reliant on the Internet and connectivity that I sometimes found myself feeling a sense of fatigue towards virtual calls. Having to navigate assignments and lectures in the confines of my room also felt stifling, much akin to what I felt during long deployments at sea. Even when in-person classes did resume, they were definitely awkward at the very beginning. It was clear to us that we did not really know one another, even though we had been on the same calls for an entire semester. Looking back, I’m glad to say that I pushed through. Soon enough, I found myself fully immersed in student life. I feel incredibly lucky to say that, despite my worries, no lecturer or peer made me feel any less just because I was older, so much so that the age difference felt almost non-existent at times. While I had zero expectations of finding any friends due to the age gap, this proved not to be the case when I eventually formed a solid group of friends through group projects and common interests, including manga, television shows, and more. Above all, studying what I loved and had a passion for made all the difference. I never thought that I could thrive in school, but here I was, genuinely finding joy in attending classes and taking a deep dive into the world of programming. It felt as though I was indulging in a hobby that ultimately opened a whole new world of opportunities to me. We are often primed to think that there are only a few designated pathways to pursuing a degree, and that if we are not on these pathways, our hopes are dashed. I have discovered that this is not the case. To anyone thinking of a mid-career switch to pursue your passion, there are options, including part-time diplomas, and support systems that make the journey far less daunting. The first step always starts with researching what is out there and seeing the possibilities that are available if you just take a leap of faith. Understanding the courses offered by NP and the resources provided to adult learners made a huge difference in my decision to return to school. This also requires the charting of realistic timelines and expectations for yourself. For instance, I started out thinking I could balance both work and studies by pursuing a part-time diploma, only to realise that I would not be able to cope with the rigour that both work and school demanded. I did not have to do this alone, of course, and had friends and family to talk to and offer advice. Consult those whom you trust, be it your parents or your friends, and get them to be your sounding board as you try to pinpoint your passions, what you want to do in life, and how you are going to get there. Lastly, remember to enjoy the process of returning back to school, especially if you are going back as a full-time student. There are extracurricular activities to help you immerse fully in the school environment, and making new friends will come naturally too. Going back to school as an adult is tough, but it doesn’t have to be tedious. Having graduated in May this year, I can look back at my past three years as an adult learner with great fondness. I am still on that road, and today I am preparing to pursue a degree in computer science at a university level, something that I didn’t think was possible. We only have one life and living it the best way possible, on our own terms, sometimes means having to leave behind what seems to be familiar and safe, and taking the road less travelled.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Design has always held a special place in my heart since I was young. Workplace experience designer based in DBS, Mr Marcus Liu Kang, 29, poses for a photo at the wellness space located in DBS Asia Central, on Aug 11, 2023. Design has always held a special place in my heart since I was young. From the satisfaction of neatly arranged text on a form, to the awe at beautifully crafted spaces, I have always been aware and appreciative of the profound influence of good design. At the same time, I was also piqued by how designs, even poorly conceived ones, lead people to change their behaviour. There’s the concept of desire paths — unsanctioned routes that are inadvertently created when people take repeated shortcuts, over a field for example, because the paved pathways fail to consider pedestrians’ needs. I was always noticing things such as insufficient signage and convoluted wayfinding in larger MRT stations that confuse commuters on which exit they should take, or how bus drivers always had to get out of their seats to deploy the ramp for passengers in wheelchairs. All of these small frustrations people face on a daily basis are linked to design. Growing up, I paid special attention to examples where more thought could have been given to user experience and make lives easier. So, it was only natural for me to pursue a degree in architecture at the National University of Singapore, graduating in 2020 with a Master's degree. Just as my predecessors ahead of me trod the well-beaten path of becoming an architect, I did so too, joining the industry shortly after my graduation. I thought I could carve out a career designing various beautiful and thoughtful spaces that people would admire and love. During my internships and early in my career as an architectural designer, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects from public housing competitions to good class bungalows, and in the commercial sector, from shophouses to hospitality resorts. But it was during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic that I experienced a profound shift in perspective towards work. Witnessing first-hand the impact and limitations of physical spaces — living rooms morphed into office spaces, while open offices became insufficient and underutilised in the era of Zoom calls and hybrid work — I began to doubt the lasting impact I could make as an architectural designer. For me, architecture is the application of design in a way that is well-positioned to impact people, being largely related to the spaces we work, play and sleep in on a daily basis. A well-designed space can impact much of our daily lives, from designing with thermal comfort and natural ventilation in mind to providing inhabitants with a sense of safety. But while being an architect was challenging and exciting, I wished I could go further with my work. What comes next after a space is built? A space is so much more than its initial design, yet the impact of designers often ceases upon the handover and completion of the project. During Covid-19, one of my projects at the time was to work on staff accommodation where we had to future-proof our design to comply with quarantine requirements, while still ensuring the efficient use of limited space. But that got me thinking further: What about the existing spaces we already have? Who then tackles these changing requirements as they arise? An empty school can double up as a testing centre, but it was designed firstly as an institution for learning. A hostel can likewise be repurposed for quarantine, but was designed for social interactions and communal living. While they serve their new, functional purpose, they were never intended to and are not ideal for what they were now meant to achieve. People’s needs change, and the intended user likewise changes, even if our buildings do not. I found myself wanting to do something that was more focused on the human experience, to see where I would be able to work directly with end users of my work to constantly iterate and improve to build better impact. I wanted to seek out something beyond simply making a bungalow or skyscraper prettier for a single property owner. I wanted my designs to have a positive impact on many people, to improve experiences and to remove the frustrations that others face. Most of all, I wanted to find meaning in my work. As I was exploring options outside the industry, I was also working towards taking the professional exam in my journey to qualify as an architect. Being an architect was a career path I had decided to embark upon all those years ago. Making a career change at that juncture felt like it was going against all I worked for and it felt like I was giving up before achieving my goals. Some friends also cautioned against making such a move, emphasising how doing so would be a waste of those five long years invested into getting a Master’s degree in a specialised field. To them, it seemed like a waste of time, money, and effort. I’d also worked for a year in the architecture field at that point. Friends were also concerned that I would be forgoing the opportunity to become a professional architect and the possibility of setting up my own practice, which they saw as something prestigious and illustrious. While they definitely had my interests at heart, I was also fortunate to have a counterweight in the advice of my family and other friends who encouraged me to explore new horizons while I was still young. They persuaded me to view things from a different perspective: that if my intention really was to create good designs to impact people, there were other ways to skin this cat. Despite their surprise at my decision, it was through the help of my supportive friends that I landed my current role as a workplace experience designer in late 2021 at DBS' Corporate Real Estate Strategy and Administration team. In my current job, my team and I work by observing users, soliciting their feedback, and conducting experiments to find out what works best for them. For instance, as part of the bank’s effort to create purposeful spaces for hybrid work, my teammates and I ran pilots to design “ideation rooms” to enhance productivity and creativity which were based on behavioural research. We designed these purpose-built spaces to be used for brainstorming workshops, but occupying the space to make conference calls would be a poor utilisation of their value, impeding their use for those who need them most. To nudge intended behaviour, we placed atypical meeting room furniture such as stools and standing desks to create an atypical meeting setting, whilst also encouraging active participation to keep workshops focused. To catalyse recycling habits among staff members, my team and I prototyped intuitive recycling bins and educational nudges. We experimented with reducing vending machine usage and optimising food waste management in our two staff cafeterias. Ultimately, it’s about tailoring workspaces to meet needs. Unlike an architect whose role is largely done once the building is built, as a workspace designer, it also means continuously monitoring and dealing with user feedback so that the design of spaces, or otherwise, can be improved upon. While some may scoff at the idea that I’ve moved away from designing buildings to create office waste bins, I do not see this job as any less important or prestigious. To me, the expanded scope of what I am doing now is an exciting challenge and getting to work on a wide variety of projects was something I looked forward to in my work. I was lucky to be able to make this career transition without a significant financial impact on myself. At the end of the day, workplace experience design is a different trade from architecture. To me, I derive more meaning from creating a good working environment for many more people than I did as an architect. Spaces are meant to be used by people, and so their designs can either elevate or detract from their purposes. I know that the work I do thus has an outsized impact on more people who actually need to work in these buildings. Nearly two years into this new role, I continue to learn and grow each day. While transitioning from architecture to experience design required a significant shift in focus, I was thankful that my university education in design thinking had helped to ease the change. On this note, my career switch might not be as drastic or a complete change as many others, but the personal journey I had to go through to find meaning in work was still a challenge. I still needed to overcome my mental hurdles. Looking back, I always had a choice of what I wanted to be committing my time and energy to. Not everyone might make the same choices I did if they were in my situation, since one can find meaning in work in many ways. Some choose to dive deep into their passions, others look squarely at the money they make from work, or some see the impact they leave behind from their work as the most important factor of all. What matters is that you have to decide what is important to you. And at the end of the day, when you find out what that is, know that it is better to have tried something that might not work out than to regret not trying at all.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Ever since I started working part-time in secondary school, I have been a florist salesman, a plumber, a bartender, a club entertainer, and a tattoo artist to make ends meet. Gen Y speaks writer Justin Chua. Ever since I started working part-time in secondary school, I have been a florist salesman, a plumber, a bartender, a club entertainer, and a tattoo artist to make ends meet. As one can tell from my eclectic portfolio of job experiences, I had been moving from job to job, with each new stint vastly different from the last. I enjoyed what I was doing at times, but along the way, I began to feel a missing sense of purpose in my life. I was just getting by in jobs simply by earning my way to justify the lifestyle I led. I wasn’t concerned about the bigger picture, about what my role in the world is, or about finding my own self-actualisation and potential. Like a bolt from the blue, this revelation that I needed to find a purpose-filled career struck me three years ago during the pandemic. For the first time, I felt a calling in the most unlikely of places — the maritime industry. But before that, it took me a tediously long journey to find my stable ground. Growing up, I shunned subjects like mathematics and science but loved hands-on topics like art and design. By the time I graduated from secondary school, I had a shelf of sketchbooks that contained design renders, creatures from my imagination, and beautiful things that I wanted to remember. At the time, however, my interest in art felt more like a hobby. I became quite the adventurous happy-go-lucky guy as I grew older and tried many part-time jobs. So, I tried being a florist salesman, a bartender, and even a club performer. The experiences were great, but none felt like the perfect fit. Life took an interesting turn at 21 after a chat with my family’s plumber. He didn’t have any kids and wanted to impart his skills to an apprentice. I needed some money and a part-time job. So, I thought, why not? The creative problem-solving aspect that came with being a plumber energised me. For example, I had to think of creative solutions on the spot, like using unconventional rubber bands or washers to fix leaks. When I was 22, I took up an Advanced Diploma in Business and Management Studies and graduated more than a year later at the East Asia Institute of Management. Nevertheless, I found myself at a crossroads with mounting financial pressures, and I didn’t have a silver spoon that could see me through this phase of my life. You see, I wanted to live in my own place and support myself independently. I also wanted to pursue a degree, but the course fees were expensive. Unfortunately, I couldn’t afford this with the low pay plumbing apprentices get, and it would also take me years before I became a master. This dilemma was what kickstarted my tattooing chapter. Like sketching, tattooing was a deep interest of mine, and I learned from industry friends how lucrative it could be. So, I decided to forgo my further education to enter tattooing full-time. It felt like the right choice as I valued my financial and personal independence. Being a tattoo artist was eye-opening. I discovered that I enjoyed understanding and engaging people. Tattooing is not just about drawing on people’s bodies. It’s about empathising with people’s experiences and turning them into meaningful art. With a well-paying and enjoyable job, I thought being a tattoo artist was the endgame for me. I went from experimenting with tattoos on my own body (and some brave friends) to having regular clients. In a good month, I could earn between S$4,000 and S$5,000. Unfortunately, the pandemic in 2020 also caused a crisis for me. I lost my source of income as all local tattoo studios were shuttered indefinitely. I was at my lowest point emotionally. I found myself without a regular income, no place to stay, and without purpose. I moved back in with my parents and tried freelance jobs to stay afloat, but I lacked the discipline to make a freelance career work in the long run. At this point, I knew I needed a job that could give me a routine. After a challenging job search, a lifeline emerged when I finally got a maritime operations role in ShipsFocus. I had no clue about the maritime industry, but I needed the job. My first few months were challenging. For example, I was terrible with data and hated using software to crunch shipping and cargo numbers. As a result, I made many mistakes. However, I knew this was an important opportunity for me. Drawing on the service and hustle mindset from my bartending days, I improved my performance. I regularly sought feedback and was extra careful with my work. I even went the extra mile like cleaning the office, making tea for visitors, answering calls, and running office errands. Eventually, the company’s chief operating officer James Kim noticed how well I could connect with people. To take full advantage of this strength of mine, he subsequently carved out a business development role for me, and the team also gave me the space to learn more about shipping. I found myself easing into the role quickly thanks to my colleagues’ support. It was their faith in me that allowed me to earn my sea legs in the industry. Today, I am a maritime and operations specialist helping shipping companies to digitalise efficiently and sustainably. In my day-to-day life, I persuade shipping personnel to use our software to execute daily tasks, instead of relying on emails, phone calls, or faxes. The job soon grew on me, as I realised that despite the completely different skill sets involved, I was frequently reminded of my past jobs. When I engage maritime stakeholders to understand their needs and challenges, I remember my time as a tattoo artist working with clients and their needs. When I find creative digital solutions for their operational challenges, I feel the same satisfaction I had as a plumber trying to fix a leak. My biggest realisation was that I was working for something larger than myself. I discovered that maritime was not a staid and outdated industry, but a rapidly transforming sector full of exciting opportunities. By helping ship companies to digitalise, I’m not just supporting myself, but building an important legacy in an industry that never sleeps. That was what motivated me to overcome my rough start. Because of one success with a recent deal I managed to clinch, my boss has officially christened me as “Justin 2.0”. My next step is to start upskilling myself to repay the faith my bosses had in me. I’m on my way to becoming “Justin 3.0”, by learning new skills in user experience design, digital marketing, and programming. I live by a mantra — Aut inveniam viam aut faciam — which in Latin means “I shall either find a way or make a way”. When life keeps throwing curveballs in my direction, I have always found a way out. Even when I struggled through the pandemic and an unexpected career switch, I was able to find a way. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m in control. I have a future-ready job, a financially responsible lifestyle, a steady routine, and a renewed focus in life.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Growing up, I was overweight and was used to hearing comments about my size. Growing up, I was overweight and was used to hearing comments about my size. I remember how in my primary school days, I had to go to the “Trim and Fit Club” everyday before morning assembly for additional exercise to keep me in shape. But because positive change doesn’t happen overnight, my fellow classmates would remark callously: “Why are you still so fat?” My friends would toss such comments my way If they saw me changing into my exercise kit in class, making mean jokes at my expense, and then laugh about it afterwards. Ultimately, these were wisecracks that I wasn’t meant to take seriously. But I know that at the time, it hurt to be the butt of their jokes. What also affected me were the actions by my well-meaning family members too. To help me lose weight, my parents would pass me health shakes and dietary supplements. It reminded me that there was something wrong with my weight. Mealtimes no longer became a source of enjoyment, but a constant battle trying to control my flaws and resist temptation. Whenever I looked at the mirror, I looked for imperfections like my flabby tummy, rather than the good aspects of myself. From the childish banter from my friends, the pre-assembly exercises that I had to do that others didn’t, and the nutritional shakes my parents insisted on, all of these gradually reinforced my own understanding of body weight and dietary habits. So, I tried everything I knew to lose weight. I would drink juices blended from lemon peels, celery, and bitter gourd. According to urban myth, bitter flavours are supposed to help. In any case, whether it was due to my efforts or by nature, I did lose weight as I grew older. Relatives remarked at how fit I looked. But my extreme negativity towards obesity hadn’t changed. I am ashamed to admit that it was me who became the aggressor. This time, I was the person who dished out obesity jokes instead of being at the receiving end of them. During 2008, when swine flu had just broken out in this part of the world, I remember how among my friends, joking about someone’s weight became a popular joke. I recall how I would remark that one particular overweight friend looked like a “swine”, which would provoke uncontrollable laughs from my peers. This was even though I knew how much such comments hurt me previously. In my head at the time, it was normal for someone’s size to be joked about, because that was what happened to me in primary school. I didn’t realise how superficial my own understanding of a person’s body image and weight issues was, and how much I would regret making those comments, until I had my binge eating episodes. During a stressful time figuring out what course to take in university as a 21-year-old, I inexplicably began stuffing myself with everything I could get my hands on. I would tear through packets of cakes, cookies and chocolates, looking for the next sugar rush to distract me from the vague pit of anxiety I felt. All I knew was that I wanted my anxiety to disappear, and food seemed the easiest way to distract myself from it. it felt straightforward – find food, eat food, feel good. Bingeing was my way of exerting control over my circumstances, even though it was really a form of losing control. Realising that it was a problem, I saw a therapist, who taught me in my first meeting to write a letter of love to myself. Reading that out loud helped with my self-esteem. Things also became better after I started a part-time job as a tuition teacher, which helped me realise that I could contribute something to the young lives of these students, and put aside my own anxieties. All of these helped, but only temporarily. Three years later, when I graduated from university, I became anxious again trying to find a job. Once again, I turned to binge eating while hunting for a job. It was a vicious cycle that involved being worried about rejection from potential employers, experiencing guilt when bingeing, and feeling worse about myself when I see myself in the mirror. This time, when I saw my therapist, he suggested that I see a psychiatrist. Eventually, I was put on antidepressants. What also helped greatly was when I joined a group called Overeaters Anonymous. It was a 12-step group modelled after the likes of Alcoholics Anonymous. When I joined in September 2019, it was regularly attended by four to seven people who faced similar problems as me. At these weekly sessions, I would meet others who were also dealing with eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia, and binge eating. In a safe space such as this, I became open to sharing about what I was going through. The process helped me realise three things. One, that I wasn’t alone in my suffering. Two, that talking about my plight could support others who are also on the path of recovery too. Three, it was through such sharing that I realised how difficult it is for men to talk about the eating disorders they may be experiencing. Yet, men are not immune from body image issues, and like women, need all the help we can get to overcome their situation. It is perhaps an unfortunate byproduct of masculinity that men share less about their emotions. I remember a male friend from primary school once telling me about his struggle with bulimia. He spoke how he would stuff his finger down his throat, to induce a gagging reflex to vomit out what he ate. He was slender and tall. You wouldn’t have expected him to suffer from an eating disorder. When I happened to see him years later, I asked how he was coping with the eating disorder he had shared previously, because I was also trying to cope with mine. There was a flash of fear in his eyes, before he said, “Me? Maybe you remembered wrongly.” It is because of how much talking about my journey openly helped me in trying to deal with my eating disorders, that I decided to pen this column about my experience. We’ve all heard the advice to “talk about it” and to consult with a professional if we feel down. But I want to stress how important such advice is, especially for men who are reticent about reaching out for help. I know because I felt the same worries about how people might perceive me as being a wimp, or that it was a form of giving up control over my personal situation, even though as I said earlier, binge eating was, in reality, an unhealthy coping mechanism. But in the absence of such positive open sharing, any male talk about body weight and eating disorders become monopolised by toxic jokes and harmful stereotypes, as I can fully attest to from my childhood. And that just makes things a lot worse.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks As a principal of a childcare centre today, I have to admit that the idea of working with preschool children had never crossed my mind when I was growing up. Gen Y Speaks writer Puvaneswary G Tanagopal photographed with students. As a principal of a childcare centre today, I have to admit that the idea of working with preschool children had never crossed my mind when I was growing up. In my youth, all of my passions and career ambitions were linked to numbers and computers, and I was enamoured by how technology can change people’s lives. The allure of computers in my younger days opened my mind to the possibilities, and as a result, I pursued a Diploma in Information Technology at Nanyang Polytechnic. At the time, I thought my options were quite straightforward. Study hard, get good grades, and enter the industry of my choice. Life seemed set on a comfortable trajectory. As I delved deeper into the world of IT, I found myself piqued by how complex systems operate, and how the ones and zeros make everything tick as it should. There was joy in understanding how numbers work. In this process, I also gained interest to consider accountancy as a possible career path, due to my growing interest in mathematics, and I believed it was a world where I could excel in. So, after graduating in 2007, I entered the world of finance and human resources, making my way through various industries, including advertising and IT over the next nine years. In this time, one of my most memorable and fulfilling moments was being involved in financial audits and developing communications plans to update employees about a merger that my company was going through. Despite it being a challenging period for my former company, it also provided me with a unique opportunity for growth, as what I did at the time had a large impact on my fellow colleagues’ livelihoods. But the winds of change blew into my life in 2016. At the time, I had been regularly babysitting my niece, a toddler, over the weekends. I remember one instance when I was rote counting, and she repeated what I said for the first time. My niece’s reaction to this made me feel like I accomplished something immense, and she made my heart flutter in a way that I never felt before. It was through experiences like these that left a lasting impression about childhood development. Slowly, I began to appreciate the intricacies of caring for a child. A child’s mind was far more complex than the computers and financial systems I was already so familiar with. And so, as my curiosity about early childhood development grew, it became clear that my heart was leading me in a different direction. I found myself at a career crossroads. I now yearned for something different in my career path — a chance to find a new purpose and passion. But I realised that switching careers into the early childhood sector was not a simple feat. It meant bridging a significant knowledge gap and attaining certifications to be a qualified educator. It was a daunting prospect, but the chance of being a part of a child's first formal learning experience ignited a passion within me that I couldn't ignore. In May that year, an opportunity knocked on my door as I saw an online job advertisement for an assistant teacher position in Sengkang. Without much hesitation, I applied. The preschool, Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale, was located close to my home, and despite my lack of credentials in early childhood development, the management gave me a chance and offered me a job. I remember being excited but also nervous, because this was the stepping stone I needed to transition into this new world. What made it even more promising was the support the management provided by enrolling me in Workforce Singapore's Career Conversion Programme for Preschool Educators. This was a lifeline, especially for mid-career switchers like me, as it allowed me to juggle work and study simultaneously. Over a period of 13 months, I immersed myself in the curriculum, absorbing valuable insights into classroom management strategies. I learned how to navigate the labyrinth of emotions in young children and discovered a plethora of engagement techniques to foster a positive learning environment. It also prepared me to take on the role of a mentor teacher, guiding and supporting newer educators in their journey. More importantly, I was trained to ensure that safety protocols were met. In a nutshell, the comprehensive training taught me the ropes to become a confident and skilled preschool educator. One surprising aspect of this journey was the realisation that I am still able to put my previous work experiences to good use. My computer skills found a home in preparing documents for the childcare centre, adding a technical edge to my current role. My problem-solving skills translated seamlessly into the classroom as I helped preschool children and teachers navigate the challenges they encountered. For example, we employ an open and transparent communication between the teachers and parents, which helps when conflicts occur. Just as it was in my former company that was undergoing a merger, clear communication, when done in a constructive manner, will lead to better understanding and collaboration among everyone involved. I completed the programme in 2017, and with it, I achieved a professional Diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education. It was a moment of immense pride for me to accomplish such a feat at 30. With my newfound knowledge and passion, my career in early childhood took flight. I started as an English teacher that same year. As the years passed, I continued to grow and evolve in this field, taking on more responsibilities and mentoring new educators who were just beginning their journey. It was thrilling to be part of a child's first formal learning experience. Earlier this year, I reached a milestone I could have never imagined back when I was crunching numbers and managing finances. As I sit down to reflect on my journey, I know my career has taken an unorthodox path, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It was a hard decision to leave my comfort zone doing something that I was familiar with, and to explore a new world in childhood development. But looking back, it was also one of the most rewarding choices I've made. Each day, I wake up knowing that I can make a difference in the lives of these young children, to nurture their curiosity and instil in them the love of learning that may serve them for a lifetime. I am also deeply committed to supporting my team of teachers in maintaining and enhancing the quality of education in our centre. But while my journey has been a meaningful one, I can't ignore the fact that the early childhood sector in Singapore faces manpower challenges. While there's a growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education, there remains a significant shortage of qualified educators. Last October, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) said the annual attrition rate in the sector hovered between 10 and 15 per cent over the last few years, in a workforce of about 23,000 people. Singapore needs another 3,500 teachers by 2025, the agency said then. In my view, attracting and retaining talent can also be challenging as the profession is physically demanding and also requires a considerable emotional investment in young children. The expectations of parents have also changed towards childcare centres and preschools that offer holistic development opportunities for their children. To keep pace with evolving expectations, I know my industry would need to adopt new learning approaches and adapt to these changes. With safety in preschools being in the limelight recently, we take a proactive approach to ensure the safety of the children in our care. This involves regular safety audits, implementing strict safety protocols, and providing training to staff on child protection and safety measures. What all these changes also mean is that there is an opportunity for every educator to pick up newer skills and to develop their career in more meaningful ways. As the principal of Greenland Childcare @ Fernvale now, I am entrusted with the responsibility of guiding not only the young minds in our care but also the dedicated team of teachers who work with me. My learning journey, however, did not come to an end. To further develop my career and leadership skills, I embarked on an Advanced Diploma in Early Childhood Leadership at the National Institute of Early Childhood Development. This allowed me to refine my skills in leadership and people management, qualities essential for my role as a principal who is expected to inspire my team of educators. At my centre, for example, we provide mentorship and support to address career progression concerns, with the more experienced educators mentoring the newer ones. For anyone who is contemplating a switch into this industry from another career, there are a bevy of options available to learn the skills needed, as I found out too. Being a preschool educator comes with a multitude of rewards, both intrinsic and extrinsic, that make it a fulfilling and meaningful career. Witnessing a child’s first steps or their first words is an unforgettable experience. Also, each day in a preschool setting is unique, and can be filled with surprises and moments of discovery. This variety keeps the work interesting and dynamic. I’m glad I took that first step to make a mid-career switch all those years ago. It is a journey filled with its own set of challenges, but I know the impact that I’ve made on the lives of the young minds under my care is immeasurable. Because of that, it is a voyage worth taking. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks In May, Singapore athletes did the nation proud by hauling home 51 gold, 43 silver and 64 bronze medals from the Southeast Asia (Sea) Games in Cambodia. Mr Dale Liu Dong Liang, 38, a banker with DBS and a national underwater hockey player. He represented Singapore in the 2019 Sea Games. In May, Singapore athletes did the nation proud by hauling home 51 gold, 43 silver and 64 bronze medals from the Southeast Asia (Sea) Games in Cambodia. I remember how I managed to catch some of the sporting action on meWATCH, cheering on Team Singapore from the comfort of my home. It brought back vivid memories about my own 2019 Sea Games experience as a member of the Singapore Men’s underwater hockey team. That adrenaline rush of competitive sports, along with the pride and joy of representing your country was simply unforgettable. That year, underwater hockey made its debut in the games, which was held in the Philippines. By the sheer combined effort of everyone in the Singapore national team and the support staff, we made a clean sweep by bringing home four gold medals in both the men and women categories respectively. I remember how jubilant I felt when the national anthem played as my team and I stood on the top step of the podium. I was proud, not just for the country, but also for bringing greater exposure to this wonderful sport that involves trying to hit a puck across the bottom of a swimming pool into the other team's goal with a hockey stick, without the aid of breathing devices. I recall feeling how all the blood, sweat and tears that I put into the sport — which is still a self-funded sport in Singapore — finally paid off. Singapore has traditionally excelled in water sports, such as swimming and water polo. Unfortunately, underwater hockey was not included in the most recent Sea Games. Even though this was a bitter pill to swallow, my teammates and I continue to train together with the Underwater Hockey Association of Singapore to make this little known sport more accessible to the wider public. But doing so also requires surmounting several sizable hurdles placed along our way. For one, as a self-funded sport, each one of us has to cough up our own funds to purchase equipment and engage overseas coaches, even as we are all on the national team. That also means having to attend overseas training camps in Australia, which are a fundamental part of our Sea Games preparations. Over the six-month period leading up to the Sea Games, I had to fork out about S$15,000, which is a substantial sum for anyone. The issue of sports funding is a tricky one, because there are realistically only two avenues where funds can come from — public and private. But for lesser-known sports like underwater hockey, private sponsors aren’t necessarily keen, whereas public funds need to be directed judiciously to various sports. Much has been said earlier this year about uphill challenges faced by self-funded athletes, such as the Singapore’s women tchoukball team that became the world number one despite the fact that the sport is also entirely self-funded. I’m no expert on the nuances of sports funding, but I know what it is like for sportsmen to remain competitive in such an environment. While most of my teammates and I could simply rely on the pay cheques from our day jobs, I know that some of my younger teammates struggled to raise funds. One of them, in particular, was still schooling and she had difficulty paying for her flight ticket to competitions. She would have lost the opportunity of representing Singapore, were it not for a few of her teammates from the women’s national team who came together and offered to help with her expenses. The “catch” was that she had to pay it forward, and commit to coaching the next batch of promising athletes. Funding isn’t the only challenge that we face. For one, we need to train in the deeper middle section of swimming pools of Singapore, but because most pools only allow bookings along the length, and not the breadth, it’s hard to find suitable training venues. It was frustrating having to contend with these logistical issues while also trying to be at the top of our game, such as the case for us in the 2019 Sea Games. Despite all these challenges, which at times made me contemplate leaving the sport, I chose to stay on, because I firmly believe the future is bright for the sport. For me, I am also not spared from needing to juggle a corporate career with my sporting endeavours. As someone working in a bank, I have demanding nine-to-five work schedules. Luckily, my employer DBS provided me with additional paid leave, which gave me the peace of mind and financial security to remain focused on the task of competing for Team Singapore. But even then, the training commitment is significant. During non-competition periods, I still train about three to four times weekly. The frequency increases to about seven to 10 times weekly as we get closer to major competitions like the Sea Games or regional tournaments. When there were tight work deadlines to meet, I would resume work after training, often from 10pm onwards. As such, I am very grateful to work in an organisation and environment where everyone has been very supportive and understanding. It also helps that DBS’ family-friendly work culture and productivity tools enable me to work efficiently and effectively. Juggling work commitments and pursuing your sporting goals may be tough, but not impossible. First, make sure you surround yourself with a good support and social network. For example, I worked out a win-win arrangement with a friend who happens to be a nutritionist, who can help me out with meal preps for the week. Second, be flexible and adaptable. This may involve rescheduling workouts to accommodate an important work meeting or modifying your training regime. For team sports like underwater hockey, this may be easier said than done as I had to accommodate my schedules with others, who also have their own jobs or classes to contend with. While keeping a flexible schedule may not be easy, it helps to be organised and be clear about one’s priorities, so that sudden changes and demands do not become a source of stress. Which leads me to my final point, which is to learn how your body works and adapts to physical and mental stress, whether it is from work or from training. Showing up for training is the easy part. The hard part is maintaining the discipline to monitor your vitals daily such as your resting heart rate, so that you know when to tailor your training and work schedules to the limits of what your body can withstand. Knowing your body and adapting to its condition is instrumental to consolidate any gains to reach your sporting goals and at the same time, help to maintain energies at the workplace. To me, this is the most important advice I can give for anyone who finds themselves in this position of being a full-time office worker and a part-time national sportsman. Because if I do not get the balance right, all of this would be unsustainable, and I would have to eventually give up on my dreams. As long as it is physically possible, I will continue to do my best to bring Singapore glory in the pool, while striving to achieve my personal career goals.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks I remember being a “victim” of the 5.5-day work week as a student in the late 1990s. I remember being a “victim” of the 5.5-day work week as a student in the late 1990s. Instead of the five-day work week that officially began in the civil service in 2004, the norm at the time was to work for an additional half a day over the weekends. Like most Singaporeans, my parents had work to attend to every Saturday morning, and this expectation trickled down to school as well. Even at the age of nine, I vividly recall my bitterness at missing the Saturday morning cartoons that played on TV, because for a year in primary school, my stern and hardworking Chinese teacher decided the whole class needed to come back for supplementary classes. In a way, my life still has not changed much. Although society moved to a five-day work week by the time my friends and I entered the workforce, most of us usually end up working “unofficially” on weekends. It’s almost impossible to arrange to meet my best friend, who works in insurance, on weekend mornings, as she always has client appointments at that time. The teachers I know often spend their weekends poring over lesson plans too in that timeframe. And if you count the hours, for those who work desk-bound jobs, a work-free weekend would usually mean burning through late nights on weekdays. So now that the talk of a four-day work week has surfaced, I am sceptical of how it would work in Singapore. In July 2021, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng opened the doors to the four-day work week by saying that any employer who wishes to implement it for their employees is allowed to since there are no legal obstacles. In 2022, researchers in Britain launched a trial in which 61 organisations and about 2,900 workers voluntarily adopted truncated work weeks, and found that at the conclusion of the experiment, most companies did not want to go back to the five-day standard. Recently, I’ve seen job ads of some companies here in Singapore dangling such carrots in front of prospective jobseekers, promising better work-life balance with shorter working hours and flexible work arrangements. Maybe I’m just inefficient, but can most of us really complete all our tasks in four days? For one, as a freelance writer, I already determine the hours and days that I work. And it so happens that I find myself working on weekends sometimes. Don’t get me wrong: Just the thought of a shorter work week makes me happy. It is the exact feeling people get when they anticipate a long weekend. This is a list of things I would probably do in that free time: And if a four-day work week really does become a reality, hopefully my friends and family members would also share the same schedule so that we could meet up more often. At this point, you might be thinking that my plans seem frivolous. I admit that they definitely do not sound like the most productive way to spend time. I’m slightly sheepish to say that at this moment, I have no plans to go for a SkillsFuture course to upgrade myself, though I recognise that lifelong learning does make a difference to boost employability. If I spent fewer days in the office, would I use my free time on personal and career development? I’m not sure if I will. But I am quite sure that, at least from a psychological perspective, I would feel more relaxed and content. After all, there is research that shows that people who are less stressed are better at their jobs. Besides that, why does it always need to boil down to productivity? I can imagine the concerns about manpower shortages and logistics nightmares with a four-day work week. I already hear warnings about how the costs would be passed on to consumers. I was horrified to read about the 9-9-6 (9am to 9pm, six days a week) culture in tech companies in China recently. Could the “lying flat” movement in China – which is described as people opting out of the culture of overwork and consumerism – be a result of this reality? China is also facing rising youth unemployment. In June, its unemployment rate in June was a record-breaking 21.3 per cent , and the country stopped publishing the statistic in August. For a moment, I even considered myself lucky that I was far away from such a work culture. But I was recently shocked to hear the announcement that preschools in Singapore will scrap the requirement for a six-day work week and align with the five-day work week normal from Jan 1, 2025. One reason for the change, other than the fact that most parents don’t need the Saturday service, is that it could promote better working conditions and attract more people to the industry. As pointed out in a recent Big Read by TODAY , experts said the real issue is the heavy workload, which makes it seemingly impossible to cram all our tasks into four days. But I believe a change is near, that is if my conversations with my friends are any indication. They stay in their jobs, not solely because of passion or ambition, but because the job pays them well enough to sustain their wants and needs. And this includes paying for that plane ticket to get away from work. At this point, I know that some might scoff at the lack of drive or hunger at work, and how it used to be like “back in the day”. But there is no shame if vacations are your main motivation for working. Wanting a break from work should not be seen as laziness either. In many countries, many young people are no longer convinced that slogging away is the only route to happiness, but they also want to be able to afford their vacations. In Singapore, many people my age probably feel the same too. We don’t need to be working to the bone, but we want to be more efficient and not be penalised for completing our work earlier so that we can have more time for ourselves. A survey of Singapore youths between 18 and 35 last year showed that two-thirds of respondents wanted a four-day work week, even if it meant working longer hours each day. Also significant was the fact that about 70 per cent also felt that it was possible to achieve their long-term goals without working beyond traditional office hours. Hopefully, all of these means that managing to fulfil one’s task in four days – instead of five – would look good on a resume or performance appraisal. Anecdotally, however, the most efficient and effective workers are often the most overworked, because they are often “rewarded” with extra work instead. To me, changing such mindsets will need well-defined job scopes, firm deadlines, and respect for others’ working hours – we need to leave the people on leave alone. For managers, it means recognising that just because a worker completed their task early, they shouldn’t be saddled with more. Which leads me to my next point: A shorter work week could really encourage us to be more efficient. This is coming from me, a self-professed procrastinator who always seems to find speed and inspiration when deadlines are approaching. Working from home has shown us that there are many inefficiencies involved when working in an office. As someone who has worked briefly in a very “old-school” workplace, I can think of some examples: long meetings, the prep that goes behind these long meetings, and long coffee breaks (I’m guilty of this one!). I would like to believe these office quirks mean there is definitely room to work more efficiently. I remember the late nights in the office with no fondness, wondering to myself if I should’ve avoided dilly-dallying earlier in the day so I could head off earlier. Although I usually had other long-suffering colleagues for company, I’m sure we definitely would have preferred to be hanging out somewhere else, instead of having to deal with inconsiderate people who send us urgent emails when the work day is almost over. There might come a day when employers might be more open to giving their workers the choice of a four-day work week. Of course, some might choose to work for longer hours and more days, because they are worried that it would translate to more stress at work each day. But one could also make it a goal to work in a more efficient and disciplined way, and reap the rewards of one’s labour over a well-earned long weekend.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks As someone who has been through medical school and currently working as a doctor, I thought I fully understood the importance of being empathetic to those going through a hard time because of their medical conditions. As someone who has been through medical school and currently working as a doctor, I thought I fully understood the importance of being empathetic to those going through a hard time because of their medical conditions. But it was my first-hand experience being a patient that drove home the necessity of empathy. For a spell last month, I was admitted into a public hospital for six days, which was the first time in my life that I needed to be hospitalised. I became one of six female patients warded in a C-class ward at Sengkang General Hospital due to a skin infection on my legs, which required intravenous antibiotics. This was the same sterile, starch-white environment that my brain naturally associated with work, examining patients and communicating with their families. As I watched healthcare workers shuffle around pushing wheelchairs, beds and “cows” (or Computer on Wheels, a term we use to identify the mobile trolley containing medical equipment), I couldn’t help but wonder at the organised chaos that seems to keep the healthcare system chugging away. It is no surprise that my experience with the hospital staff and the medical side of things was nothing short of excellent. That said, the familiar buzz of a hospital ward did little to distract me from the itch and pain of my own plight, and reading or surfing the internet did not work either. For one, I began to feel that I was a liability to my other doctor co-workers, who had to do the heavy lifting in my absence. Perhaps it was the contrast of me lying helplessly in a bed while other hospital staff busied themselves in the ward that made me feel this way. Falling sick, being admitted and subsequently requiring follow-up appointments meant time taken away from work, the inability to follow up on my usual projects and other work. As someone who has not really fallen so ill to such an extent before, I had not known how much time was needed to travel to the various medical appointments, and the energy needed to wait in a clinic lounge or a hospital food court while suffering from the symptoms of my condition. I also hadn’t realised how challenging it was trying to change the dates of follow-up appointments to fit my own work schedule. Instead, it was easier to simply take a leave of absence from work. It also meant scrambling to readjust my work schedules because I needed time away for hospitalisation. To be clear, nobody at my workplace blamed me for being on hospitalisation or sick leave. But I still felt a degree of guilt towards my administrative staff, who had to go through the trouble of finding someone else to take over my work. I also felt apologetic towards my patients, who saw me as their regular doctor and were not keen on alternatives that might inconvenience them. I know it is an irrational thought, but at the time I felt like I was an unproductive member of society and a burden to the people around me. Sharing this episode with my friends led to a conversation on similar feelings of internal guilt in unexpected circumstances such as illness, bereavement, caregiving issues and even pregnancy. Any small gesture was greatly appreciated while I was warded. I recall how my clinic manager came all the way to visit me in the hospital, bringing along a sponge cake to wish me well. She also updated me on what’s been going on at work and gave me words of encouragement. She wasn’t the only one to check in on me. My other co-workers stepped in to follow up on my patients and also took the effort to ask about my condition from time to time, reassuring me that there was nothing to worry about. I was moved by what they did for me, at a time when I was feeling like I was being a burden to them. Their kind words of empathy assuaged my anxieties and allowed me to focus on healing. This is why I firmly believe that we should build an empathetic society where people are mindful, tactful and cognizant of others’ circumstances and needs, especially those with invisible struggles. And it starts by being kind to each other because you never know if someone is going through a rough patch. I must confess that even though I am a recently turned 30-year-old doctor, I’ve not internalised the idea of memento mori (Latin for “remember you must die”), until now. Everyone will meet their maker at some point, but for most millennials like myself, I suspect our own mortality is not something we think about. Even my years of medical education and working in healthcare didn’t stop me from neglecting to make early plans for accidents and serious illnesses. As such, I only realised that my hospitalisation insurance is woefully inadequate and that I am only seeking to upgrade it now. I was shocked to find out that my hospitalisation bill had to be paid for through Medisave and Medishield Life at this point, because my integrated shield plan is an old policy of the lowest tier without a co-pay rider. When I shared my hospital stay experience on social media, some friends reached out to me and shared their unexpected diagnoses with illnesses including cancer and diabetes even at a young age. Some expressed regret at not having made plans earlier, as they became uninsurable after a major diagnosis. It is my hope that others and myself will find the right amount of insurance, safety nets and planning to meet their needs, as being under or over-insured can have costly outcomes. In the end, no matter how physically active, accomplished or emotionally strong one is, nobody is invincible. Everyone, even healthcare workers like myself, is vulnerable at the doors of death and disease. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Alvona Loh Zi Hui is a medical doctor who works in Singapore.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Throughout my journey of recovering from the accident, physiotherapists were the professionals who consistently helped me heal, enabling me to avoid surgery. Grateful and inspired by them, I held onto the hope that one day I could do the same for someone else. Alfian Bin Redzuan (left) attending to a patient at Ren Ci Community Hospital. As long as I can remember, I’ve always had a passion for sports. I was on the track-and-field team at my secondary school, competing in discus throw events, and later went on to play rugby throughout junior college and university. I kept up with rugby until 2017, when a car accident compelled me to reconsider my involvement in the sport. The accident left me with neck pain and spondylolisthesis leading to lower back pain and numbness in both my legs — injuries which made me fearful of continuing with sports and other strenuous activities. My orthopaedic specialist cautioned me to stop playing touch rugby, warning that I might need spinal fusion surgery in the near future (a major surgery to enhance spinal stability). I was in emotional turmoil. I had hoped to keep playing rugby well into my 50s. But I now found myself torn between continuing what I loved and potentially needing a major, risky surgery. As an only child, I worried about the possible impact on my career and my family. A single accident could affect my income, my future, and my ability to support my parents. “Would I still be able to play with my nephews and nieces?” I wondered. “Would I even be able to carry them?” Throughout my journey of recovering from the accident, physiotherapists were the professionals who consistently helped me heal, enabling me to avoid surgery. When the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) launched its joint Physiotherapy degree programme with Trinity College Dublin in 2016, I did not hesitate to answer a calling that had been lingering in my mind since my youth. Grateful and inspired by the physiotherapists who aided me over the years, I held onto the hope that one day I could do the same for someone else. However, about a decade ago, pursuing physiotherapy as a standalone degree programme in local universities was not an option. So, I pursued a degree in philosophy and gained work experience in the public sector and, most recently, at SIT's Student Life division. My career took a significant turn when SIT introduced its four-year Physiotherapy degree programme and, later, Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Allied Health Professionals. This prompted me to enrol in 2019, joining the second cohort of CCP students. Transitioning back into student life at the age of 31 was no small feat. I had to immerse myself in complex theories about the human body and the deep knowledge that informs clinical recommendations for physiotherapists. The teaching faculty, many of whom were practicing physiotherapists, imparted practical industry knowledge through patient anecdotes. In adapting to the rigours of the degree programme, I faced personal challenges as an adult learner. For instance, my younger peers were more comfortable with online and digital interactions, while I preferred face-to-face and physical interactions, and our differing preferences posed something of a communication barrier. I also encountered what I can only describe as a \"body clock mismatch\". Many of my peers could work late into the night, but I'm an early riser. This made it difficult for me to sync our study times and keep up with late-night group discussions and revision sessions. It was a challenge to balance my academic commitments with my natural energy rhythms. Outside of school, my friends were advancing in their careers and their family lives, and it often felt as though I was hitting the reset button and starting from scratch once more. However, many of my loved ones were supportive of my decision — some even expressed envy at my courage in being willing to start afresh. Their encouragement went a long way towards motivating me to press on and was a source of comfort whenever I felt disheartened when facing challenges during my studies. Comparing myself to my book-smart classmates in the programme also led to moments of self-doubt, but the camaraderie and support among our cohort alleviated those concerns. The university's holistic training emphasised not only academic knowledge but also essential people skills and problem-solving abilities gained through work experience. Besides written exams, our evaluations included oral reasoning, practical sessions with standardised patients, and five six-week clinical placements at healthcare institutions. There's no substitute for the real-life lessons you gain from clinical placements. I’ve had the opportunity to attend attachments at different healthcare institutions, ranging from acute hospitals to organisations providing longer-term healthcare services within the community. These experiences gave me a better perspective of the rehabilitation journey of patients, some of whom were grappling with recent life-changing events such as stroke and limb amputation. I also interacted with patients rebuilding their endurance while dealing with the prolonged sequalae of Covid-19 infection and hospitalisation. Throughout, I had the opportunity to work closely with my clinical educators and buddies who were integral to my learning and personal development. The key lesson I've learned is the importance of adaptability because no two patients are the same. Consider, for example, the different care required for a 40-year-old who has suffered a heart attack compared to a 75-year-old heart patient with additional conditions like failing kidneys and frailty. Furthermore, patient attitudes and temperament can vary significantly; some are cooperative and mild, while others may be more emotional and impatient. Despite the challenges, my ultimate goal remains unchanged: To positively impact patients with chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes, as well as their family members. My hope is to improve their quality of life, even if it means enabling something as simple as a visit to a nearby coffee shop, and minimising their chances of hospital re-admission. I’m now working as a physiotherapist at Ren Ci Community Hospital. Even though I’ve accomplished my career dream, I recognise that I still have much to learn. I humbly acknowledge that I am far from being a ‘finished product’. Each day presents an opportunity for me to learn from my patients about their health and life experiences, shaping me into a better healthcare professional. I have learnt to be adaptable and to seek support when I feel it is necessary. Each of us is on our own individual journey, and while some paths may seem longer than others, the things we encounter along the way all work to contribute to our unique life experiences. Lastly, I’ve learnt that even in the face of great challenges, I can find ways to turn pain and strife to my benefit. Even when skies are dark and clouds are grey, there remains a silver lining to the struggles in life and a potential for growth. We just have to look for it.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks My journey in microbiome research has taught me to trust my gut. Now, I dream of one day developing ‘magic’ yoghurts that are tasty remedies for gut-related diseases such as mine. For Sylvester Lim, the significance of microbial therapeutics extends beyond public health: The prospect of being able to treat his own condition of IBS is inspiring. As a young boy who could not well discern fiction from reality, zombie films filled me with so much fear and fascination. If one bite or scratch was all it took to make me a brain eater, how would I react when I met one in person? As a kid, I liked to imagine what it would take to survive a zombie apocalypse: I often conjured scenarios of fortified Housing and Development Board flats and food stockpiles, all while planning escape routes in my mind. Not too long later, while I was studying biomedical science at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the Ebola epidemic emerged and raged throughout Africa. I remember being horrified by detailed descriptions of the disease symptoms, how the bleeding sounded reminiscent of the zombie films that had gripped me as a child. In an attempt to satisfy my curiosity about this disease, I read Richard Preston’s The Hot Zone. Seeing how scientific research could peer into the heart of such diseases inspired me to pursue my own research projects. At the National University of Singapore, I was grateful to be immersed in a research university where I was mentored by outstanding professors. While studying bacteria that caused nasty infections, I found myself pushed towards the boundaries of scientific knowledge. One experience in the lab that I would never forget was the first time my experiment confirmed a hypothesis I had. My professor remarked to me, “You are the first person in the world to learn about this.” To peer into the unknown and then discover something new was (and continues to be) an amazing feeling, but still I craved something bigger — something that could change lives. Upon learning that urinary tract infections are not only a common disease but also potentially deadly, I decided to study them next, in the hopes of leveraging my scientific curiosity to help the many people who suffer from it. Besides using advanced technology to study how to combat the disease, I also shared about my work with people outside the scientific world, helping non-scientists to understand the importance of my work. These experiences granted me my most valuable realisation yet: That my curiosity about the natural world could be harnessed towards alleviating people’s suffering. I wanted to be challenged and to explore new boundaries — even those outside of my comfortable sphere of infectious bacteria. I eventually became acquainted with an emerging field of bacteria research, that of bacterial communities called microbiomes that reside within our gut. My first introduction to microbiomes was through lectures and seminars by invited professors from Harvard and Johns Hopkins University. They demonstrated how gut bacteria manipulation had the potential to combat obesity. This caught my attention as a public health student, because obesity rates in Singapore are rising. The premise was riveting: Our gut hosts trillions of bacteria, which influence our health in a myriad of ways. Despite being such tiny life forms, they can impact our immune responses and how we metabolise food. This meant that adjusting the composition of these gut bacteria had the potential to help treat a variety of health conditions. I wondered: Could I combine my fascination with bacteria to help address prevalent public health issues, such as the chronic diseases increasingly prevalent in our ageing population? Thus, I pivoted my research towards microbiome therapeutics, focusing on how the manipulation of our gut bacteria can treat health conditions such as obesity-related diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. For me, the significance of microbial therapeutics extends beyond public health; it hits close to home. Having suffered from irritable bowel syndrome since my early teens, the prospect of being able to treat my condition is inspiring. I dream of one day developing ‘magic’ yoghurts that are tasty remedies for gut-related diseases such as mine. I will always be grateful that I attended university under the scholarship of A*Star. The scholarship provided me with opportunities beyond our borders: In July, I visited Japan as a representative of A*Star’s Bioinformatics Institute (BII). There, I showcased the work I did for one year at A*Star’s BII. Despite not having a common first language with some other attendees, our passion for scientific research allowed us to transcend such language barriers. Far beyond how we are often shown that science can be discretised into well-defined boundaries of Physics, Biology, and Chemistry, researchers at BII embrace the interconnectedness of these different disciplines. There, I answered biology questions through techniques enabled by statistics, chemistry, and physics. It is also this embracing of interdisciplinarity which has brought me today to the University of Oxford. For my PhD here, I hope to translate our knowledge on ecosystems into insights that allow us to manipulate the human gut microbiome for better health. We have come so far in understanding how the bacteria in our gut can impact our health. I believe that the study of the microbiome can one day allow us treat chronic diseases through novel ways that do not involve expensive long-term chemical-based medicines. Above all, each step I take in my research journey is an encouraging reminder to keep trusting my gut. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Sylvester Lim is a recipient of the A*STAR National Science Scholarship (PhD). He has worked on various scientific research projects spanning from computational drug discovery to infectious diseases. He has rewatched films like World War Z and Contagion countless times. Today, he researches on how to manipulate gut bacteria for better health. He hopes that one day, he will be able to develop yoghurt that allows foodie Singaporeans to eat anything without worrying about health consequences.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Finding a career that is enjoyable and fulfilling isn’t easy, but I’ve learnt that unexpected fields can offer the best of both worlds. For event organiser Ash Abdullah (centre), the satisfaction of seeing a project come together is akin to receiving a standing ovation at the end of a theatre performance. Since my childhood, the thrill of performing has been everything to me. I remember the first time I stepped onto the stage at age 10, heart pounding as I made my debut. The rush before going on stage, the bright lights, and the applause weren’t just moments; they were what defined my younger years. At the age of 18, I did a musical called Fame, which turned out to be one of the most unforgettable productions I have ever been a part of. It was my first time taking on a lead role where I had to act, sing and dance live in front of an audience. The rehearsals were gruelling, going for six hours at a time up to four times a week, but I enjoyed the camaraderie with the cast and crew. Working with different actors, musicians and dancers to deliver an exceptional performance brought me tremendous joy and fulfilment. Later in my teenhood, I started to wonder about the possibility of pursuing a career doing what I love, but I was apprehensive about going into theatre full-time as I wasn’t sure if my interests would change down the road. While I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do, I chanced upon the Diploma in Integrated Events Management course offered by Republic Polytechnic. From a tender age, I would volunteer to help plan and execute events at school and at home, including class fundraisers, sports day, birthday parties and even weddings. It never felt like a chore as I derived immense joy and satisfaction seeing how pleased my family and friends were with how well the events turned out. Although the diploma wasn’t directly related to theatre, it resonated with me nonetheless. I felt that the course could potentially provide an avenue to integrate my passion for the arts into a broader framework. As I delved deeper into the course, I began to notice parallels between theatre and events management. In theatre, I was trained to be adept at improvisation so as to respond to unexpected situations that can occur during a performance. This ability to think on my feet and be resourceful proved useful when I was learning how to plan large-scale events — particularly, for example, in moments where clients would spring last-minute requests on us, expecting us to deliver. Upon entering the world of Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions (MICE), it became clear to me that MICE, like theatre, takes an entire village to pull off. From those who set the vision for the event, to the marketing teams that spread the word to the right people, and the tech experts who enable everything to run smoothly, every role is crucial. There are times when things can get hectic, especially when I have to manage multiple events simultaneously, but the feeling of pride and accomplishment I get when the event wraps up successfully makes it all worthwhile. It reminds me of the long hours I used to spend at theatre rehearsals, culminating in enthusiastic applause from audiences. It soon became clear to me that when you are doing something you love, you are more than willing to put in the hours to ensure everything turns out perfect. While applause from a crowd is rarely in the cards for coordinators, the satisfaction of seeing an event come together is akin to receiving a standing ovation on opening night. While highly fulfilling, the job is not without its challenges. After more than seven years in the industry, I have encountered my fair share of roadblocks and obstacles, many of which I am grateful for as they have made me step out of my comfort zone. The recent pandemic for one, provided my team and I the chance to pivot and adapt to the changing nature of conferences. For a client’s new product launch, we learnt how to organise our first hybrid event with an international audience. Due to Covid restrictions, we could only have about 120 people attend the physical event here in Singapore, while another 200 attended virtually from Shenzhen, China. Figuring out how to keep guests engaged while abiding by safe distancing protocols was a challenge, but our hard work paid off: Our clients were very pleased with the turnout, and our delegates were also very impressed by how smoothly the event went. Another aspect of my job I really appreciate is being able to cross paths with professionals from all walks of life, from logistics experts and hospitality professionals to tech specialists and artists. Through my work, I have met people from all over the world — Canada, Austria, Japan and more. This has provided me valuable learning opportunities and expanded my perspectives. One of the most impactful memories of my MICE career was at a pharmaceutical conference I helped organise here in Singapore. Witnessing some of the world’s brightest minds come together to share about their game-changing innovations, each of which had the potential to save countless lives, I was struck by the realisation that this was only possible because of the work my team and I had poured into the event. This was just one of many moments that motivate me to keep making a meaningful difference through my work. No two events are the same, much like no two theatre performances are the same. Each event, like each stage performance, has its own unique story, challenges and triumphs. Finding a career that is enjoyable and fulfilling isn’t easy, but I’ve learnt that unexpected fields can offer the best of both worlds. Whatever journey you choose, the friendships forged along the way also make it a lot more meaningful – some of the people I crossed paths with during my theatre days remain some of my closest friends today. If I could somehow send a message to my younger self who was torn between my dreams and reality, I’d say this: Life has a way of surprising you. Keep an open mind, embrace every opportunity, and you might find a path that not only aligns with your passion, but also offers a world of experiences you never imagined.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks As young adults, we may dismiss some lines of work as 'less than' — but I've learnt that the key is to find a role that allows you to play to your strengths, and let that be your pathway to true fulfilment. While many of her peers tend to move from job to job, being able to help people keeps Gina Toh passionate about being a customer service officer. When I landed my first official job as a content producer, I was over the moon. After all, it gave me the chance to be part of the exciting media scene. Or so I thought. Having worked as a waitress and a cashier after ‘O’ Levels – jobs in which I had enjoyed daily interactions with many people — I quickly realised that life as a producer can be quite solitary. I also came to feel that my main concern was not the story I was working on, but rather how quickly I could churn out the work, and the number of viewers the story could garner. After close to five months of battling an overwhelming sense of isolation and self-doubt, I pivoted to a customer service job at OCBC at the age of 21. My friends who I had gone to school with were mystified. We had all worked hard to earn our media diplomas. They knew the pains that can come with long hours in service work, which also requires one to tolerate and manage angry and impatient customers at times. Customer service, to them, wasn’t just a pivot — it was a step down. But I knew the impact that good customer service could create. I still recall times when my parents were elated after bank staff helped them resolve their passbook issues. Even in a matter as small as this, helpful customer service officers were able to turn their day around. And so, even as my friends expressed scepticism, my parents wholly supported the move. They understood that I am a ‘people person’ at heart — being able to connect with others is my strength, and having opportunities to do this would be the best way for me to feel fulfilled in any job. This is why I have stayed in customer service for eight years, with no intention of leaving. You’re probably wondering: Isn’t it tiring to have to face unreasonable customers day after day? Based on my experience, the fact is: Yes, you will face at least one such customer every day. It’s true, these encounters are no fun — but what I have realised over the years is that even the unhappiest of customers is not unhappy with you. Rather, they are not pleased with what they have experienced. Often, what an angry customer wants most is just to be heard, and to have someone understand their plight. As a customer service officer, you have a chance to turn things around for them. They respond to you if you are patient and compassionate. No lie — sometimes customers can fly into a fit of rage and even shout at you. But that makes me even more determined to try to find a solution. You never know what someone is facing and how you make a difference. Recently, an elderly lady walked in. My colleagues and I could tell right away she was troubled. After speaking with her, I learnt that her husband had died several months ago of a heart attack, leaving behind debt of which she had been unaware. Late fees piled up surrounding an instalment plan for an insurance policy. Because the bill had gone unpaid, the amount owed had ballooned to around S$10,000. As she talked about her late husband, tears began to fall from her eyes, and my heart went out to her. I could not help but think of my grandmother, who experienced similar feelings of loss and grief when my grandfather passed on a decade ago. I was determined to help this customer. Working with various colleagues in different business units, we managed to get approval to expedite a waiver for her, significantly whittling down the amount she owed. We also worked to review the insurance policy with her, a process that revealed to her where a payout was rightfully owed to her. But most importantly, she found someone who was willing to listen — someone with whom she could share her precious memories of her late husband. I look back on her case with fondness and pride. Even now, it’s a reminder to my colleagues and myself that we can go above and beyond what we think we are capable of. While many of my peers tend to move from job to job, never staying more than a few years in a role, cases like these keep me passionate about the service line because they enable me to see how my actions have a tangible impact. Yes, I have to work retail hours, on weekends and on-site — requirements that are not especially popular with those in my generation. For this reason, among others, many industries find it difficult to hire and retain customer service staff. However, the good experiences definitely tide me through tough times. Little things warm my heart, like customers dropping into the branch just to say “Hello Gina”. Although we are not ‘friends’, we have a bond nonetheless. I get the sense that my customers know they can rely upon a personal connection in transactions that can otherwise feel impersonal, especially in an increasingly digital world. Although it is not the most glamorous job, for me, there is much personal achievement and fulfilment to be found in a role focused on helping people. My friends and family frequently remark on how I am thriving in this line. My loved ones have learned not to be quick to judge my career choices, but rather to prioritise my happiness. Contrary to popular belief, there is also career progression in this line. At the bank where I work, I have seen many colleagues transition to different service roles, keeping things fresh and exciting for them. To my fellow young adults who are looking to kickstart or reinvigorate their careers, do not dismiss customer service as an option — or, indeed, any other lines of work that we may often overlook as ‘less than’. The key is to find a role that allows you to play to your strengths, and let that be your pathway to true fulfilment.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Despite the double standards and stigma that remain prevalent for single mothers like me, the flexibility and financial stability of my job has empowered me to secure a steady livelihood for my children. Despite her initial scepticism, Juliana Jorimi quickly found a sense of empowerment working as a delivery driver to provide for her kids. Being a mother is a balancing act — but for a single mother, that challenge gets multiplied by a few hundred times. When my role as a homemaker ended upon separating from my ex-husband a few years back, I knew I had to step up and become the primary provider for my three children. As a mother, you'll do anything for your kids. I considered various options, like taking a full-time desk job, but I knew it would be tough to balance such work and my children. That’s why, armed with a driver’s licence and a knack for driving, I decided to take up delivery as a job. I found a position at a delivery firm, but that unfortunately folded towards the end of 2021. The abrupt closure left me jobless once again, frustrated about how I would now provide for my kids. In my time of turmoil, a close friend suggested that I try out Lalamove. I was initially sceptical, but upon learning about the company’s offer of lower car rental rates, 25 per cent fuel discounts and weekly pay-outs, I decided to jump on it. At that point, what did I have to lose? It also made sense to work in a job that kept me behind the wheel while giving me some flexibility. I rented a car and went through the onboarding and training, which was all done online and was much easier to follow than I’d expected. After two days, I was ready to hit the roads as a Lalamove driver-partner. I told myself: “Let’s just try it for a month.” After just three weeks, I realised the job’s potential to secure my family's financial needs — and I haven't looked back since. Of my three children, I take care of two under my custody while continuing to provide maintenance for my first. My younger ones — a lively six-year-old son and an adorable three-year-old daughter — fill my life with immense joy and playfulness. While my job offers plenty of flexibility, I still follow a well-kept routine by starting work at 9.30am or 10am after finishing my morning errands, which include sending my kids to kindergarten and childcare. I buy food from hawker centres and usually have lunch in the vehicle while searching and waiting for my next customer. Because I work six days a week, I cherish every moment with my children and prioritise the rest of my time for them. Be it a trip to the playground or cosy movie nights at home, the quality time we have together is extremely precious to me. In 2018, my son was diagnosed with a flesh-eating bacteria known as Group A streptococcus. What started as a mark as small as a mosquito bite turned into a lifelong health commitment. My son’s health crisis involved weeks in the hospital, some of which were spent in the intensive care unit. This year, he went through a below-knee amputation, learning to walk with his new prosthetic leg while undergoing regular physiotherapy. My child’s welfare became my top priority during this time, and I was determined to find a way to balance work and care for him. I started bringing him along on my deliveries when needed, ensuring he was occupied with books and toys. Interestingly, customers at pickup points almost never questioned his presence. Instead, they would often engage with him, making us feel welcomed and supported. There were days when my son was in pain and I couldn't fulfil a full seven-hour shift, but the relief of being able to be there for him while at work was priceless. Being able to take days off and plan my schedule around deliveries is something I couldn't have achieved in other lines of work such as a nine-to-five. While driving is my passion, I genuinely do enjoy the delivery process as well. I'm all about getting things done, ticking off the boxes on checklists in my head, no matter if they are chores, errands or deliveries. The people I encounter on the job make it an enriching one as well. I have fond memories of frequenting a fruit stall, picking up durians and mangosteens for eager customers. The stall owners relished working with me, sharing cheerful banters, doing small talk, and asking about my well-being as they entrusted me with their deliveries. I find that there is something profoundly heartwarming about the act of bringing people the things they need, right to their doorstep. I'm not just delivering packages; I'm delivering sustenance for Singaporeans, one package at a time. Of course, there are challenging days in my delivery journey where frustration takes hold — but even these are valuable moments that have significantly enhanced my sense of empathy. We are all humans, and we all have our rough days where we aren’t at our best. These experiences have taught me to extend patience and empathy to people I meet each day, even if I may only encounter them for a moment. Being a present mother remains extremely important to me. Having lost my own mother a few years ago, I vowed to be there for my children in their times of need. I want them to feel secure and supported as they navigate the whirlwind of life and grow into their own persons. In this, the little things are so important: For example, I deeply cherish the moments when I can step into my kitchen, don my apron, and whip up a home-cooked meal. Two or three times a week, I become both the delivery hero and the family chef. Despite the double standards and stigma that remain prevalent for single mothers like me, we find a way to reach a new level of resilience and strength every day. We embrace our roles as both providers and caregivers, serving as both father and mother to our children. We're in it for the long drive, fuelled by our children’s smiles to keep powering along. The flexibility and financial stability of driving with Lalamove has empowered me to secure a steady livelihood for my children. I count it not only a personal victory for me, but a testament to the incredible capabilities of single mothers everywhere. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Juliana Jorimi, 33, is a driver-partner at Lalamove.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks I was out shopping a few weeks ago when a mother of two approached me to tell me how she admired my courage for talking about dating. Samara Gan, artist and author of graphic novel How to Date a Dozen Men, on Nov 30, 2023. I was out shopping a few weeks ago when a mother of two approached me to tell me how she admired my courage for talking about dating. She had recognised me from the launch of my first graphic novel How to Date a Dozen Men at Kinokuniya. As she looked at me with hopeful eyes, I wondered if I should tell her my hidden truth – that I’m actually not brave at all, and that I still get cold feet when I think about reading new reviews about my book. Instead, I replied jokingly about how if someone like me could write a book about dating, anyone could do it too. I knew art was my thing as I grew up, even before I knew how to make friends at the playground. If I wasn’t watching cartoons like Teen Titans or Winx Club as a kid, I was making things out of papier mache and glue like that guy on the children’s TV series Art Attack. I was also inspired by one of my best friends in primary school, who would draw comics about her original characters on cheap printer paper and staple them together to create issues. She would then give them to me. Encouraged by her efforts, I tried making my own comics too. Yet, I couldn’t help comparing my rough scribblings with the smooth curves that my best friend drew. This might be when the imposter syndrome began creeping into my life. I remember being so fixated on “fixing” my artwork that I never managed to complete a whole issue. Eventually, I stopped drawing as I got busier in secondary school, but I was still attracted to the world of comics. There was something empowering about how the heroines in DC Comics always knew and did what was right, and so I started collecting comic books and little figurines of them. At the time, I also heard about the Singapore Comic Con, which is one of the leading events here for comic lovers like me. I knew this was something I absolutely had to attend. I remember my heart pounding in my chest when I met so many talented and passionate artists and cosplayers. It felt like the most magical place on Earth – even better than Disneyland. That motivated me to get my creative juices going again. Because my best friend had a drawing tablet, I immediately begged her to teach me how to use it over the school holidays. I got hooked the moment I made my first brush stroke in years. Eventually, I bought my own drawing tablet and I would draw almost every day. To sharpen my skills, I’d borrow books from the library and watch art tutorials on YouTube. Despite this, I was allergic to any praise that came my way. When some of my friends said that I was talented, I’d immediately brush aside their compliments and insist that anyone could do it with sheer discipline, determination, and lots of free time. I didn’t feel like I deserved compliments for something I felt I didn’t have or earn. While completing my communications degree, I did everything I could to essentially learn about comics without actually majoring in it. I took classes about graphic novels, did an independent study on feminism in comic books, and even wrote a final year thesis about superhero comics. During a semester abroad, I jumped at the chance to visit Wondercon in the US, excited to experience an American version of the Singapore Comic Con. There, I met so many writers and artists, and by some stroke of luck, I was invited to the DC Comics headquarters in Burbank California. I was surrounded by my heroes – people who made my childhood and youth full of colour and life. I thought they were like celebrities who were far out of my reach, but meeting them made me realise that they were just regular people who somehow had shared the same passion with me. For the first time, it felt like it was possible to actually be a comic book artist. Eventually, I began drawing and selling my own designs. I started with stickers, charms, prints, and even an annual calendar of my favourite DC Comics characters. Finally, in 2018, I gathered enough courage to set up my own booth at the Singapore Comic Con. Even then, I still felt insecure if my art was good enough to make a career out of it. I needed a platform to showcase my work to the world, and prove my insecurities wrong. The turning point came when I heard about the Work in Progress programme at the convention. This was an initiative to help aspiring artists get published, which felt like the perfect opportunity for aspiring artists like me to meet publishers and get feedback for my work. I first entered the contest in 2020. I survived on caffeine and Salonpas for three weeks while I slogged on my entry, only to miss the chance to meet the publishers because I was too busy preparing for my Comic Con booth. When the contest came back in 2021, I was busy working on my own projects and didn’t have time to work on a full submission. It was at this time that I hatched the idea to come up with an illustrated book about all the guys I’d met through the matchmaking service I’d signed up for. Truth be told, I picked this theme because it was the easiest thing I could think of, and I didn’t think that I would be successfully shortlisted for the Comic Con initiative. Somehow, my book became a finalist and the publisher Epigram decided to pick it up! After 18 months of struggling with the book and working through multiple identity crises as I dissected my own psyche, it was finally published. Even then, imposter syndrome struck me again because I remember being terrified of the reviews. My art style was simple, unlike the elaborate drawings with intricate details that I’ve seen in manga and western comics. Will people like my book? Will they think my art is too childish? Will they think I’m too picky, too confident, or too geeky to find a partner? What if one of the dates in the book recognised me? What if I was cancelled? Whenever a new review came up, I got my friends to read them first before I even dared to take a glance. So, when readers started telling me how much the book resonated with them, I was taken by surprise. The book turned out to be a bestseller at Kinokuniya in the comics category for two whole weeks. The Straits Times called it “a charmingly relatable dive into the woes of modern dating” and gave me a five-star review. What struck me most from this experience was the small interactions with readers. For example, I once received a heartwarming note from a reader that said “You are deserving of love too”. I realised that this is why I make art, and it is to connect with people. That is why I still continue to participate in art events where I get to meet people, because it constantly reminds me that I’m part of something which can inspire others to keep chasing their dreams. As such, I’m an exhibitor at the Singapore Comic Con this year once more. But when I heard that the phrase “Make It Here” was the theme for this year’s Singapore Media Festival, which the Comic Con is a part of, I couldn’t help feeling that same niggling feelings of self-doubt. I wondered: Could I even say if I’d “made it” yet? Over the years, I still have yet to completely put aside my imposter syndrome, which I have accepted will always loom over me. When I look back at my old art, for example, I still cringe at my feeble attempts at drawing human anatomy. But I have since learnt to take such feelings in my stride by being proud of what I’ve achieved. I still wonder if being an artist is truly my calling, but I always think back to a moment in 2022 when I met one of my favourite comic artists Mitch Gerads at the Singapore Comic Con a few years ago while donning the costume of the iconic Wonder Woman. He is an acclaimed illustrator for DC Comics, and I had purchased a piece of art from him that showed a girl looking at a framed picture of Wonder Woman while emulating her power pose. Serendipitously, a little girl came up to me for a photo, eyes sparkling and also pulling off the power pose. This wasn’t just life imitating art, but it was his artwork actually coming to life in this chance encounter. I knew from then on that I wanted to create special moments like this too through my art. Because as long as I continue creating meaningful art for people and sharing them, I think I’m going to be okay.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks A good dog never growls at its owners. A good marriage means few arguments. A good business is one that is profitable and growing. Jeremy Oh, director of OHBOY! Pictures, on Dec 1, 2023. A good dog never growls at its owners. A good marriage means few arguments. A good business is one that is profitable and growing. These seemed like wise adages, or so I once thought. On one particular Monday in September, I went into the office, sat each of my employees down one-by-one, and told them that I was letting them go — not due to any fault of theirs, or because of the company’s finances. It was hard to explain, but I needed to upend the life that I had been constructing for the past decade, even if – by most metrics – it was doing fine. I was fortunate enough to have a comfortable childhood, and parents who were supportive of all my pursuits. Throughout my growing years, they nurtured me the best way they knew how, by building up my confidence, telling me they were proud of me, and proclaiming me to be a natural leader. Perhaps that was what gave me the foolhardiness to plunge into starting up a new video production business after graduating from university in 2012. I had studied video production, and I had no doubt that I could make a living from the skills I had at the time. Moreover, my mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and this was the best way to maximise the time I spent with her. In 2013, my then girlfriend joined me, and over the next decade, we slowly expanded the company to a peak of 15. Together with our team, we worked on over 400 projects for 120 clients to create corporate videos and other short-form content. We had a solid stable of clients, which enabled us to ride the waves of different challenges, including Covid-19. In the eyes of many people, we were a company that was doing fine. Just like how the pandemic was a time for many to reflect deeply on their lives, it was the same for us as well. As we took a pause and relooked at what we were doing, it soon became apparent that our “good” business was perhaps not so good for us. Running a new company is easy, insofar as the goals are straightforward — get more portfolio, clients and staff members. Rinse and repeat. It’s hectic, and the breakneck pace means that you never stop and reflect on what you’re doing. But when a company matures, you cannot keep doing the same. The world around you is always changing. The conditions that make you profitable today won’t exist tomorrow. The challenges you face may not be part of a cycle, but a permanent, structural change. Being in the creative space, our strongest asset will always be people and if I wanted to grow the company, or even just survive, I needed to invest time and energy into management, culture, and establishing a deeper vision for the business. But these were not areas that I was good at, and having never worked for someone else before, I had no reference point. Plus, I had been told that I was not a natural business leader. Perhaps the idea of such a leader does not exist at all, but the reality was that I did not want to commit to doing what was needed to take my company further. What I enjoyed about my work at the production house is getting to listen to the stories of people from all walks of life, and having intimate access to the inner workings of various organisations that I work with. To me, my fulfilment did not come from running a business in itself. If I were to commit to the task of growing the company, then I would just be shackling myself to the job, and missing the point of being my own boss. That was back in 2020. It took me close to three years to take the next steps, which was letting go of all my employees (except my wife, of course) and moving into a tiny office space, turning back the clock on a decade of work. Perhaps I could have made the change faster if I had some deep creative hunger to fulfil. Truth is, we were ok. I wasn’t exceptionally unhappy. Our revenues were not a disaster. The bigger problem was that I had tied my identity to being a business owner, and I was afraid to let go of that. I couldn’t envision what an alternate life would look like, and so I kept putting off what needed to be done. But then I looked around myself and realised that many things that I hold to be self-evident truths are simply false once I thought harder about them. A good dog never growls at its owners? Our adopted Singapore Special frequently growls at us, simply because he didn’t grow up learning any other way to communicate, but he’s not aggressive by any measure. A good marriage means few arguments? My wife and I argue all the time, but working through disagreements helps us understand each other better. A marriage with no arguments is worse if both sides are hiding their feelings to avoid conflict. If I could see that these truisms were not what they appeared to be, then why am I hung up on the idea that a good business is simply one that is profitable and growing? Why could I not recognise that it is possible to have a profitable company, and also that I needed to give it up? What finally helped me to make the decision was realising that running the business was sapping my emotional energy, which is much harder to regain than physical energy. My wife and I had no hobbies, our social circles were shrinking, and even finding the energy to watch a new television show often felt like a daunting prospect. Ironically, even though we worked together, we never felt like we had enough time for each other because we were always in business mode. A year after I started the business, my mother passed away. Throughout her illness, I saw how having money enabled us to maximise her treatment options and keep her comfortable. That was the lesson I took away then, but a decade later, I realise that the more important lesson is to not waste time living a life that is just okay. My mother died at just 56 years old; any of us could go tomorrow. If we have the privilege to do so, we owe it to ourselves to thrive, and not just survive. There are so many more places to go, people to meet and things to try. Maybe I could shine in a different industry. Maybe I might do better as an employee than as a boss. Maybe I might produce the best work of my life working with my wife. Maybe I was wrong about it all, and will start hiring people again. The exploration, and not the conclusion, is the main point. As we approach 2024, I will continue to have doubts about my course of action, but my decision has unshackled my creative energies and given me the drive to do my best for projects that I feel passionate for. I am also energised at the opportunity to work even more closely with my work and life partner, and I am thankful for the clients who continue to have faith in us and our ability to produce quality videos, even as we evolve as a company. Most of all, I am no longer at the crossroads, and am excited to be back at the trailhead, knowing that I have the power to redefine my journey along the way. There is value in running companies that eschew the pursuit of growth, in favour of building a path that is mentally and emotionally sustainable. There is value in living a life where “luxury” comes from the peace of mind in knowing that you have crafted your life consciously and deliberately, even if it doesn’t turn out as planned. Most of all, there is value in searching for a way to thrive, and not just do ok. It’s safe in the boat, but if it isn’t sailing where you want to go, then you might be better off jumping into the water and swimming.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Of all the subjects we’d learnt in school, at least one should have explained how hard making and maintaining friendships would be in adulthood. Is making and keeping friends simply impossible in Singapore? We met at a book launch event. Over dinner, we had a funny conversation about how cool Swedish people were. We joked about how we too wished we could start something like Spotify, or even Ikea. I asked her if we could keep in contact. She hesitated. “I have a boyfriend.” Seriously? That escalated quickly; the mere suggestion of keeping in touch had somehow leapt into being interpreted as a romantic invitation. I confess: I, a born and raised Singaporean, don’t quite understand how to make and keep friends in Singapore. In my 20s, of all the problems I would face, I’d never expected loneliness to be one of the biggest ones. Of all the subjects we’d learnt in school, at least one should have explained how hard making and maintaining friendships would be in adulthood. I’d always dismissed it as a problem for older people. After all, a lifetime of sitcoms had taught us that being in your 20s is all about being mobile, sociable, and entirely able to make friends. But week after week, I found myself staring down the barrel of an empty Sunday afternoon and wondering how I got there. Don’t get me wrong — I’m not uncomfortable being alone. I make it a point to date myself once a week, taking time to watch a movie alone or have a good meal on my own. But at some point, I realised a need to feel emotionally connected with others. As former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy wrote in his book Together, loneliness is “the absence of physical and emotional connection”. I longed for and craved that emotional connection. In their adulthood, people commonly return to the friendships formed when they were younger, such as secondary school or university friends. In most of these friend groups, I took on the role of initiator by default. But slowly, I got tired of coordinating times, and of figuring out where to go and what to do. “Sorry, I’m busy” became one of my most hated phrases, especially when there were no attempts to suggest alternative timings. I was putting in the effort, but I wasn’t seeing the same from my friends. It felt like I was being taken for granted. Some others would not commit until extremely late, perhaps three days before the meeting date. People who often do this can make you feel as if you are simply one social option out of many, and they are more concerned with gauging which one would be the most beneficial to them. I don’t blame them. For most working young adults, our jobs already take up so much time and energy — of course one would want to make the most of any free time, with the right people. So I went on a mission to make new friends. It started with attending social events like book clubs and mixers. Whenever I had a decent conversation with a new acquaintance, I would ask if I could keep in touch. Most of them were willing to keep in touch via Telegram handles. But then any text conversation would usually die, as there was no real reason to continue chatting outside of the event we had met at. Some would also ‘ghost’ me or not reply altogether. None of them explicitly told me this — but I have a sneaking suspicion they’d assumed I was trying to either sell them something or date them. Singaporeans are a pragmatic people, much to both our benefit and our detriment. Here, new connections are often approached in a transactional manner. The receiving party’s default frame of mind seems to be: “What does this person want from me?” For us, connections often aren’t relational — rarely are they the point in itself. Conversations become about networking, instead of just sharing a good laugh, a funny story, and good company. Whenever we’re approached by a stranger, it’s hard for us to imagine that they have no agenda beyond just friendship. Is making and keeping friends simply impossible in Singapore? May, 2022: While passing through my neighbourhood, I heard shouts and the familiar thwack of a ball against a wall. I followed the sounds to the soccer court, where a handful of youths were playing. Embarrassed, I asked if I could join them. It was awkward, and I was aware: Here I was, a 26-year-old man, attempting to join a group of 13- to 16-year-olds. Much to my relief, these boys kindly and gladly welcomed me. Over the past 18 months, we’ve become more than just players sharing a court. They share their troubles in school with me. I share my troubles about work and dating with them. Just like that, in the most unexpected of places, I found — dare I say it — friends. What makes upkeep of this connection easy is that there are no elaborate efforts to try and find common timeslots. You just appear, and play. Now, when I meet someone new and ask to exchange contact info, I quickly add: “I’m not trying to date you.” This clarity appears to help. (I’ve not been rejected yet, at least.) But perhaps the most important of my takeaways is to be intentional with friends, both old and new. To keep in touch with people, we first need to know who we want to keep in touch with. One exercise I found helpful was the making of a friendship map — something I lifted from We Need To Hang Out by Billy Baker. For this, Baker uses Dunbar’s Number — anthropologist Robin Dunbar’s theory that 150 is the typical number of people we can keep track of and consider part of our ongoing social network at any one time. What’s more interesting are the numbers in between: Dunbar estimates that we would have about five close friends, 15 we would consider family, 50 we would see as part of our clan, and the remaining 80 as part of our tribe. Baker also relies on the internal question: “Would you want to ask this person out for coffee if you randomly bumped into them?” If the answer is no, or “it’d be awkward”, it’s likely that they aren’t someone you would consider a friend. I like to think friendships are like clothes. Different clothes are good for different seasons. You can’t change the season to fit the clothes you wear. Instead, it’s more ideal that you wear clothes that fit the season. There are the tough seasons, where all you want each weekend is friends to have fun with so you can forget about work or whatever struggles you’re facing during the week. Then there are the seasons where you have a little more time. During these periods, actively nurturing my friendships, rather than leaving them to chance, reminds me of what makes life meaningful. But, regardless of weather, clothes can and will spoil. When that happens, you need to decide whether those friendships are still fit for purpose. Often, though, such friendships can be worth a mend. Try something new with your friend — play a sport unfamiliar to you both, explore a new country, or embark on a new adventure together. The important thing is to do something. Take action. Chances are, if you are thinking of a friend, they’re probably also thinking of you. It’s not just because your friends are worth it. It’s because you, too, are worth hanging out with.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks My third pregnancy was not as smooth as my first two. My third pregnancy was not as smooth as my first two. At 28 weeks, we received news that Sonia had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Something was obstructing the nourishment she was meant to receive and could potentially obstruct blood flow to her brain. Her birth was also likely to be induced prematurely. But my doctor’s hope was that she would make it to full term with mature lungs. She wanted to do a C-section to get Sonia out once she hit the 37-week mark. The rest of the pregnancy from there on was wrought with tension. I had to monitor Sonia’s movements throughout the day to make sure she was still alive. We had to look for a nanny to prepare for a C-section. At the same time, we also had two other young children to care for. Along the way, a few more scares were added to the mix. Sonia’s weight dropped from the 10th percentile to the fifth; her blood flow was decreasing; and at the 32-week mark I was put on bed rest after false labour. I had to start medications to slow down contractions, lower my blood pressure, and delay labour. I took four steroid shots over the next three days to prepare Sonia’s lung’s for premature birth. Suffice to say, our plate was very full. Everything around us was messy and uncertain, and we had no assurance of any particular outcome. Still, we didn’t feel overwhelmed with worry or fear about Sonia. Our faith told us God was very in control of all the moving parts; whatever the outcome, we would make it through. Two weeks later, we got the miraculous update that Sonia was no longer a critical case: her growth percentile was up, and blood flow to her brain was fine. Things seemed back on track. On May 21, 2021, Sonia was born, weighing in at 2kg. Other than hypothyroidism, a condition commonly related to IUGR, she was given a clean bill of health. For the first seven months of her life, she gained weight steadily. Then for the next one and a half years, she would barely gain a kilogram. Her paediatrician, who specialises in newborns with low birth weights, was puzzled, especially given she was not my first child and I would know what normal food intake was like, something I reported dutifully. When Sonia missed several of her milestones, we put it down to her being on the smaller side of the curve. Still, after a while, something seemed amiss, and the doctor began referring us to genetics doctors and nutritionists. Calories, vitamin supplements, and special formula milk were added to her diet. No change. All this was so new to me. Never before had I had to care so much about how much protein and calories my kids were eating. I just fed them “healthy” food and both had simply hit their milestones as per. We decided to take the genetics blood test that was offered — even though it cost a fortune and there was only a 30 per cent chance of discovering anything at all. It was hard to put Sonia through it all. At barely two years old, her hypothyroidism meant she already needed to get her blood drawn every two months. And, being so small, they would never get her veins on the first attempt. Or second. Or third. It always took about 45 minutes — pricking, holding her down and then pumping the blood out drop by drop. And nothing made my girl more upset than being held down. This time was no different; I held her down while they drew three vials of blood, triple what her other test needed. The results would come two months later. We opted to take the results via a call, after a failed attempt to drive through insane pre-holiday traffic, since we were not really expecting to receive any serious news. The clinic called, and my husband was the only one free to take it then; mothering duties meant I would only get an update after the fact. We learned that night that Sonia has a very new and very rare condition called Rauch Steindl Syndrome. There are only 28 other known cases in the world. It is caused by the malfunctioning of the gene responsible for growth. Regardless of what she eats, she doesn’t really grow. It causes hypotonia (low muscle mass), making her far weaker than her peers. There would be ensuing developmental delays. The oldest known person with the condition is still alive at 58 years old and, as far as research has shown, the condition is not inherited. Listed as one of the symptoms is IUGR. After my husband shared the news with me, we sat silently together for what felt like a long time, not quite knowing what to make of things. The randomness of it all. Sonia was the child we never quite intended to have — yet, in that moment, we also deeply understood that there was such providence in her being part of our family, rare condition and all. Sonia means “wisdom”, and she is truly a product of a greater wisdom I am only beginning to discover. Her life and all that she is, feels so specific, so unique, so precise. Sonia’s life has been a cycle of unveiling and understanding. And, given how little the world knows of her condition, we are forging where few have tread before. But the one thing I do know is that rather than fear of what is to come, I simply feel deeply honoured to be part of her journey and I trust that my good God who lovingly knit her in my womb will see her — and us — through beyond each bend.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Finding joy in motherhood seems to come naturally and easily to most new mothers. Yet, my own experience revolved mainly around grappling with the demands of parenting and steadily losing my grip on sanity. For Paige Lee, finding ways to cheer and motivate herself on difficult days can be hard — but being able to do the same for others going through tough times of their own through her art is a powerful source of encouragement for her. Finding joy in motherhood seems to come naturally and easily to most new mothers. Yet, my own experience revolved mainly around grappling with the demands of parenting, thoughts of my life solely centering on my newborn, and steadily losing my grip on sanity. I became a first-time mother in 2017, and suffered from postnatal depression. My focus then was just to get through each day. Even though my family was supportive, I still felt overwhelmed and struggled ceaselessly with anxiety and guilt. This was not the first time I’ve experienced an episode of poor mental health, and I knew I had to do something. In my early years as a school teacher, I had faced burnout and exhibited signs of depression. I withdrew from social interactions and lost joy in my day-to-day activities. Despite reaching out to professionals for help, I couldn't seem to find a way out. It was through sheer determination and the support of family and friends that I eventually pulled through that dark period. With no prior drawing or illustration background, I started doodling during pockets of free time between motherhood duties — a hobby I embarked on in an attempt to keep my intrusive thoughts at bay. I approached my art journey with an open mind, believing that consistent practice leads to progress. While I lacked formal training, I drew inspiration from other accomplished illustrators on social media who began their careers without prior experience. Their success stories motivated me to invest time and effort into honing my craft. The time spent on art diverted my attention from overthinking, and I also became more mindful of my own thoughts as I learnt to slow them down. Art quickly became my most valuable therapeutic outlet, providing solace and aiding my emotional well-being. On difficult days, it helped me to look back on the progress I've made on my mental health journey, reminding me of my own resilience. I soon started an Instagram page (@a.kinderspace) as a way to document my own artworks — but I soon found many opportunities to connect with other individuals responding to my struggles, and even sharing their own personal hardships. I wound up creating a safe space for sharing relatable mum struggles. Most of my inspiration comes from people around me, inadvertently providing solace and encouragement during challenging times. Sometimes it’s as simple as a quote that I stumble upon online or in a book, or a positive memory from my own life. Finding ways to cheer and motivate myself on difficult days can be hard sometimes — but the possibility of my illustrations being able to do the same for others going through tough times of their own is a powerful source of comfort and encouragement. My art journey began as a search for distraction from my thoughts. Funnily enough, it has not only made me more mindful in my thoughts, but has also become a tool to advocate mental wellness — prioritising self-love and normalising speaking up about needing help. The magic lies in being intentional with what we feed our minds, and acknowledging that life has its ups and downs. Even now, I am thankful that my illustrations serve a purpose, be it raising awareness about mental health issues or comforting and encouraging someone else in the same mental space as me. Our lives are a never-ending race against time. The demands of work, family and personal responsibilities can create a whirlwind of pressure, leaving us grappling with the weight of expectations and the perpetual quest for balance. Amid the whirlwind of daily tasks and life's challenges, it's easy to lose sight of our mental well-being. Creativity has become an integral part of my life, providing a channel for self-expression and connection with others. My first solo exhibition “Hi K, I’ve Got This: Drawing Perseverance” opened on Nov 2, 2023. My display, made possible by the Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre, offers a visual narrative for the silent battles we fight and the struggles we all endure each day. The featured illustrations centre on a “bungirl” character named K, short for ‘okay’. Through her adventures, K embodies strength, resilience, and the courage to face difficulties head-on. Each illustration is a reminder that, despite the chaos, we possess an inner strength capable of weathering life’s storms. My work has always been about embracing imperfections, self-compassion, and dismantling the stigma surrounding mental health challenges. By fostering an open conversation about mental wellness, my art aims to create a space where we can find solace, connection, and inspiration amid life's challenges. For me, this exhibition is another step in my endeavour to encourage myself and others to acknowledge our struggles, and to seek support when we need it. These days, I’ve learned to better regulate my emotions, and to acknowledge that each day, whether positive or challenging, contributes to my personal growth. It’s okay not to be okay. Most importantly, know that no matter the circumstances, there’s always room for hope.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks “What do you mean, you don’t know?” I stared blankly at my boss, totally lost for words. For Nathanael Lim, spending two years struggling at a difficult job taught him that our failures don’t have to define us. This audio is AI-generated. “What do you mean, you don’t know?” I stared blankly at my boss, totally lost for words. The footnote he was questioning me about stared back at me from the very bottom of a dense document — to some, a small oversight; to me, an indelible hallmark of my latest failure. In my defence, it was among hundreds of documents I was typically assigned to read each night — but this was not the first mistake I would make at this particular job, nor would it be the last. That particular meeting had been a breaking point of sorts. After it, I sat down at my desk and asked myself, for the very first time in my life: “Am I really that bad at what I do?” My father is a self-made man who had climbed the corporate ladder to become chief executive of an international company. He’d ingrained in me from a young age that I should aspire to be “a scholar in the classroom, an athlete on the field, and a master in the performance hall”. I was the typical “model student”, graduating with straight As from secondary school and junior college while holding leadership positions in multiple co-curricular activities — captain of the rugby team; vice-president of debate club; even head prefect. At university, I did a double degree in business and law, and took well to both disciplines. I graduated with first-class honours in both my degrees and emerged class valedictorian. After a short training period at a local law firm, I was invited to work for the Supreme Court, the highest judicial court in Singapore. Only the top 1 per cent of each law cohort receive such invitations, and as a 25-year-old at the start of his professional journey, I felt extremely honoured. I loved everything about the job. My bosses were kind, the work meaningful and fulfilling. I had amazing colleagues, many of whom I remain good friends with today. Up until that point, I’d never really had any significant setbacks in my life, aside from a few bumps and hitches. I naively assumed the next phase of my career would be just as smooth-sailing. After a few years, I wanted to delve deeper into the world of business. So I left the Supreme Court and joined a Magic Circle firm (the term bestowed on the five most prestigious multi-national law firms headquartered in London). Going into it, I knew that navigating the jump from public litigation to private corporate work would be difficult — but I saw it as just another challenge which I would successfully tackle. After all, that was what my entire life had set me up to expect, right? The reality could not have been further from my imagination. Each day in my new job was a struggle in a way I had never experienced before. I struggled to pick up a subject in which I’d had almost no prior exposure. While the firm had offered me a title appropriate for my years of practice and assigned me work accordingly, I struggled to keep up with peers and even juniors with more relevant experience. I struggled to adjust to a new culture and method of learning. In my previous job, I’d been guided by more experienced seniors; here, I was expected to learn everything by myself on the fly. I struggled to relate to my bosses, some of whom had different working styles and priorities than I was used to. Nearly two years and a litany of mistakes later, it was clear that I was not doing well in this job. Doubt overtook me — so much so that I went on an introspection exercise, calling up five ex-colleagues and close friends, and asking them to tell me what they thought my strengths and weaknesses were. Eventually, I had to admit defeat and leave the firm. I was jaded. Tired. Discouraged, and honestly, a little bit lost as to what had happened. Two months later, I joined another practice to pursue tech (something I’d always loved). I worked with startups, venture capital funds, and gaming companies. And, over time, I started to really enjoy what I do again. Some things that helped were a genuine interest in the subject matter, a better culture fit, and a more relatable boss — but here’s what really struck me upon starting anew. It took some time, but it soon dawned on me that I had learnt and grown so much during my years of painful, uncomfortable struggle. The countless nights spent trading sleep for work, the 7.30am meetings (that usually followed a 4am late night), the harsh and sometimes unnecessarily snide remarks. Somewhere in the midst of all that struggle, I’d picked up far more than I even realised. Every single mechanism, arrangement, process, and type of agreement — even as I’d been drowning, bit by bit, everything was getting retained in its own way. Everything I had learnt then helped me to prosper in the next phase of my career. By drowning a bit (or what felt like a lot), I had somehow learnt how to swim. Learning something new is always hard. Sometimes, it’s really hard. But that first intense period of struggle and discomfort is a necessary first hurdle to getting on track. Getting in shape? The first 2 km is the worst. Stamping out bad habits? The first two months are the hardest. Learning a new language? The first 10 lessons are the most uncomfortable. But if you keep your head down, and stick to it with perseverance and humility, everything will fall in place. Because failure can really suck — but it can be a great teacher. I left legal practice in 2022 to start my own tech company in the blockchain and video gaming space. The last two years have felt almost like a repeat of the two years I spent struggling and drowning in that Magic Circle firm. The patterns are strikingly similar: Jumping into a new discipline; taking on new tasks and responsibilities for the first time; always feeling like I can’t catch up with everyone else who has more experience. My co-founder and I also made our fair share of mistakes as we built the company from the ground up. Don’t get me wrong — I still hate failing. But I now see that failure is an essential part of learning. In my new role as a boss, I also find it much easier to empathise with others when mistakes are made. As we step into 2024, I find myself armed with a quiet confidence that the hard work, suffering and struggle will prepare me for whatever will come next. Our failures don’t have to define us — with the right attitude and perspective, they can become small but valuable footnotes in our stories, enriching the pages with lessons learned and wisdom earned.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks It started in 2015, with a cupcake tutorial that popped up on my YouTube explore page. Not a lot of people know this, but I’ve got a string of disastrous baking attempts on my record from when I was younger. Even now, I don’t really know what it was that made me want to try out that video. Former home baker Lee Su Fang, 27, says opening her own shop is the hardest thing she has ever done, but she does not regret her decision one bit. This audio is AI-generated. It started with a YouTube video. The year was 2015: During the long wait between junior college and university, I spent my afternoons coaching softball part-time, which meant that I had ample time to kill in the mornings. One morning, a cupcake tutorial by CupcakeJemma popped up on my explore page. Not a lot of people know this, but I’ve got a string of disastrous baking attempts on my record from when I was younger. Even now, I don’t really know what it was that made me want to try out that video — a need to scratch some creative itch? Boredom? A bit of both? Whatever it was, this particular batch of cupcakes came out great, much to my own surprise, and got positive feedback from family and friends. I immediately started trying out different flavours and variations, fascinated by the way the simple concept of a cupcake could produce countless end results. Within a few months, I was hooked. My baking output quickly outpaced the rate at which my family and friends were consuming my bakes. At that point, I plucked up the courage to create an Instagram page to sell my bakes, soon upgrading from cupcakes to simple cakes. Receiving orders was so exciting; each one was an opportunity to feed my growing interest in baking. Looking back on them, I now think those first bakes were horrible — but hey, we all start somewhere. All through university, I spent my weekdays in classes and my weekends baking orders. I appreciated the small side income my “hobby” provided me but, to be perfectly honest, I didn’t have any concrete idea of what I wanted to do with it. Doubt loomed in my mind: “Am I good enough to pursue this as a career? Where can this business go? If I commit to this, what will the next few years look like?” Upon graduation in July 2019, I told my mum and dad that I wanted to take a stab at turning my home-based side hustle into a full-time job. It took my practical-minded parents some convincing, and I had to make some concessions: I promised them that, should the business not work out after a year, I would pack up my spatulas and find a “regular” corporate job instead. Confession: I wasn’t sure I was making the right decision at the time. For all my attempts at allaying my parents’ doubts, my own lingered — but all I knew was that I needed to give my passion for baking a fair shot. For the next six months, I poured countless hours into recipe development and took on as many orders as I could to grow the business. Frosted by Fang was a one-woman show, and I had to very quickly learn to wear multiple hats at once: Logistics manager, social media marketer, business administrator and customer service officer, all while furthering my own baking self-education. Then Covid-19 hit. The world came to a standstill — but my business got a sudden boost. In the midst of lockdowns and minimised socialisation, sending care packages became the new norm, and my mixed dessert boxes, which now included brownies, cookies, tarts and more, quickly became a hit. Coming out of the pandemic, I did my very first pop-up at Baker X in mid-2022. It was the first time that I could interact with customers in person, a human element I had been missing as a home-based business. A couple for whom I’d done an order of gender reveal cupcakes in 2019 dropped by with their little one in tow — and it struck me hard how gratifying it was to be, through my bakes, a part of people’s lives and cherished milestones. By then, I’d managed to save up enough to enrol in a two-month pastry course in Bordeaux, France — my first brush with formal baking instruction after years of being entirely self-taught. Being able to work in a larger kitchen with industrial equipment sparked a new dream in me: Could I one day have my own space to bake in? The spark became a flame when I returned to Singapore and realised that my business demands had outgrown the production capacity my home kitchen could offer. Despite the success I’d seen up till then, Doubt’s nagging voice lingered in my head. Setting up any kind of physical store would be an uphill task unlike anything I’d faced before, comprising mounds of paperwork, logistical dilemmas and nightmares, and endless planning. But I knew the only way to overcome my reservations was to just bite the bullet. After a long and rocky location scouting process, I finally found my dream spot in Joo Seng Green, but the space itself was not fit to run a food-and-beverage business in — which meant many more months spent getting approvals for licensing, appropriate alterations and fittings, and so on. With a lot of help from my family, friends and partner, the shop slowly but surely started to take shape. In August 2023, I officially opened its doors for business. My little shop is the hardest thing I have ever done, and it’s still early days, but I have not regretted my decision one bit. With the addition of a physical location, the number of hats I wear has practically doubled. It’s overwhelming at times, but I have never felt more fulfilled. The learning curves along the way were even steeper than I’d anticipated, but I never would have gotten anywhere without them. Every mistake allowed me to better the business and myself. My mother also came onboard as my first (and only) full-time employee, handling front-of-house service in the store. As we grow older, work typically takes us further away from our parents — but I’m grateful for all the time being in the store has allowed my mum and I to spend together and how much closer we’ve gotten because of it. My store also gives me the chance to get to know the residential community and even make friends with many of my newfound regulars. Frosted by Fang would not be where it is today without their generous love and support. Sometimes I do think it would be nice to have some of the things a “regular” corporate job affords my peers — paid time off, medical coverage, weekends free to spend with loved ones, among others — but ultimately, these are sacrifices worth making in pursuit of my passion for baking. Where will my little “hobby” take me next? I don’t know for sure — but I’ve learnt to accept that my old friend Doubt will still be a visitor from time to time, dropping in and making his uncomfortable presence felt. Rushing to dismiss him in hopes that he will disappear doesn’t work, though. Rather, I’ve learnt to sit with him for a while and the questions his presence brings, so I can focus on assessing what is within my control and what isn’t. More than that, I’ve learnt not to let Doubt stop me from taking action. The more I do and the more knowledge and experience I gather, the more I can build up my own courage and, eventually, my visitor will naturally take his leave. It’s okay to be afraid; what matters is you do it anyway. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Lee Su Fang, 27, is the founder of Frosted by Fang.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks I always thought that doing well in school meant making my parents happy. As such, exam periods were very stressful, and I would often burn the midnight oil revising. This work ethic carried on into my professional life when I became a working adult. Tan Wan Ting, the 33-year-old founder of digital marketing agency Weave Asia, says she made it a point to balance her team's workload to prevent them from overworking like she used to. This audio is AI-generated. Growing up, my parents were loving but demanding. My father was a private tutor who had quit his full-time job in the optical industry so that he would have more time for us. Every night, after giving tuition, he would tend to our homework. During exam periods, we would have daily intense revision sessions with him. My homemaker mum is a perfectionist who took excellent care of our home and was always on top of our studies. Upon receiving our exam results, she would always sit down with us to go through our wrong answers, instructing us to try again until we got them right. My older sister and I always thought that doing well in school meant making our parents happy. Exam periods were very stressful for us, and we would often burn the midnight oil revising. As much as we wished that our parents were more lenient, we’re grateful. Without them, we wouldn’t be who we are today. But this work ethic carried on into our professional lives when we became working adults. I started working part-time at 14, doing sales administration for an apparel retailer. While pursuing my business degree at Nanyang Technological University, I waitressed in a campus cafe and spent my weekends giving maths and science tuition to secondary school students. Upon graduating at 22, I started my first full-time job in a digital marketing agency. At the same time, I worked part-time on weekends in a bar to earn extra cash. For four years, I spent all my weekdays working my full-time job, and all my weekends working my part-time job. I was so tired all the time and would suppress my feelings and thoughts that till today, this period of time is just a blur in my memory. This company had a very rigid culture. We were expected to be in the office and working already by 8.30am every day. Job training was provided only on the first day; beyond that, we had to be proactive in improving our own knowledge and skills on our own time. I really did enjoy the job, but it wasn’t easy. I spent many days working till almost midnight, skipping dinner. Being less experienced, I would often have to put on a brave face to deal with particularly disgruntled clients before going to cry in the bathroom afterwards. But that’s how it was in 2013. There was no such thing as “work-life balance” or “mental health awareness”. Working late meant you were pulling your weight; clocking out right on time told others you were lazy. I would carry my laptop with me all the time, even to family and friends’ gatherings and birthday celebrations — “just in case”. “Hustle culture” was my whole life, ingrained in me from childhood. I felt like I needed to always be productive. If I took some time to “just chill”, I would feel guilty for not spending my time “wisely”. More than a mindset, hustling soon became the measure of my self-worth. Only working hard and spending my time on work or productive things to better myself made me feel worthy and valuable as a person. After four years of long hours, little sleep and being “too busy” all the time, I was exhausted and burnt out. I quit my job and took some time off to travel and learn more about myself: What I like to do, who I am and want to be, and how to better make a difference in my life and the lives of those around me. I spent three months backpacking through Vietnam and Cambodia. Along the way, I learned that I am more capable and independent than I thought. Experiencing cultures so different from Singapore’s also taught me that slowing down doesn’t mean stagnation. In fact, slowing down gives me a better, clearer perspective of my life and how I spend my time. Armed with a renewed sense of purpose, I returned to Singapore and decided to start my own company. If you have spent any time in the advertising, marketing and public relations world, you’ll know that the phrase “agency life” is often uttered with a certain tone of knowing resignation: There’s no “life”, just “agency”. When I started my own agency in February 2017, my main objective was to ensure that my team wouldn’t have to go through what I did. Instead of overworking everyone, I make it a point to prioritise the strategic balance of our workload, and to share challenges and opportunities fairly among the team. During hiring interviews, I always ask potential employees what they want to achieve in their long-term career goals. Rather than lead by fear and intimidation, as I was led, I do my best to support them to reach their objectives. Company culture is no longer something to be imposed, but to be created and cultivated together as a team. I don’t believe I am perfect at motivating my team, but I am always learning and looking for ways to be better as the company grows. In the last six months, I have been to two friends' funerals. A third friend recently fell sick and is on extended leave from work. These have made me reflect a lot on how the last 12 years that I spent hustling have often led to me neglecting myself and my loved ones. I was always known as “the busy one”. After long days of meetings, networking, sales meetings, handling objections, conflicts and other difficult conversations, the only thing I want to do is to sleep. We’ve all heard the conventional wisdom on time management, but in recent years, I have been learning that energy management is equally important. There is a finite number of hours in each day, but we all have finite levels of energy, too. There is no badge of honour for the most overworked individual — something that I struggled to grasp, especially as an entrepreneur. I’m not there yet, but I’m slowly relearning that my self-worth is not measured by my work and being super busy and productive all the time. Hiring the right people with the right values and work ethic has been a great help, enabling me to delegate different tasks and responsibilities so I can commit my personal resources to the bigger picture. I’m also making it a point to decompress and recharge by spending quality time with my husband, family and friends. Driving at top speed all the time can get you where you want to go, but even the best of race-car drivers must stop to refuel and refill their tanks. Only by being fulfilled myself, can I pour that energy onto others around me. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Tan Wan Ting, 33, is the founder and marketing director of Weave Asia.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks If you told 20-year-old me that I would someday take a 75 per cent pay cut and leave my decade-long career to become a childless homemaker, I’d have told you that you weren’t being very Feminist. This audio is AI-generated. If you told 20-year-old me that I would someday take a 75 per cent pay cut and leave my decade-long career to become a childless homemaker, I’d have told you that you weren’t being very Feminist. Growing up, I was always taught that as a girl, I was “so lucky” to be able to have an education. We “need to” have a career so that we never have to rely on a man (in case he leaves you). We “have to” succeed at work while concurrently running an immaculate household, all while raising offspring and staying in shape (so that he wouldn’t leave you). On top of all that, close your legs when you sit! Wear shorts under your skirt! Don’t run around! Don’t talk back! Don’t ask so many questions. So, at 19, I took on my first full-time job in advertising while doing my degree part-time. For nearly three years, I worked through the day, went to school from 7-10pm, continued working until 3am, napped until 7am, woke up, hit the gym before going to work and repeating the cycle. I missed many family events, worked over many weekends, and proudly posted pictures on social media of me working on the office balcony with cringe-worthy captions like “Sunday things”. At 22, I moved out of my parents’ place so I could be independent. At 24, I worked in Shanghai for a few months (so fancy). At 25, I was earning a lot more than most of my peers who were just starting out. Having just got out of an abusive relationship, I’d also decided I was never going to get married. At 28, I hit my personal goal of becoming a senior planner before turning 30, earning over six figures annually — and I got engaged! Damn, was I crushing it at life or what. Joke’s on me — after nearly a decade of wearing the “Hardworking Feminist” badge so proudly, I developed a severe case of anxiety. In 2019, my fiancé Josh and I had recently moved into our resale flat that we could barely afford. I had just picked up a Muji bench we’d bought secondhand off Carousell, and in the lift up to our floor, I started feeling the onset of a panic attack. There were only two other people in the lift, but their quiet chatter felt suffocating. The second the lift doors opened, I sprinted through them and down the corridor, let myself in with shaking hands and laid on the living room floor, hyperventilating. The hum of the ceiling fan was unbearable. There was nowhere quiet enough for me. I tried to melt into the floor. I wanted to just dissipate. I called Josh, but I could barely manage words. He was overseas for a work trip, and had never dealt with a panic attack before. Bless his heart for enduring my loud, shallow breathing and whimpering while telling him to just shut up with grace and patience. I didn’t understand — why was I freaking out? At 28, I “had it all”. I had the job title I’d aimed for and worked towards for years. I commanded a salary that made my parents proud. I was about to marry an absolute stud, and we had our own cosy little home. I had it all, exactly the way everyone had talked about all throughout my youth. I even had house plants! My partner encouraged me to quit not just my job, but the whole industry. He also gently suggested I see a therapist — which I scoffed at, because I was an Independent Feminist, and I didn’t need help, and I needed my career. He also said that I could take time off work and take a sabbatical. “Do you know how crazy that sounds in this economy?” I ranted. “What if no one hires me again? What if I never earn the same?” On the inside, I was scared and rattled: What if he leaves me? I got angry at myself for being “weak” and “soft”. At work, I saw many gorgeous women “do it all”. They’d come into the office early after a workout, shower and paint their faces on. They held important roles, spoke clearly and confidently in meetings, and had a seat at the table. The sound of their heels clicking on the wooden floors was a ticking testament to their assured assertiveness. They took 9pm calls after putting their kids to bed. “Sorry, I’m two minutes late, it was so hard to get her to sleep tonight. Kids, right?” Polite laughter all around. That was meant to be me. After the panic attack, I didn’t know what I wanted out of life anymore. What I did know was this: I didn’t want to be constantly anxious, and my current lifestyle wasn’t sustainable for me or my partner. So, I did it. For me, for us, I quit my job. I quit the whole industry. I used to earn more than my husband, now he earns more than I do. I used to spend my days (and most nights) buried in work, only coming home to complain about work or getting black-out drunk to forget how much I hated my life. I decided to become a childless homemaker, depending on my husband to be the main breadwinner, while his bread paid for my therapy sessions. In therapy I learnt the single most important thing no one had ever told me before: There is no “should”. You get to choose the life you want; you get to set your own boundaries. I also learnt that for me, perfectionism and being “Type A” weren’t “born traits” as I’d always thought — rather, they were defence mechanisms. It took some time and a lot of uncomfortable self-reflection, but eventually I also learnt that true feminism isn’t about having it all, all the time. Instead, it is a balancing act. Being an independent woman isn’t doing everything on your own. There is nothing wrong with relying on your sisterhood and on your chosen “village” — in fact, doing so can be empowering, to make life work for all of us. Being a strong woman isn’t about putting up walls so that you never get hurt, but about setting boundaries so others know how to treat you. Since I quit my “feminist” career, I’ve been spending my time taking care of the home and our dog. I’ve started a small clothing business, held a pop-up market, became a boxing coach, started a weekly all-girls futsal game, picked up random freelance gigs like designing PowerPoint presentations or consulting on projects, helped lead beach clean-ups with Stridy, and started a podcast. I now work for a martial arts gym, devote a chunk of my time to raising funds for charities and causes I believe in, and have recently embarked on a quest to write a book. In between all of that, I’ll get a random text from a friend saying, “You free to hang out today?” Next thing I know, we’re at the beach picking seashells and enjoying the gentle waves on S$13 Decathlon floats, or we’re painting at her house, unskilled but unconstrained. I no longer own a blazer, underwired bra, or a single pair of high heels. Honestly, my younger self — still wrapped up in the chains of expectations and imposed aspirations — would look at me now and think, “Wow, what a failure”. She would be wrong though. Instead of striving to earn the right to live my best life, I’m finally living it. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Grace Ke, 32, is a boxing coach at Neue Fit and the founder of mental health podcast Naked.Graced.

After being unable to find a job for nine months, the author finally embraced the reality of being self-employed. This audio is AI-generated. I confess: I used to think I was a hotshot. In university, I frequently enjoyed fancy meals with senior members of staff in my role as a board director of the student union charity, which had an annual turnover of S$14 million. I thought I was smarter, better and more efficient than most of my colleagues. After all, with a first-class honours degree, awards, and glowing recommendations, I seemed fairly competitive. Not anymore. Not after the past 29 months, in which 278 job applications and 39 interviews turned up rejection after rejection. In October 2021, I decided not to renew my contract in social services. I wasn’t a cultural fit with the organisation. I also hoped to explore a different job, albeit in the same industry. At the time, I figured: “How hard can it get? The social service industry always needs people.” I had been actively applying for jobs from March 2021, but got no offers. I even chased down the emails of human resources personnel, trying to get them to give me some feedback. You would think that after getting rejected so many times, it would get easier. It never did. But what did get easier was taking control of my own destiny. At first, I thought I would get a new job fairly quickly. Sadly, that didn’t materialise. But I’d always had side interests. Even during my full-time job, I had been actively nurturing my skills in training, writing, and facilitating. I went for SkillsFuture courses like the Advanced Certificate in Learning and Performance, a train-the-trainer qualification. I even paid S$13,000 for a course on becoming a better speaker (though I definitely do not recommend you pay that amount). In August 2021, two months before I left my full-time job, one university offered to pay me for some training I would do for them. Granted, it may not be a significant amount of money to many — only S$1,000 — but it was money I had earned independently. I hadn’t relied on the reputation of a larger organisation. All I had was a tiny Private Limited company that I had incorporated in June 2020, with its grand office address being none other than my home. Whilst having my full-time job in 2020, I incorporated the company. I wanted to create an alternative source of financial security that didn’t come from my job. In November 2021, my first month out of a full-time job, I earned all of S$700. It’s not much, but it was enough money not to have to ask my parents for an allowance. And that, to me, was worth celebrating. As time passed, I picked up more gigs. I wrote articles about kindness, which paid S$150 per article. I facilitated focus group discussions about issues such as total defence. I served as tech support for an online training. I fumbled around with gigs like this for a year. All the while, I was still applying for jobs, but no one accepted me. I kept going with the gigs, not really knowing where I was going — just that I was still surviving. A year later, someone asked if I could help with their websites. At the time, I had only a rudimentary knowledge of making my own websites, but I was willing to try. From websites, I moved into digital marketing, running Google AdGrants, search engine optimisation campaigns, and helping businesses to rank higher on Google’s page one results. I had fun, and discovered maxims like “The best place to hide a dead body is on the second page of Google search results”. Today, I still do all of these — speaking, training, writing, marketing, web development, facilitating, on different days of the week. Some might think this is a “bad” way to lead a life, especially as a university graduate. People have asked: “What’s your long-term plan? How long can you survive like this?” What they are really asking is: “Are you being reckless?” Having seen my parents retrenched several times, and friends my age falling into despair after losing their “secure” full-time positions, I’ve come to see the precariousness of our jobs today. In a rapidly changing world, there are no guarantees that one will be able to keep their “steady” job. There is also no certainty that our skills will even continue to be relevant to the jobs we are currently in. Renowned strategic thinker Charles Handy suggests that in the S-curve of life, the moment we must transit is not at point B, where things have begun to take a downturn. This may be where we’re told we will be retrenched. Instead, it’s at point A, where things may be steadily getting better in your career. Because life is made up of cycles — what goes up will and must, sooner or later, come down. I was fortunate that I built these newfound skills while I still had the safety net of a full-time pay. But it wasn’t because I had more foresight than anyone else. There had never been any grand plan to survive so long without a job. It was simply because I was getting tired of what I was doing and wanted something new to engage me. Preparing ourselves for change by focusing on our strengths, and building or acquiring skills complementary to those strengths, allows us to ride the curve. When I first started working independently, the hardest thing was taking bus 51 back home. I would sit on the top level of the double-decker as it wound through Bugis Junction, looking at people queueing for restaurants like Hey! Yakiniku. I would feel a deep pang — of hunger, as my stomach growled, but also of uncertainty. I wondered: Would I ever feel financially secure enough to buy a meal at a restaurant, without worrying about the cost? With no income visibility from the stability of a full-time job, I felt it foolish to treat myself. I was hungry for that fancy meal. But I was also hungrier to make something work out on my own. With no one willing to give me a chance with a full-time job, my back was to the wall, and I had to fight. And I think it’s in that fighting that you find life itself, and something worth fighting for. One of my favourite quotes comes from When Breath Becomes Air, a book neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi wrote when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. \"Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving. Describing life otherwise was like painting a tiger without stripes. After so many years of living with death, I’d come to understand that the easiest death wasn’t necessarily the best. We talked it over. Our families gave their blessing. We decided to have a child. We would carry on living, instead of dying.\" Looking for work is a difficult process. Some may never have to fully understand or experience how tough it can be. But when no employer will give you a chance, sometimes what helps is to give yourself the first chance. To look for the small gigs you’ve always wanted to do, however little they pay. To make something that you can sell — cupcakes, or even your yoga teaching services. To worry less about the future, and to take life one day at a time. To move away from thinking in polarities: It’s not really about having a job or being jobless, but learning to manage the tension between planning long-term and surviving for the short term. Each day we have a choice between choosing to live, making the most of this fighting chance, or letting ourselves succumb to dark, life-defeating thoughts. Reframing “I am jobless”, to “I am fighting for my livelihood” reminded me that there was something worth fighting for. Things might not get immediately better, but you will get stronger.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Whenever someone asks me what I do in a bank, they’re surprised when I tell them I work with migrant workers. Gen Y speaks writer Rishma Theru, 28, poses for a photo at the POSB Work Permit Account Service Centre on March 27, 2024. She is a business manager for the Work Permit segment at DBS Bank's Consumer Banking Group where she works with migrant workers. This audio is AI-generated. Whenever someone asks me what I do in a bank, they’re surprised when I tell them I work with migrant workers. As a university graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in business studies and finance, most people expect me to be in corporate or private banking, rubbing shoulders with high-net-worth individuals and the like. My current department handles the work permit segment. When I first joined four years ago, I was concerned about the fluency of my spoken Tamil — but to be honest, I wasn’t too sure about the prospect of working with migrant workers. Like many of my friends and relatives, I harboured a jaundiced view of migrant workers at the time, a perception that was probably unhelpfully shaped by the Little India riots in 2013. My parents were concerned as well, but nevertheless I decided to take a leap of faith and try it out. I told myself that there was a job to be done, and I would just go into this with an open mind. Within the first few months of taking on my new role, my misconceptions slowly melted away. As I helped migrant and domestic workers with their account opening and banking enquiries, I found them shy, polite and appreciative of the help rendered to them. Even so, it was still a job to me then and nothing more. That was the case until 2020, when I completed one year in the role. I remember how I was put in touch with the wife of a migrant worker who had passed away from a workplace incident that fateful year. She had contacted her husband’s employer to seek help for the money in his POSB account to be transferred back to India. That was the very first time my department and I had to assist with a request from a deceased worker’s next-of-kin. Frankly, I was worried: What if I made a mistake that could hinder the speedy resolution of the request? I was also sad that a man’s life had ended — what if I couldn’t keep my emotions in check when speaking with his wife? She lived in a small village in Coimbatore, a city in Tamil Nadu, India, and I had to do multiple calls with her to get the required information and documents mailed to Singapore in order to process the remittance request. It was a laborious process as we had to liaise with many different parties. I also had to keep my emotions in check whenever I spoke with the widow. I knew I could not do much to assuage her grief, but I resolved to do what was within my means to the best of my ability. So, I expedited the paperwork for the worker’s hard-earned savings to be remitted to his family in India, who urgently needed the money to get by. It took a lot of work, but the wife received the funds within a month. As she expressed her relief and gratitude, it struck me then that my job wasn’t “just a job”. It meant so much more to the people on the receiving end of my assistance. From that point on, I began to see my role in a new light. My team and I also partner with government agencies and non-government organisations to conduct workshops under the POSB’s Work Permit Holders Digital Literacy programme for migrant and domestic workers. An important aspect of our workshops is teaching these vulnerable groups to identify scam calls and messages such as emails. Foreign domestic workers risk falling prey to scammers with fake job offers promising fast cash, while migrant workers are especially susceptible to scammers posing as government officials. We typically run two workshops a month for up to 200 migrant workers at a time. For domestic workers, because of their rest days, we run workshops on alternate months for between 60 and 80 attendees. One of the main challenges faced by migrant workers is the language barrier, as many of them have limited proficiency in English. This makes it difficult for them to interpret messages effectively, leading to misunderstandings and potential exploitation. Working in a new environment further compounds the risks. As they are unfamiliar with local law processes, this group could be easily cowed into giving away their banking credentials when faced with intimidation or threats by “government officials”. Amid the rising prevalence of scams, I wanted to do more to extend and expand our digital literacy outreach to migrant workers. In 2023, I initiated a “train-the-trainer programme” where I would educate a few “big brothers” and “big sisters” as digital literacy ambassadors, so that they could go out and share their knowledge with fellow workers and friends. Since the programme’s start, I have personally trained 40 ambassadors. As I continue to become more invested in what I do, I found that my work is not just a job, but also about fulfilling a desire to help the vulnerable. Because migrant and domestic workers work long hours and are often unable to visit bank branches during office hours, I would head out to condominiums, hospitals, and construction sites after office hours and even on weekends, just so I could reach out to these groups. I assist them with their banking queries and difficulties, and listen to them sharing their personal problems. Making sure that my phone is switched on around the clock, I often get WhatsApp messages late at night seeking advice on a myriad of issues. I’ve spent the past three Deepavalis at dormitories celebrating the festive occasion with migrant workers, as well as conducting digital literacy sessions on a public holiday. At the beginning, I would tell myself to draw a clearer distinction between work and my personal life, but the more people I met and the more I came to understand their concerns and issues, the more I found myself motivated to help them in whatever little way I could. I’ve also found friends: Last year, I invited Krishna — a migrant worker from India and one of the ambassadors I trained — to my house for dinner with my family. It can be lonely being away from your loved ones on a major festive occasion such as Deepavali. It warmed my heart when Krishna thanked me for opening my house to him and allowing him to feel a sense of family on this special day. In a world where self-advancement often takes centre stage, it's easy to turn a blind eye to the struggles faced by others, especially those sidelined to the margins of mainstream society. I’ve learnt that it’s important for Singapore to continue amplifying the voices of migrant and domestic workers by providing platforms for them to share their stories and perspectives, and to advocate for themselves, whether through art, media, or community forums. We must also continue to create more inclusive environments that are welcoming and supportive of the vulnerable groups who have travelled far from their homelands and communities to build our houses and roads and look after our parents and children. The past four years have taught me that life is about so much more than chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In an increasingly digitalised world with widening social and economic inequality, I believe that everyone can give a little of themselves to bring about positive change. In the grand scheme of things, my efforts may be just a ripple — but even the smallest of ripples can become a big wave of change.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Can you remember the last time you disagreed with somebody? Can you remember the last time you disagreed with somebody? This audio is AI-generated. Can you remember the last time you disagreed with somebody? How did you tell them about it? What were you more concerned about — whether you were communicating your point effectively, or whether you were in danger of offending them or hurting their feelings? Did you tell them to their face? Or did you wait till you parted ways to drop them a text? Did you even tell them at all? Or did you confide your dissent only to trusted friends, knowing they would keep your secret? On a recent trip with friends, we spent a week giggling our way through South Korea. We drove on the wrong lane in Jeju, tried raw marinated crab for the first time in Yeosu, and gorged ourselves on street food in Seoul. We slept on futons in a traditional Korean hotel and joked about being in our Jewel in the Palace era. We ziplined off the 24th floor of a Ramada hotel and made fun of ourselves for it on social media: “Your unemployed friends on a Tuesday afternoon”. Wanting to spend more time together, we shelled out for an AirBnB large enough to accommodate us all. We got to know each other better over long conversations about our families and friends, our past lovers and partners, and our jobs (for real though, do you know what your friends actually do for work?). We were having a good time. For dinner on our last night, someone suggested Korean BBQ (or, as it’s known there, BBQ). It’s a truth universally acknowledged that last-night dinners on overseas trips are special. People are worn in by then, happy but exhausted. Guards are let down; everything seems to draw out longer and lazier as we try to make the most of these last hours. The part of the dinner where we were actually eating food transitioned into the part where we picked at the remaining “courtesy” morsels, just to have an excuse to keep talking. A sensitive topic came up in conversation. Nothing new — we’re generally pretty comfortable with discussing all sorts of things with each other, and had been doing so throughout the entire trip. One of the group voiced an opinion they described as “preference”. I felt it was prejudice — and I told them so, right then and there. A debate sparked right away — not heated, exactly, but it ramped up the longer it went on. The whole group got involved. Everybody wanted to share their take on it; everybody wanted to know what was behind each other’s take. Soon enough, other sensitive topics were drawn into the fray. Not being one to mince words, I once again expressed a contrary sentiment — and that’s when something snapped. People lost control of their emotions. We talked over each other. Spoke in accusatory tones. Got personal. It went on as we paid the bill and left the restaurant. It went on in the cab ride home. It went on once we were back in our AirBnB. All considered, it went on for nearly five hours, give or take. (There was definitely a moment or two where I lowkey regretted our halcyon decision to get that AirBnB together.) What were we talking about? Frankly, it doesn’t matter. It could have been anything, really. What I did find myself thinking about long after that conversation had ended was the nature of disagreement. It’s no surprise that a lot of people aren’t comfortable with disagreement — the very concept does inherently require some measure of tension or friction, after all. That discomfort is compounded several times over when it’s in relation to a sensitive topic, and understandably so. This is why politics and sexuality are big no-no’s for first-date conversations. Singaporeans, in particular, are notoriously apprehensive when it comes to talking about race and race-related issues . The key concerns are always the same: It’s too easy to offend; people are too easily offended. But what does it really mean to offend, or to be offended? Surely there can be no harm in expressing a personal thought or sentiment as long as it’s supported with genuine, positive intent? What if what we’re really afraid of is disagreement itself? Humans are communal animals. No one likes feeling alone, or like we’re being forcibly divided or separated from others. This is the entire basis and appeal of social media: Connect with people whenever you want from wherever you are! Find others who like the same things you like, so you never have to like them alone! But all that communality cannot change the fact that we are individualised persons, each with our own thoughts and feelings. It’s what makes human connection so powerful and beautiful. It’s also the reason why we will never be able to create an environment, physical or virtual, that is completely free of disagreement. To be fair, disagreement can be scary sometimes — but that doesn’t mean we have to be afraid of it. Picture two people living together in one house. Disagreement doesn’t automatically mean one of them moving out into a different house. It can simply be the occupants working together to create a new room within the house — carving out space for more of their individual selves to fit under the same roof. In that sense, disagreement doesn’t have to mean opposition or divergence. Instead, it can be an avenue of diversification and deeper intimacy. The key to this distinction is intention: Are we seeking total alignment and affirmation for the sake of self-assurance, or are we seeking real and whole understanding of others’ perspectives? Are we willing to make room within ourselves to hold those perspectives, even if they may be different from what we want or believe? In case you’re wondering, all friendships in our group remain alive and well. But towards the end of that long, long night, one of the group observed that it’s pretty rare for friends and other social groups to be able to disagree as intensely as we had done and still be able to carry on with the friendship or social connection. I can’t speak for each of them — but for me personally, it’s going to take a lot more than a difference in opinion to break me apart from someone I’ve made a decision to love. Perhaps it’s time to start trusting that the bonds we share with our loved ones are a lot stronger than we give them credit for.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks I stumbled into the world of software engineering almost by accident. Avery Lim's journey as a software engineer started out smoothly — but the further she progressed, the more the shadows of imposter syndrome began to creep in. This audio is AI-generated. I stumbled into the world of software engineering almost by accident. As a film student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, my days were filled with storytelling and capturing emotions through the lens. It was during my last year that I caught a glimpse of a different kind of narrative — the language of code. I’ve always been interested in creative pursuits, but being a perfectionist by nature, coding captured my attention for how its creative potential is carefully balanced with technical rules — totally on the opposite end of the spectrum from film, which I always found to be more subjective. Intrigued, I delved into online courses on edx, Coursera and more, bright-eyed and eager to explore this new frontier. As graduation crept closer and the rest of my peers decided on their post-education paths, I decided to take a leap of faith and transition into web engineering so that I could still retain some of my creative roots. I was excited to venture into uncharted territory, but doubts lingered. How could a film student navigate the intricate world of coding without a traditional computer science foundation? Thankfully, my first employer took a chance on my potential, allowing me to pursue passion projects (such as a colour picker tool and other games) as well as a handful of short internships and more. It felt great to be given this kind of space and encouragement while I was still in the process of picking up coding. And so, my journey as a software engineer started out smoothly — but the further I progressed, the more the shadows of imposter syndrome began to creep in. The lack of a conventional computer science background that once helped me to stand out from the crowd now became a source of self-doubt. Every challenge and every problem felt like a test of my legitimacy. Each hurdle seemed to be a reminder that perhaps, with the proper basics and fundamentals, I would have been able to overcome them more quickly and easily. These feelings grew stronger when I changed companies, mere weeks before Covid-19 hit. During the pandemic, it took me a long time to be onboarded to the new company, and being suspended in an extended limbo made me feel even more uncertain. The remote work setting also made seeking guidance more challenging. Being a Chinese woman in a workplace predominantly comprising Caucasian men was also a new, unfamiliar experience (I was working in Berlin at this time). My colleagues were so talented and experienced that I genuinely felt like I was nothing more than a diversity hire. I felt like I was lagging behind in almost every way. I was deeply insecure about my accomplishments and capabilities, in a way I’ve never experienced before. The guidance and encouragement I received became a lifeline, helping me navigate the turbulent seas of self-doubt. I also actively engaged in self-improvement and worked on the areas I knew I lacked in (both technical and soft skills) to increase my self-confidence. Embracing opportunities despite self-doubt formed my personal mantra. I realised that growth is often found outside our comfort zones. To be honest, imposter syndrome never fully goes away — at least not in my experience. But eventually, I learnt to deal with it. Now, whenever these feelings kick in again, I reframe my thoughts from “I’m a fraud and I can’t actually do this” to “My brain is telling me that I can’t do this because it wants to protect me from disappointment”. I make an effort to recognise the fear for what it is, but also to recognise my own abilities and achievements. It’s taken me a while to appreciate this, but despite lacking a conventional computer science background, the unique experiences along my journey were way more valuable in shaping me into a proficient engineer. Learning about visual technicalities in film such as composition, for example, really helped me hone my eye for detail. Today, I am working towards becoming an engineering manager at foodpanda, where I will be responsible for organically acquiring and converting quality users with a seamless onboarding experience. There’s a famous saying by Canadian hockey legend Wayne Gretzky: “You miss 100 per cent of the shots you don’t take.” I completely understand and empathise with my female peers who hesitate before applying to a job in tech, finance, or any other male-dominated field, despite the fact that they may be the perfect candidate for the role. It’s only human to want to avoid failure, hurt and disappointment, but if we let that doubt and fear hold us back, we will never know what we’re truly capable of. As for me? I’m glad to have pushed through that mental block and applied for my very first software engineering position. It’s always easier said than done — but at the end of the day, it’s important to just do it! ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Avery Lim, 28, is an engineering manager at foodpanda.

But life had other plans in store for me. Edwin Gan, 34, has Grade 3 astrocytoma, a malignant, incurable brain tumour that affects one in 100,000 people. This audio is AI-generated. In 2022, I was on top of the world. I was 32 years old, eagerly awaiting the arrival of my first child, while getting ready to start a promising new career as a financial adviser. Little did I know that life had other plans in store for me. Three months before the birth of my child, I started having unexplained seizures. Given that I had just returned from Canada the week before, the initial diagnosis from the doctors was tick fever. I was sent into an MRI scan, which revealed the life-altering truth: I had Grade 3 astrocytoma, a malignant, incurable brain tumour that affects one in 100,000 people. Shock and terror overwhelmed me. How was I going to break the news to my family, including my pregnant wife? At a loss with how to deal with both my condition and my emotional turmoil, I fell victim to toxic positivity. Despite my doctors’ warnings to prepare myself for a tough journey ahead, I underestimated the challenges waiting for me, believing the brain surgery to be the toughest part. I thought I could breeze through this ordeal. At the time, I think I needed to believe it. Reality soon proved me wrong. The surgery turned out to be just the first hurdle. Only 90 per cent of my tumour was removed — enough to prevent the risk of paralysis — which meant I still needed extensive further treatment. This next period of treatment proved to be far more gruelling: 30 sessions of radiotherapy over six weeks, along with six cycles of chemotherapy over six months. To take my mind off things, I tried to keep myself busy after the surgery. However, returning to work during treatment was even more challenging than I’d anticipated. Even simple things like using my iPad for 10 minutes left me fatigued and dizzy. On one occasion, I had a seizure right after a virtual meeting with a client. The inability to perform even the most basic tasks rendered me all but useless. I was forced to take a step back from my career for most of 2023. While this meant I could focus on getting better, it was also an immediate loss of income for my family. The cumulative costs of treatment came up to more than S$300,000 — and I was fortunate that this was largely covered by my hospital insurance plan. What was difficult for me to manage were the out-of-pocket costs like transportation and medication. I also had a new baby to take care of and living expenses to manage. The thought of entering financial ruin plunged me further into despair. The stress, fear and pain were too much for me to bear at times. I even confided in my wife Natalie dark thoughts I’d had about giving up and ending it all. Fortunately, the burden was alleviated by my comprehensive insurance coverage, including a critical illness rider which provided a lump sum payout upon my diagnosis. I’m lucky that my work in insurance had taught me the importance of having sufficient coverage — a lesson reinforced by meeting others who regretted their lack of coverage. My forethought had saved us from ruin. This became a lifeline in my darkest hours, allowing me to persevere and redirect my energy towards my recovery and family. The timing of my daughter’s birth was both a blessing and a challenge — after my initial surgery and radiotherapy, but before I began chemotherapy. Already feeling depleted from the earlier treatments, her arrival stoked a renewed energy in me, one that motivated and enabled me to face the impending chemotherapy sessions. However, while on oral medication for chemotherapy, I couldn’t share food or use the same toilet as my family. Residue of the powerful medication in my saliva and urine could potentially cause skin allergies in others, which was especially dangerous for my newborn daughter. This necessary isolation during my treatment intensified the already harsh effects of therapy. Additionally, the surgery rendered my left foot immobile for a few months, further hindering my ability to be fully present and supportive for my wife and daughter. During that time, I was so weak that I couldn’t take Natalie out for date nights or fulfil my role as a father to our little Gemma. After all the months spent anticipating my baby’s coming, I couldn’t even carry her now. I’m grateful to Natalie, who stepped up to take on the role of primary caregiver for our child, all while juggling the demands of her own postpartum recovery and tending to both our needs without a single complaint. Even so, being unable to look after my family neither financially nor emotionally sent my mental health plummeting to an all-time low. As long as I can remember, I had always been the “stoic” male in my family. I am usually able to regulate my emotions relatively well. When I’m in a rut, I always manage to find solutions to fix my problems. This time, though, I just couldn’t seem to find the answers. More than being afraid, I was desperate. I spent many months teetering on the brink of depression. There were moments when I’d sneak away to the bathroom after my family fell asleep to cry, wondering if I had any resilience left in the face of such adversity. During this time, I learnt to embrace vulnerability. I found solace in an unexpected source: My wife’s gynaecologist, Dr Anne Hagarty. Opening up to Natalie and Anne about my mental health struggles was initially daunting, as I had always been able to control my emotions on my own. However, I soon learnt to accept the comfort that their understanding and support offered me. Anne quickly became like a second mother to me. She was a beacon of wisdom and compassion that lit my way in the darkness. One time, she took my hand and told me: “Edwin, you knew right at the get-go that this journey is going to be arduous. The only way that you’ll lose is if you quit.” This realisation spurred me to persevere. Over time, I learned to lean on the unwavering support of other loved ones and even colleagues, who became additional pillars of strength. Meditation and exercise also became pivotal to my emotional and physical recovery. Maintaining an active lifestyle and finding catharsis in movement really helped me regain strength and resilience over time. I am still not completely free from cancer. My recovery post-treatment has been progressing well, though. I undergo MRI brain scans every four months and maintain regular consultations with my medical team. This journey isn’t over yet — but it has already taught me the importance of cherishing every moment, especially with my loved ones. Something as simple as celebrating my daughter’s first birthday now means the world to me, because I don’t know how many birthdays I can spend with her. Natalie and I have had frequent discussions about our family’s future. While we hope to expand our family soon, the fear and lingering threat of death still casts a shadow over our dreams and plans. I never expected to be diagnosed with cancer. Perhaps I should have known better. After all, this is a common misconception in my line of work: “I’m young, healthy, with no immediate health risks or dangers. What could possibly go wrong?” However, my experience has taught me how fragile and precious life is. It’s given me a newfound sense of empathy and understanding of the resilience of the human spirit. Because of this, I’ve also found myself growing more attentive and understanding towards my wife. Learning to listen more and express myself with greater honesty and vulnerability has strengthened our bond and deepened our love for one another. My friends and family have also begun to see a different side of me. I now make an effort to reflect and share more openly thoughtfully, which has led to more intimate and meaningful conversations. It’s even changed the way I approach work. I find myself more sensitive to clients’ needs and situations, and more motivated to support them in their goals of protecting both their wealth and their loved ones. Above all, it’s taught me that the most valuable things in life are those that cannot be represented by numbers and figures.

What can be so wrong with spending our own money on things that seem like imprudent purchases to others, but provide to us some unconventional or intangible benefit? This audio is AI-generated. A few weeks ago, I messaged two of my friends to tell them that I spent a few hundred dollars on massage packages. One of these was a tummy and womb massage package that was touted to help one shed inches off the waist — not really necessary for me as I have a healthy waist-hip ratio. Another was a breast massage package that purportedly firms one’s breasts — again, not the most relevant for me, as my relatively flat chest offers minimal breast tissue for the therapist to work with. These were seemingly frivolous purchases, ones that I do not really require. Both experiences were fun and novel, and unlike any of the traditional massages I have done before. I enjoyed seeing the therapists bring in new and adorable-looking machines: A pink-coloured suction machine used on the breasts; a few metal plates that created slight warmth when placed around one’s tummy before the tummy massage. I posted a photo of the pink suction machine on my Instagram Story, gathering several curious and delighted responses from friends, who had likewise never seen such a device before. Ever inquisitive about the latest trends in the beauty and wellness space, I also took it as a learning opportunity to improve consumer knowledge. I asked them about the techniques used at these massages, which are varied based on one’s goals, such as detoxification, lymphatic drainage, and firming. After all, one reason I signed up for the packages was an ongoing promotion with a 70 per cent discount for first-timers who had completed their first trial session for a fraction of the original price. The therapist also promised me that if I signed up for a package of 10 sessions, she’d give me an extra four sessions for free. So really, I reasoned in my head, I’d actually saved money through these purchases — “girl math”. However, upon hearing the news of my recent splurges, one of my peers verbalised that these purchases were rather unwise. Slowly, I was overcome by a sense of guilt for making what seemed to others to be spending mistakes. “I feel a bit bad for purchasing these non-essentials,” I chuckled to one of my friends, feeling tickled but a little embarrassed at what I had done. “Well, self-care is important,” she replied. “If it makes you happy then why not?” She added that she too budgets for expenditures such as manicure and hair treatments that sometimes do not last long but keep her in a good mood or help her get through tough or stressful times. Another friend cited that many of her female peers apply girl math on non-essential items that may seem like extravagant purchases, but give them great satisfaction overall. She herself often buys slightly overpriced oat milk lattes several times a week, which keep her cheerful and productive throughout the workday. Buying oat milk lattes is often used as a classic example of girl math in action. Yet, she has no qualms in doing this as long as her budget allows for it, as she would rather save on other aspects of her life like transport and clothes. She has also never considered making her own oat milk lattes, as she is no domestic goddess and does not have much bandwidth for the purchasing of ingredients, doing the dishes and clean-up. The cost spent on these, she claims, may be more than just purchasing a ready-made oat milk latte. We all admittedly work long and hard. It is no exaggeration that for most young Singaporeans, the majority of our time is spent on work, studies, fitness and the occasional catch-ups with friends. What can be so wrong with spending our own money on some items that seem like imprudent purchases to others, but provide to us some unconventional or intangible benefit that makes perfect sense from our point of view? Granted, some more extreme examples of girl math may be downright illogical. These include the claims that spending in a foreign currency does not amount to spending money, or that a very big-ticket item like a car can have its price divided to “cost per second” so that the costs are negligible. However, assuming one has achieved some measure of financial independence and stability, girl math can help one come to terms with purchasing decisions that appear silly to others, but are well worth the price tag to oneself. So far, I have gone for several sessions of tummy massages and breast massages. Each session still gives me a lot of joy and amusement. I am far from regretting spending my hard-earned money on this. In fact, I might even extend my package in the future — depending on what makes me happy, not others around me. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Alvona Loh Zi Hui is a medical doctor who works in Singapore.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks The tears that flowed once I crossed the finish line at the 19th Asian Games on Oct 2, 2023, pretty much said it all. In 2017, national sprinter Shanti Pereira (above) felt like \"a complete failure\" due to a series of setbacks in both her professional and personal lives, including not being able to clinch a gold medal at that year's SEA Games. Here's how she found her footing again over the next few years. This audio is AI-generated. The tears that flowed once I crossed the finish line at the 19th Asian Games on Oct 2, 2023, pretty much said it all. It was the cherry on top of a magical 2023 season: I broke national records and personal bests, I championed the continent on a few occasions, heard Majulah Singapura play from atop those podiums and, sweetest of all, qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics. For context, this does not come by very often. Athletes generally don’t see this many successes and continued breakthroughs in such a short period of time. But that’s just how it is in a sport: It’s normal not to see progress for a while. With that, I have so many people to thank for a truly magical year: My coach, family, sport science team, and the list goes on. I have myself to thank, too. I owe my success to my younger self, who had to go through years of doubt, desolation, and unlucky circumstances in order to get here. But all those experiences only made her stronger than ever before. A lot of people know me as Singapore’s Sprint Queen — a title I first got in 2013 when I became the first woman to run the 100m event in under 12 seconds and the 200m in 24 seconds. This label gained even more traction after I clinched Singapore’s first sprint gold at the 2015 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games. Before that, we hadn’t won one in 42 years. This was a pivotal time in my track and field journey. I was launched into both the athletic scene as well as the public eye, and from this point on, I got a taste of what being in high-performance sports is like. I stepped onto a new track, one that came with amazing opportunities, incredible exposure, and a pathway to pursue this sport long-term. But it also came with a lot of expectations and a lot of pressure, both external and internal, which I was neither prepared for nor had the experience to fully understand and accept. Perhaps it was arrogance; perhaps it was just a lack of dealing with the immense pressures following a remarkable feat. Regardless of what it was, when I could not uphold the same title of SEA Games Gold Medallist in 2017, I felt like a complete failure. I thought I no longer had what it took to be Singapore’s Sprint Queen. At the same time, I was coming off a less than ideal coach-athlete relationship and other life struggles, including the loss of two academic scholarships within a week of each other. I had to figure out how I was going to settle my tuition fees, along with extra cash for spending and saving. All these setbacks made for some rough years as a young adult. I found myself at such a loss of what to do and who I was. I succumbed to what others thought of my abilities, giving them the power to dictate what I should do with my life. I questioned everything about myself, to the point where I became so afraid of even approaching the start line. My mind was stuck in a cloud of fear and uncertainty: Once I crossed the finish line, would another wave of disappointment kick in? Would people say I was weak, that I was not good enough? Right before the 31st SEA Games in May 2022, something clicked. “Who cares?” I realised. “Who cares what people think? Why am I allowing them to define who I am? I started track 18 years ago because I loved it — why should I let people who matter the least to me determine my next steps?” Suddenly, my mind was clear. I knew exactly what I had to do, and how to do it. I started to look at my failures and mistakes less as weaknesses, but more as strengths — points of my life that I could learn from to become more of a master in my speciality, and to become a better version of myself. Why bother wallowing in self-pity when there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it anymore? I can’t change the past, so why not think instead about how to do better in the future? I’ve never thought that resilience is something people are born with — but I did think of it as something everyone organically builds simply by experiencing setbacks, failures and mistakes. What I’ve learned is that resilience is a result of actually learning from these setbacks and failures and choosing to alter your path ahead of you for the better. I was no longer afraid, and I found my love for the sport again. Fast forward to January 2024: I successfully defended my 200m SEA Games title two years in a row (2022 and 2023) and earned the gold in the 100m in 2023 as well. I ran the 200m in under 23 seconds for the first time, became Singapore's first Asian Champion in both events, made it to the semifinals of the World Championships, qualified for the Olympics and earned the 200m Gold and 100m Silver at the 19th Asian Games — all while setting personal bests, national and championship records in the process. The best part is that I am nowhere near done. I’m now training towards the next big thing: The 2024 Paris Olympics in July. I’m having the time of my life — all because I decided to live my life for myself, not for others. High expectations and tough pressures are part and parcel of being an athlete, so I now cope with it by accepting it for what it is — something that naturally occurs when achieving something great in the public eye that is simply beyond my control. So, I’ve stopped trying to control the expectations, pressures, and the comments from strangers on the Internet. Instead, I focus on the things that I can control: My training and competition plans, my personal routines, staying disciplined and consistent in my habits, and my attitude and adaptability. In professional sports, hard work is not enough. Being an athlete is not confined to time spent on the track. It’s a 24/7 job, placing my sport as a priority above everything else and continually working on recovery, which is just as important as showing up to the track, if not more so. It requires big lifestyle changes, and an intentional change in perspective of what I do. Gearing up for Paris 2024, my plans for the year are made up of large sacrifices. I have to spend the majority of my time overseas, away from friends and family, missing events and milestones along the way. I have to stay disciplined with my time and routines on a daily basis — no late nights, no casual drinking, and eating right, all of which can be hard to maintain for months on end. Because of these demands, my circle of friends has naturally grown smaller — but I’m not upset about it, because the people who have remained truly understand my lifestyle and have shown that they will support me no matter what. The inaugural Singapore Resilience Study, released in September 2023 by Income Insurance Limited and Centre for Research on Successful Ageing at the Singapore Management University, categorises resilience into four domains — physical, mental, financial and social. Personally, I see that all four types are important for each of us to be empowered to overcome the challenges we face in life. Ultimately, I do not regret those seven years of hardship because they have made me into the person I am today, and I’m proud of that. To anyone out there who may be struggling to find your footing again — don’t be afraid to accept your mistakes, learn from them and come back stronger. One of the lessons my past struggles have taught me is to be more prudent in my spending and save as much as I can for the future. It’s true that sports careers don’t last as long as others do, but all I can do is to, again, focus on the things I can control. I’m thankful that I’ve gotten to a point in my career where I can see a steady pay cheque, racing bonuses and additional media engagements. I have paid back my student loans entirely, and saved up enough to begin making investments that will help me build the future I want, whatever obstacles and hardships I may face. I take these lessons with me throughout every single point of my life. In my sport and my life now — and in the future, when I eventually retire — my strategies will remain the same. I will focus on the things within my control, embrace every single opportunity that I get, appreciate the people around me and enjoy the process, no matter what it might be. Regardless of who’s watching on the sidelines of my life, it’s me on the track, putting one foot in front of the other. Only I have the power to determine what happens in my journey.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks In the weeks leading up to GCE O-Level results day, I already had a gnawing feeling that I would not do well. Gen Y Speaks writer Ryan Goh, who writes about turning his life around with the help of his mentors during his youth, and how he gives back by volunteering to mentor youths in his job at DBS Bank. This audio is AI-generated. In the weeks leading up to GCE O-Level results day, I already had a gnawing feeling that I would not do well. The year was 2006. At 19, I was already lagging behind my peers because I had to repeat Secondary 5 after failing my N-Levels. In the midst of my despondency, I knew I had it coming. As the youngest and only son in the family, my parents had high hopes of me academically. Dad was a taxi driver and mom was a sales assistant; neither of them were highly educated themselves. Being traditional Chinese, they firmly believed that education was a stepping stone to a good job. Their academic expectations of me were also heightened by my two older sisters’ good performance: They were both more academically inclined, and had comfortably made it to junior college and polytechnic respectively. I was the ne’er-do-well, frequently playing truant in secondary school and spending most of my time at the arcade. I was an unmotivated individual with no desire to study, because I didn’t find joy in it. Rote learning — straight memorisation of maths formulae or science theories without knowing how to apply them — didn’t work for me. I just wanted to have fun with my friends. The eternal optimist in me figured: What’s the worst that could happen? Maybe I wouldn’t make it into my desired course (an IT diploma in a polytechnic). Surely I’d have other options. But no amount of distraction or fun could help me escape my day of reckoning. On Feb 10, 2006, reality shattered delusion when I received my GCE O-Level results. I’d scored D7 for both English and Mathematics; my best grades were a couple of B’s for mother tongue and humanities. I couldn’t even qualify for polytechnic at all. My dreams were dashed. With no other alternative, I had to enrol in the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Like many others in 2006, I harboured a lowly perception of ITE education, perpetuated by the (then) popularity of Jack Neo’s I Not Stupid movie series. The running joke among Singaporeans was that “ITE” stood for “It’s The End”. At the time, the base expectation was that in order to get a good job and salary, one would need to attain a polytechnic diploma at the very least. I was utterly despondent and unmotivated. I ended up barely scraping through my first year in ITE with a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. I didn’t know where to turn to for advice and guidance, and my grades continued to plummet, dropping below the borderline threshold of 2.0. One day, it struck me that I might just get kicked out of ITE and fall even deeper into the sinkhole I was already trapped in. Without any paper qualifications and skills at all, I would not be able to support my ageing parents. I started to buck up in Year 2. By the power of good old-fashioned mugging, I managed to bring my GPA up to 2.4 by my final year. It was just barely enough for me to scrape through into Republic Polytechnic for my desired course, Business IT. After completing my national service, I finally entered polytechnic at the ripe old age of 24. Most of my classmates were six or seven years younger than me, which was kind of surreal. Surrounded by teenagers, I felt an urgent need to make up for lost time. I studied, more than I’d ever done before. Every night, after school, I would go through my notes and prepare for the following day’s lessons. For the first time in my academic journey, I found guidance and encouragement in a couple of my lecturers: Ms Sharon Tan, who supervised my final-year project, and Mr Soon Yoong Kit, who advised me on my further education options and was also instrumental in helping me secure an internship with Accenture in my final year. I took it upon myself not to let down my lecturers who had invested so much time in helping me. More importantly, I realised that time and tide was not going to wait for me, and this could be my last opportunity. I graduated from Republic Polytechnic with a GPA of 3.73, and managed to secure a place among the pioneer batch for the marketing and analytics degree at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Once again, a mentor came into my life in the form of Mr Lim Chee Han. Mr Lim, my lecturer in the first year and supervisor for my final-year project, was invested in helping me be the best I could be. He wasn’t like most educators I’d encountered up till that point — he didn’t like students to just memorise and regurgitate theories from textbooks. He offered me guidance on projects and coursework, and taught me to focus on deeper, more abstract thinking to connect the dots, which is an essential skill for a business and data analyst. He also spent time and effort helping me build up my confidence. He was well-spoken and articulate — and, for the first time, I had a role model whose behaviour I could emulate. In poly, I also learnt to seek out peer mentorship — or, as I thought of it, “reverse mentoring”. Presentations are a key component of polytechnic coursework. As someone who is not very proficient in spoken English, I often found myself struggling through them and marvelling at how articulate and assured my younger classmates were. Despite our age gap, I didn’t have any compunction in reaching out to ask them for guidance on polishing my public speaking and presentation skills. I would usually get ribbed by them initially because of my improper English — but any good-natured jokes were always followed up with practical, helpful advice. Looking back at my academic struggles, I realise how mentorship had been the catalyst for real change in my journey. Seeking and receiving guidance from others had helped me to improve in ways I otherwise couldn’t do on my own, both as a student and an individual. This is how I’m paying it forward. Last year, I signed up to be a mentor in the newly launched DBS x ITE mentorship programme, organised under the bank’s employee volunteering initiative People of Purpose. Under this mentorship programme, bank employees spend half a day each month for five months with students from ITE. I had four mentees under my charge from my alma mater, ITE College West. One of my mentees, Haziq, also fell short of meeting the admission requirements for polytechnic. Haziq, who is 19, dreams of becoming a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter and attaining a sports science degree. But these dreams used to seem out of reach for Haziq, whose secondary school friends looked down on him and told him he would have “no future” because he went to ITE. Over the course of the five months, as I shared my similar struggles in reaching for “impossible” dreams, I could see how my story encouraged him. He grew more confident and focused, and started studying and training hard for both his academic and sporting goals, instead of letting naysayers keep him down. Even though the five months are done, I still check in on him as well as my other mentees from time to time. Haziq is now in his second year at ITE, striking a better balance between his studies and his MMA training. He aims to make it to polytechnic and, in the near future, become a professional MMA fighter. It’s been a long, hard journey to get to this point, but what I now understand is that there are multiple pathways in life. One path is not necessarily “better” than another; there are often many different roads to help you get to your desired destination or goal. Sometimes you come across an obstacle blocking the path, or even a dead end. Don’t give up; there’s always a different way forward. Personal qualities and strengths such as determination and diligence may help you succeed, but sometimes the greatest help comes from outside yourself. Mentors can be found everywhere: In your teachers, your friends, or even your managers and colleagues at work. When sign-ups opened for the second run of the DBS x ITE mentorship programme this year, I immediately submitted my name again. Ultimately, the impact of mentorship goes both ways: We can all benefit from mentors, and we can all be a mentor to someone else in need.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Upon returning to Singapore in 2016 after completing law studies, K B Ryan Joshua Mahindapala set himself a target: To move out of his parents’ home by the age of 30. This audio is AI-generated. I studied in the United Kingdom for three years in my early 20s. As a law student living by myself in a quaint, well-located apartment in the heart of the city of Liverpool, I enjoyed my independence and the fact that I no longer needed to depend on my parents. It was my idea of an ideal life. So, after I returned to Singapore in 2016, I set myself a target: By age 30, I will move out of my parents’ home and either rent a place on my own or if I were able to afford it, buy a condominium. For the next few years, I strived to work as hard as I could to become a successful lawyer so that I could achieve my dream. I completed two six-month stints at a boutique criminal and commercial dispute resolution law firm in Singapore to fulfil the on-the-job training requirements to get admitted to the Singapore Bar. After being called to the Bar in 2020, I joined a small law firm as a legal executive. A month later, I was promoted to associate and stayed in this role for two months. Throughout my three months in the firm, I worked past midnight on most days, going home for only a few hours of sleep before heading back to the office by 9am. I was also expected to work on weekends. As a result, my mental health was in shambles. I was constantly falling ill, and I would get sudden panic attacks. It was unbearable. I decided to resign. However, I was still determined to achieve my goal of living independently. Thinking I should develop other skills that could potentially help me progress in my legal career, I took part in a six-month traineeship in 2021 under the SGUnited Traineeship scheme with Boston Consulting Group (DigitalBCG Academy) to learn digital sales and marketing. I turned 30 in December 2021, when Singapore was still under tight Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. Apart from the disappointment of not being able to celebrate my “big 3-0”, several other issues dampened my mood. First, I was jobless and secondly, the skyrocketing rental costs driven by the pandemic and the significant jump in prices of private homes in 2021 weighed heavily on my mind because they dashed my hopes of moving out of my parents’ place. I was distraught but told myself to make the best out of my situation. At the start of 2022, I stepped back into the legal sector and got a job as an executive at the Law Society of Singapore. I was permitted to work remotely and spent most of my time at home. At first, it was tough. I still harboured the desire to get my own place and would occasionally look up rooms for rent on websites like PropertyGuru and Ohmyhome, hoping that I would stumble on a place that was reasonably priced and had all the qualities that I was looking for. This never happened. The harsh reality crushed my spirits and I felt like my dream had been taken away from me. I felt like a failure. One Saturday evening in December 2022, my mother approached me to say she had been tasked with co-authoring a cookbook. She wanted me to help her proofread the manuscript for spelling and grammatical errors. Her request baffled me. How and why did she get involved in such a project? What exactly was this cookbook about? My mother explained that the Peranakan Indian (Chitty Melaka) Association of Singapore (Picma), a non-profit organisation she was volunteering for, was publishing a heritage cookbook and needed help. She thought that it would be a good opportunity for me to get involved. I was reluctant to help at first because I was busy with my new job, but I eventually agreed seeing how passionate she was about the project. Reading the manuscript, entitled Heritage Food of the Peranakan Indians: In a Chitty Melaka Kitchen, I was impressed by the quality and detail of it. From a young age, I always knew that I was Peranakan Indian on my mother’s side and that the community has its own unique culture with Chinese, Malay, and Indian influences. The cuisine reflects that diversity. I used to savour the flavours of Chitty Melakan cuisine when my late maternal grandmother prepared meals for festivals such as Deepavali and Parachu. I thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food such as ayam buah keluak, lauk ikan pindang and pulut tekan as a child. However, I had never before come across a cookbook that recorded all the dishes of my community — so seeing the manuscript filled my heart with joy. In March last year, I decided to resign from my job and devote myself fully to helping my mother make the publication of the manuscript a reality. I felt that pursuing money and a career in legal practice was no longer my purpose and I wanted to do something that was more meaningful and fulfilling. I started giving private tuition to earn some income while still having a flexible schedule to work on the cookbook project. Although I was still living in my parents’ home, I no longer felt the strong desire to move out. I became drawn to my culture and heritage because of the cookbook, and I wanted to contribute in every way I could to preserve the cuisine of my community for the benefit of future generations. Living under the same roof made it possible for my mother and I to have daily discussions on how to improve the cookbook and get the project moving forward. From our conversations, I learnt that the cookbook was not merely meant to showcase the recipes of the Chitty Melakan community. It held a meaning far greater than what I had imagined. The cookbook echoed the voices of the ancestors of anyone who is of Chitty Melakan descent — voices which had gone unnoticed for centuries. No one knew who they were. They did not speak up to make themselves heard because many of them were limited by their lack of formal education which prevented them from doing so. Furthermore, they were constantly overshadowed by the more prominent, influential, and wealthy Baba Nonya (Peranakan Chinese) community. I realised that the cookbook was a platform for the community to project ourselves and share with everyone the rich and diverse cuisine, culture, and heritage of our community. It symbolised a revival of Peranakan Indian culture which my mother is very proud of. Having such conversations with my mother would have been more challenging if I had moved out. After months of painstaking rounds of discussions with fellow volunteers working on the project, proofreading, and editing, the 200-page cookbook was officially launched on Nov 19 last year. The launch was well-attended and well-received by members of both the Peranakan Indian community and other communities who were interested in learning about the culture, heritage, and cuisine of the Peranakan Indians. Having the privilege of working on the cookbook has given my life more meaning and instilled in me a sense of pride and satisfaction. I was motivated to keep going knowing that I was not just doing this for myself, but also to help preserve the rich and diverse culture and heritage of my community which dates back to the 15th century. The magnitude of the task spurred me to look past my failures, let go of the past and focus on what truly mattered in life. Living on one’s own and gaining independence might be the goal of many, and it was certainly one of my top priorities. But when things do not go our way and we do not get what we desire, we must learn to take a step back, reconnect with ourselves and be grateful for what we already have. Only then, will we be able to find a path forward. Currently, I am still living in my parents’ home. I am a full-time tuition teacher and assisting my mother and Picma with publicity of the cookbook and getting it into stores in Singapore and hopefully in other countries too. My near-term goal is to sell the remaining stock of books from the first print run and subsequently, assist in executing a second print run of 2,000 copies. As for getting my own place — well, I think it is safe to say that I will be staying put for the foreseeable future.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks Growing up, my grandfather was always bald. I watched as my father eventually lost all his hair too. \"Does having less hair make me any less of a man?\" wonders the author. This audio is AI-generated. The boy was the son of a friend, and I was teasing him good-naturedly about a girl he had a crush on. “I will tell you about my girlfriend… if you tell me about your receding hairline!” the boy shouted across the room, in front of my friends. My ears stung, and I could feel heat gently rising on my face. Sure, he was only 11, but it still hurt. A lot. As a 27-year-old in June 2023, I didn’t know how to react when faced with the stark reality of my bald spot. So I shut up. Balding was always a problem that affected the men in my family. Growing up, my grandfather was always bald; I watched as my father eventually lost all his hair too. But it wasn’t until November last year that I realised how serious my own balding issues have become. While filming a series of videos for an exchange programme, I would watch the footage back and realise that I could see the lessening hair at the crown of my forehead. Of course, there are hacks and tricks for anyone with thinning hair to try — but no matter how much I tried to do the sweepover or the ruffle-over, that persistent gap always appeared. While doing my reservist in March this year, this balding problem finally came to a head. Having to wear a helmet during training and outfield exercises means that our hair is often wet, dirty, and matted against our heads. It made my bald spot a lot more visible. By chance, I met someone who shared about his own balding journey — and how he’d decided to do something about it. He openly shared about how he got a hairpiece, and how it helped him to regain his confidence. He’d paid S$500 for his hairpiece, and he needed fortnightly treatments whereby specialists would treat his hair (not that it was really his) and patch up the glue, to ensure that it wouldn’t drop off midway during a run. You might laugh, but his hairpiece did nearly come off during an outfield exercise. He shared about other ways to deal with early onset baldness, such as thousand-dollar treatments that would remove hair follicles from the back of one’s head, where there was more hair, and move it to the bald spot at the front. That was when I finally realised how much money people were paying to get their balding problems treated. I was tempted, but the question on my mind wasn’t about money. It was this: Did having less hair make us any less of men? Every Singaporean male goes through two years of national service (NS). During my first week of NS back in May 2016, I remember a superior yelling: “We take everything away from you, so that you remember what it means to actually have something. “We take you away from your homes and put you on an island, so you remember what it means to have a home. We take away your hair and shave you botak (bald), so you remember what it means to have your dignity.” Losing one’s hair can sometimes feel like losing one’s dignity. Perhaps this sounds like an overstatement to some of us, but not to any young man losing their hair before their time. As men, this is often at the centre of our balding experiences. When you first start balding, you wonder if it’s really happening. You start looking at your forehead a lot more closely whenever you stare at the mirror. Whenever you get caught in a bit of drizzle or rain, or when you get done with a sweaty workout, you quickly ruffle your hair, hoping your bald spot isn’t showing. You become a lot more self-conscious of your hair (or lack of). It made me think: What was it about hair that made it so hard to lose? Wasn’t I botak before in the army? Part of it has to do with how I used to think I was more dashing with hair. With a growing bald spot on my head, it was difficult to imagine how I would now win a girl’s heart. But perhaps the deeper, unsaid reason that made it so difficult, was that sense of insecurity that came with losing my hair. In movies, TV shows and other popular media, we don’t often see male attractiveness ascribed to balding men. Instead, we often see it attached to men with a rich head of hair — think Patrick Dempsey in his Grey’s Anatomy heyday, or silver screen heartthrob Matthew McConaughey’s full blond curls. Balding seems to be for those who are past their prime, well on their way out of the limelight. Because of that, what made balding tough for me was how it reflected my growing age, and its accompanying failings. You stare at yourself in the mirror, and you prod your stomach. It’s flabby. You squeeze your muscles, and they feel looser. You run your head through your hair, and it’s balding. It reminds me of how, in my late twenties, life seems to offer little of the excitement that my schooling years had promised, but so much more disappointment than we’ve been prepared for. And that was perhaps the deeper question that balding asked of me: When I’d graduated from university, throwing my mortar caps with all my peers, clutching our freshly conferred degrees and ready to conquer the world, was this what I expected — to not just be losing my hair, but also losing my sense of confidence in what the world would accept me for? When I was seven years old, I would gel my hair like a curry puff, ensuring that every strand stood strong and tall. A few months into Primary 1, I had my first crush on a classmate. That afternoon, in the staid, boring classroom where the teacher droned on about addition and subtraction, I remember reaching out for the girl’s hand, and tenderly clutching it. Strangely, she didn’t push it away. I held on to her hand for the rest of the class. Looking back, that moment taught me something important about life. When we’re young, we start out with little. Parents, friends love us for who we are, and not what we bring. But somehow, along the course of life, we learn that love comes with conditions. We learn that it comes because, and not in spite of. We hide behind our achievements and temporal attractions: Our degrees, our jobs, our looks, or even our hair. It’s not till we come to the end of our lives, frail and weak, that it strikes us that as our loved ones hold our hands, it’s not our strength they are holding onto. It’s not our wealth or possessions that we cling on to. It’s the time we’ve spent together, the relationships we’ve formed, and the love we’ve shown and shared. I used to think that losing my hair would make me seem less of a man. I won’t lie, it’s still embarrassing when the light catches on my bald spot in a picture. But I’ve now realised the truth of this cliché we’ve all heard many times before — that masculinity, strength and beauty aren’t just about what’s on the outside, but what’s on the inside too. Loss will always be part of life and being human. Choosing how to face that loss and learning to stand up stronger — that is what truly determines the measure of a man.

    "article_content": "Commentary Headlines are buzzing with the excitement that the ​United States ​Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will soon designate Mounjaro to join Wegovy and Ozempic as the latest diabetes medication approved as weight loss drugs. Headlines are buzzing with the excitement that the ​United States ​Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will soon designate Mounjaro to join Wegovy and Ozempic as the latest diabetes medication approved as weight loss drugs. In Singapore, Wegovy was approved by the Health Sciences Authority earlier this year. ​ Wegovy and Ozempic can now also be prescribed for patients suffering from obesity under the discretion of a medical professional, and there have been reports of more patients requesting to be put on these drugs, despite not suffering from diabetes or being obese. As these drugs enter the market, more questions arise about safety and who exactly should be using them. These drugs have been a game changer for some people facing chronic and severe obesity who were unsuccessful in losing weight previously. I have heard the stories of countless numbers of individuals who have improved their health, beginning with a change in their mindset about their ability to make a change, followed by a programme that then helped them lose weight. No injections needed. Despite the existence of such weight loss programmes, globally, the health of many continues to decrease as their body fat continues to increase. So it’s no wonder why there is so much excitement for a medical prescription approach to weight loss. In a society that prioritises quick fixes and instant gratification, these drugs are exciting. But as a board-certified public health and preventive medicine physician, I have to ask: What is an approach that is focused on overall health and well-being that is well supported by science and is scalable for the good of the public? It remains the tried-and-true combination of regular exercise, a balanced diet and lifestyle changes. Antidiabetic drugs containing semaglutide, like Ozempic, are classed as GLP-1 agonist drugs, which are not new. They were first approved by the FDA in 2005 to treat Type-2 diabetes. They work by lowering blood sugar levels and increasing satiety — that feeling of fullness — to prevent overeating. And while loss of hunger may cause you to eat less — does it cause you to eat healthy? Our bodies still need a constant daily consumption of important macro and micro nutrients. These drugs have the potential to help people facing chronic and severe obesity who were unsuccessful in losing weight previously. However, there are potential risks and drawbacks. For instance, using them for weight loss without proper diet and exercise can result in decreased muscle density, malnutrition, cardiovascular impacts and other known issues. Most notably, the majority of patients who stop taking these drugs gain the weight back — repeating the frustrating cycle that so many people experience. Simply put, there is no silver bullet when it comes to losing weight. Sustainable weight loss is a lifelong commitment that starts with behavioral change. Long-term results happen by setting goals, being physically active, having a balanced diet, getting adequate sleep, and understanding how nutrition impacts your body. People will always need support in forming new habits and making sustainable changes — whether it’s losing weight, building muscle, or covering their nutritional needs through diet and supplements, where needed. It can be challenging to stay motivated and this is where weight loss and wellness companies can provide the support needed to help people stay on course. The positive impact of a support group was echoed by the majority (84 per cent) of consumers in a recent Herbalife Asia Pacific Health Priority Survey, which polled over 5,000 people across 11 countries, including Singapore. The respondents also said the benefits of support groups included being able to share experiences and seek guidance and encouragement. In addition, while weight loss products and supplements are not a substitute for those who need prescribed medication, they are one way to help people build the right habits that can serve them in the longer term. Without a doubt, weight loss drugs are likely here to stay, and they have the potential to improve lives and open doors to people who can truly benefit from them. But good health is more than weight loss. The ultimate goal is often more than a number on a scale — but overall improved health and a sense of well-being. To that end, an approach as a society to expand access to healthier foods, better nutrition education, a supportive community, increased norms that promote physical activity, and often a coach who can guide you on your journey remains the key elements to meet that goal.

    "article_content": "Commentary As a breast surgeon at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I see six to eight cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients every week. Breast cancer is the most common cancer afflicting women globally, with no less than one in eight women expected to develop the disease in their lifetime. As a breast surgeon at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I see six to eight cases of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients every week. But it is no less difficult to break the bad news of metastasis — or the spread of cancer — to my patients and their loved ones. It can be especially hard when it hits the young. Just recently, a colleague of mine lost his wife to breast cancer. She was a medical officer whom I had worked with, and was only in her late 30s when she passed on. My colleague now has to bring up two young children on his own. Breast cancer is the most common cancer afflicting women globally, with no less than one in eight women expected to develop the disease in their lifetime. Although more commonly diagnosed in women aged 50 years or older, the global incidence of breast cancer in younger women has risen by 16 per cent since the 1990s and is currently the most common cancer in young women, with 244,000 cases diagnosed per year. Fortunately, the survival rate of breast cancer has improved dramatically for most patients now due to the advancement of diagnostic and pathology assessment tools, surgical techniques, radiation precision, and new systemic treatment options for patients. The key, however, still lies in the early detection and prevention of invasive breast cancer. If the disease is detected in its early stages, we can often perform breast-conserving surgery and even avoid chemotherapy. Singapore has established a national breast cancer screening programme since 2002, where women 50 years and above are invited to attend breast cancer screening biannually at a subsidised rate of S$50. Women aged 40 to 49 years can also attend screening annually after discussion with their doctors regarding the benefits and limitations. With the recent introduction of Healthier SG, breast cancer screening will be fully subsidised and free of charge for eligible women in the near future. Despite these measures, however, what is worrying is that our national take-up rate for breast cancer screening is low. Statistics from the National Population Health Survey show that it was about 40 per cent in 2019, a stark contrast to other developed nations like the United States and Sweden, which had take-up rates of 80-90 per cent in the same year. In the latest available statistics in 2021, our overall breast cancer screening participation further dropped to 31.1 per cent, but this may be partially influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic and deferment of less urgent health services such as screening. Local researchers have attempted to shed light on this phenomenon of low screening uptake, which is especially perplexing for a highly-educated nation like ours. Four key themes were revealed from a local research conducted by a team from the Health Promotion Board, published in the Annals Academy of Medicine Singapore: I remember a patient called Madam Tan, a single mother in her early 50s who confessed that she did not attend screenings because she was the sole breadwinner and was too busy with work to provide for her two children, one of whom just recently enrolled in a university. She was presented with locally advanced breast cancer which required urgent chemotherapy to control the further spread of the disease and shrink her cancer before surgery. However, she was worried about the effects of chemotherapy, which would affect her ability to work. She decided to delay treatment and seek help from alternative medicine instead, despite our repeated attempts advising her against doing so. Some months later, she was readmitted to the emergency department for vomiting and weakness. Unfortunately, her disease had progressed to Stage 4 and spread to her brain. She passed on peacefully shortly after, in the company of her loved ones. Madam Tan should be the exception and not the norm, but unfortunately, cases like hers are not uncommon in my practice. Her death is a reminder of the importance of attending regular breast cancer screenings and highlights the struggles that the women in our society face — juggling the pressures of providing for the family and taking care of one’s health. Sadly, personal health often takes the backseat and gets neglected in the daily grind. Another important lesson gleaned from Madam Tan’s case is to educate our youths on significant healthcare issues that plague our society today. Studies have shown that women are more likely to attend screening when they are encouraged and supported by their children. This will become increasingly important with our low fertility rate and increasing life expectancy. The youths of today must be more involved in supporting our ageing society. Recently, I had the privilege of mentoring a group of university students who are passionate about raising breast cancer screening uptake in Singapore. The team, “Mammobot”, aims to develop a chatbot which can be deployed over mobile and web-hosted platforms to educate the public on the importance of breast cancer screening, answer common questions pertaining to screening and provide a follow-up function to send mammogram screening appointment reminders. Team Mammobot won the “Social Responsibility Award” with their prototype in this year’s Medical Innovation Grand Challenge organised by the National University of Singapore. The team has decided to use the prize money to further develop the prototype to benefit the public in the near future. Next month (October) marks the start of Breast Cancer Awareness month here and internationally. Various locations in Singapore will be lit up in pink in support, and a series of public campaigns and events will be held across our island. I am proud to say that Yishun Health and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital where I work will be part of these efforts in collaboration with Tzu Chi Foundation. In addition to multi-lingual public education seminars on breast cancer and Healthier SG, we will organise sharing sessions by patient advocates on their personal breast cancer journeys. A Mammobus will also be deployed to facilitate screenings on-site. As the event’s organising committee Chairman, I am very fortunate to be given the opportunity to put together an event to raise awareness for such a worthy cause. Just as heartening is the support I have received from medical and nursing students from our local universities. I believe that involving the youth of today in tackling national healthcare problems will reap benefits for society down the road. Screening and prevention of breast cancer is one of the nation’s focus under the Healthier SG strategy and we can certainly benefit from the additional creative energy of our younger generation, as part of an “all hands on deck battle” against this formidable disease.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — Slightly over a quarter of Singapore residents aged 18 to 29 suffered from poor mental health last year, a national survey has found. SINGAPORE — Slightly over a quarter of Singapore residents aged 18 to 29 suffered from poor mental health last year, a national survey has found. This group of youth made up the highest proportion of residents who faced mental health issues compared to other age groups, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on releasing its findings from the 2022 National Population Health Survey on Wednesday (Sept 27). The proportion of young people dealing with mental health issues in 2022 — 25.3 per cent — was an increase from the 21.5 per cent in 2020. In comparison, the prevalence of poor mental health in those aged 30 to 39 was 19.4 per cent last year, a rise from 12.6 per cent in 2020. For those aged 40 to 49, the proportion was 15.7 per cent, up from 12.4 per cent in 2020. Overall, 17 per cent of Singapore residents faced mental health issues last year, up from 13.4 per cent in 2020. However, more people were also willing to seek informal help — such as from friends, relatives or religious leaders — when they were unable to cope with stress, the study found. MOH's survey tracked the health and risk factors, as well as lifestyle practices of Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 between July 2021 to June 2022. As part of the study, about 8,000 residents completed household interviews and around 9,000 attended a health examination. The increase in \"help-seeking behaviour\" displayed by Singapore residents in response to stress \"reflects continued public awareness of mental health, and reduced stigma around mental health conditions\", MOH said on Wednesday. The study found that more people on the whole were willing to seek help informally from their social circle (79.7 per cent) than from healthcare professionals (56.6 per cent) if they were constantly unable to cope with stress. Informal support networks include friends, relatives and teachers, while healthcare professionals include counsellors and psychologists. However, the proportion of residents who were willing to seek informal help decreased with age, the study found. The 18-to-29 age group was the most willing (88.1 per cent) to seek help informally. Older adults aged 60 to 74 were the least willing, with 68.4 per cent saying they would seek help. As for seeking help from healthcare professionals, 60.1 per cent of those aged 18 to 29 said that they would do so. This was even lower (48.1 per cent) among older adults aged 60 to 74. Those aged 30 to 39 years (62.0 per cent) were the most willing to do so. Females were also more willing to seek help from healthcare professionals and informal support networks compared to males, the study found. In a separate survey by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), the findings revealed some unhealthy dietary trends among residents last year. These included rises in sodium intake and calorie consumption among Singapore residents. HPB's 2022 National Nutrition Survey monitored the dietary patterns and nutritional status of 3,000 Singapore residents aged 18 to 69 from December 2021 to August 2022. Although this National Nutrition Survey found that sugar consumption had declined since 2018, sodium intake remained high. The daily sodium intake of the population increased from 3,480mg in 2019 to 3,620mg in 2022. Nine in 10 Singapore residents exceeded the daily recommended sodium intake of less than 2,000mg, which is equivalent to one teaspoon of salt. This was a slight rise from 88 per cent in the last study done in 2019. A key source of sodium consumption is the salt and sauces added during cooking, as well as in meals eaten outside of home, HPB said. Soupy dishes were the main source of sodium, followed by convenience foods and gravy or sauce-based dishes. HPB added that on average, sodium content for every dish sold outside has increased by 22 per cent from 2010 to 2023. This was due to increases in portion size and price increases for ingredients. This causes food operators to turn to salt — a cheaper alternative — to maintain flavour. To address this trend, HPB had in September last year announced targets to get the population here to reduce sodium intake by 15 per cent in the next five years. It also said then that it will make healthier salt and seasoning products more readily available to consumers, such as potassium salt that contains about half the amount of sodium compared to regular table salt. Although the National Population Health Survey showed that there was a decreasing prevalence of diabetes and high cholesterol among Singapore residents, the prevalence of hypertension continues to rise. Just 19.8 per cent of residents suffered from hypertension in 2010, but this figure rose to 35.5 per cent in the 2019-2020 study and 37 per cent in the 2021-2022 edition, MOH said. A diet high in sodium is a significant risk factor for hypertension, MOH and HPB said. Every 1g increase in salt intake a day is associated with a nearly 10 per cent increase in hypertension risk, HPB said during a media briefing on Monday ahead of the release of its survey results. The HPB's nutrition survey also found that people are eating more, with the average calorie intake increasing from 2,360kcal in 2019 to 2,410kcal in 2022. More than half, or 61 per cent of the population, are exceeding their daily recommended calorie intake after factoring the energy required for physical activity. This is compared to 55 per cent in 2019. The main sources of excessive calorie intake include fried foods and flavoured rice, HPB said. Despite the increase in calorie intake, MOH's National Population Health Survey found that fewer people were engaging in sufficient physical activity, with only 74.9 per cent doing so compared to 84.6 per cent in 2019. This is likely due to the reduced commuting from hybrid work arrangements, which has not yet returned to levels before the Covid-19 pandemic, MOH said. The World Health Organization's physical activity guidelines stipulate that every week, people should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or an equivalent of moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity. Although the overall prevalence of binge drinking was trending downwards between 2019 and 2022, the drop was not significant. It went down from 9.6 per cent in 2021 to 9.4 per cent in 2022. Males aged 40 to 49 and females aged 30 to 39 were the highest proportion of binge drinkers at 16.9 per cent and 9 per cent respectively, the population health survey found.

As a night owl, I often marvel at how I created this morning lark. NEW YORK — My older child has always been an early riser. He rarely snoozes past 6am and wakes up with enthusiasm. As a night owl, I often marvel at how I created this morning lark. “Everybody’s ‘clock’ is set a little differently,” said Dr Leisha Cuddihy, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester’s Comprehensive Sleep Center. Here are some expert tips that can help mornings feel more tolerable, and even productive. LOCK IN YOUR WAKE TIME. To shift your sleep schedule, the trick is to set a consistent wake time, and stick to it every day, said Dr Rafael Pelayo, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences in sleep medicine at Stanford Medicine. It takes about a week for your body to adjust for every hour you move up your wake time, he added. ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR NATURE. Even if you are an early riser, you may not wake up ready to start the day. “A lot of people, no matter what time they wake up, just need a minute,” Dr Cuddihy said. Acknowledging that can help bring peace to the morning, she said. Find ways to protect quiet time: Sit in bed and take a few deep breaths. Couple it with a strategy known to increase wakefulness, like soaking up some sunlight. REWARD YOURSELF — IMMEDIATELY. People tend to change habits when doing so feels relatively easy and rewarding, said Dr Wendy Wood, a professor of psychology and business at the University of Southern California. So if your goal is to wake up earlier — or to mitigate early morning grouchiness — it is essential to build in immediate rewards. Consider what would feel good after you wake up. Maybe it’s a delicious breakfast or playing music you love. TURN ROUTINES INTO MEANINGFUL RITUALS. “When you shift something from a routine into a ritual, it makes it more special,” said Dr Cassie Mogilner Holmes, author of “Happier Hour: How to Beat Distraction, Expand Your Time and Focus on What Matters Most.” Focus on something you already do every day, like having a morning cup of coffee. Label it your “coffee ritual,” Dr Holmes said. Notice, with wonder, what it feels like to go through each step. Use a special mug or enjoy a particularly delicious brew. “All of a sudden, it puts you in a different frame of mind,” Dr Holmes said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times .

    "article_content": "Singapore The first time I walked in on my nephew chasing the family’s pet cat around the house, my first reaction was to tell him not to do that. The first time I walked in on my nephew chasing the family’s pet cat around the house, my first reaction was to tell him not to do that. Given a talking-to for “disturbing” the cat, he stopped but went back to doing the same after a while. Around five or six years old at the time, he had seemed oblivious to the cat’s distress. The cat, being swift and nimble, was not harmed, although my nephew got scratched once. Was he being mischievous and curious about how the cat would react to his chasing? Or was his behaviour suggestive of something more concerning? Was I right in trying to discipline him? I did not think that my nephew had malicious intent, but I could not help my own nagging feeling: When children behave in an unruly manner towards animals, when should the adults in their lives worry? In the last few years, there have been cases of animal cruelty by children and youth that made the news. Among these was a 10-year-old boy who threw a community cat off a public housing block. The cat died. In a separate case, a 19-year-old, who pleaded guilty and was given a community sentence for several offences such as trespassing a rhino enclosure at the Singapore Zoo and killing a live frog on a foosball table. In April this year, a teenaged boy was arrested for committing an obscene act on a cat . Figures by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) showed that the number of animal welfare and cruelty cases was at its highest last year since 2020. In total, there were 481 cases in 2020, 324 in 2021 and 511 last year. In the same period, there was a seven-fold increase in the number of cases involving child and youth animal abusers. Of the total cases reported, there was one case each in 2020 and 2021 that involved youth (under the age of 21), but there were seven such cases last year. SPCA said that the numbers reflect cases that had enough evidence of animal abuse and exclude suspected cases with inconclusive evidence. The absolute number of cases involving a child or teenager may seem low, but Ms Aarthi Sankar, executive director of SPCA, said that “a single case is arguably one too many, especially among this young age group”. She observed that the common ways in which animal abuse was carried out included: Acts of animal cruelty and abuse are never acceptable no matter the perpetrator’s age. However, I cannot help but wonder if such cases could have been prevented if the adults in these young people’s lives had stepped in earlier to intervene. At the same time, I was also appalled by the intense public vitriol and threats against some of the young culprits. For example, online users called for the 10-year-old to be taught a similar painful lesson and to be jailed, with some threatening to throw him off the building. How helpful would retributive justice be in addressing the complex psycho-social aspects involved in children who commit such acts? Mental health experts I spoke to said that any incident of animal maltreatment by children must always be addressed and not waved off as child’s play or curiosity. However, they also pointed out that reacting to the child’s wrongdoing in anger, or physically punishing or intimidating the child would be counterproductive and may even perpetuate the circle of violence. Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist from Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, said: “Parents should always be concerned when they observe their children mistreating animals. It might be indicative of underlying emotional distress and maybe a reflection of the child’s difficult or abusive environment. He added: “Addressing the incident allow for an opportunity to educate the child (to understand) right from wrong in the very least. “Leaving the incidents alone is detrimental to the child and may result in the behaviours escalating.” To find effective ways to correct the behaviour, it is helpful to first understand the child’s or youth’s motivations or triggers. In children, the motivation to hurt an animal typically differs from that of adult animal abusers, Dr Lim said. In adults, the most common reason for animal cruelty is anger, and this is often rooted in power dynamics, a history of violence or even psychopathy. Children, however, may not know right from wrong, and may externalise their negative emotions and act out on their pets or animals they see, he said. Besides curiosity or exploration, a child’s motivations for animal cruelty may include peer pressure, to relieve boredom or when coerced to do so by a more powerful individual (for example, an adult in the child’s life). Some children may have animal phobia, and pre-emptively attack the animal they fear, Dr Lim suggested. Dr Cherie Chan, a clinical psychologist with The Other Clinic, a private practice, said that it is important to distinguish between the types of cruelty to determine how best to intervene. For example, is there deliberate intention to hurt the animal or is it a case of neglect such as forgetting to feed the pet? “Educating the child on the importance of relating and respecting living relationships could help reduce neglectful behaviours,\" she said. “For deliberate acts of cruelty, it may be helpful to talk about why it occurred and to understand if there are associations in the home or school environment that may have encouraged the display of aggression.” When asked how to tell the difference between a child’s curiosity and intentional abuse, Ms Sankar from SPCA said that there are several considerations: The type of action, how long it has been going on, intention and the child’s response to signs of distress from the animals. “For the type of action, there is a clear difference between a child who pokes a cat’s belly with a finger to elicit a reaction, and a child who tries to drive a pair of scissors into the cat’s belly.” Certain tools, such as a pair of scissors, are almost always used to cause destruction, she said. “Children who have been exposed to these implements, such as in school, can reasonably be expected to know the dangers of using them and hence understand the injury they can inflict. This knowledge increases their culpability beyond mere curiosity,” she added. A child who repeats the action, especially if the animal shows distress, is also more likely to be intentionally cruel than curious. “However, this is based on the assumption that the child can accurately read the body language of the animal. “The ability to read such cues tends to be lower among young children and children with certain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder,” Ms Sankar added. These would be those that cover topics such as animal welfare and responsible pet ownership. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) offers youth engagement programmes such as the Youth Ambassador Programme for children aged seven to 16. There is also an upcoming youth animal welfare symposium in October to allow those above the age of 16 to engage in meaningful discussions surrounding animal welfare advocacy issues. Check out resources from the National Parks Board (NParks) and the Animal and Veterinary Service on responsible pet care. These can be found on NParks' website and YouTube channel as well as the AnimalBuzzSG Facebook page. Other child-friendly online resources suggested by SPCA include the websites of National Geographic Kids website and the World Wildlife Fund. Building awareness and knowledge through resources should be accompanied by practical experiences that inspire empathy and compassion, SPCA’s executive director Aarthi Sankar said. For example, parents may arrange for guided interactions where the child is guided to interact appropriately with an animal. During these sessions, parents or an informed adult may explain how to read an animal’s body language and respond in a way that is respectful of the animal’s needs and preferences. In daily conversations, Ms Sankar suggested that parents may highlight the similarities between animals and humans so that their child begins to appreciate that animals are sentient beings who also feel pain and emotions. SPCA, for example, has had two runs of an event where through the use of technology, the public is invited to feel what it is like to be an animal that is under distress. Dr Lim said that studies show a higher prevalence of animal cruelty in children with developmental delays, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder. He once encountered a primary school boy with ADHD whose impulsive behaviour and hyperactivity affected the way he treated his pet dog. His parents were often frustrated with his behaviour and would physically punish him. “When the boy became frustrated, especially after a run-in with his parents, he would often lash out at the dog, pulling its tail, hitting or screaming at it,” Dr Lim said. The boy and his parents were referred to a child psychologist to work through the behavioural issues. Medications were given to help manage the boy’s impulsivity and hyperactivity. The parents were also taught to manage their child’s behaviour with positive parenting techniques. Over time, the child developed a healthier relationship with his pet and the abusive behaviour stopped, Dr Lim said. “This case illustrates the complex interplay between a mental health issue, parenting difficulties and animal abuse. “The boy’s behaviour was unacceptable but it was rooted in his struggle with ADHD and his parents inability to cope with his ADHD behaviour.” With the right support and intervention, such situations can improve, he added. “This emphasises the importance of understanding and address the underlying issues.” In some cases, animal abuse by a child could also be a sign for child abuse or exposure to domestic violence. While younger children may act out of curiosity, Dr Lim said that animal abuse carried out by older children who are above 10 years old is associated with child abuse, with these children being two or three times more likely to have been directly abused themselves. “They have also often witnessed family violence, including that of violence towards their pets by family members. “One study has shown that about a third (32 per cent) of children exposed to domestic violence go on to engage in animal abuse,” he said. “It is likely that these children are desensitised to violence or are modelling the adults in their lives. “Moreover, children who feel disempowered in their personal lives might harm animals to exert control or gain a sense of power,” Dr Lim added. Dr Chan the clinical psychologist agreed. When asked what could possibly be the motivation behind a young person’s disturbing behaviour, she said that acts of animal cruelty could possibly stem from curiosity as well as experiences of violence or abuse in the child’s personal life. “There is a possibility that individuals who engage in behaviour (that includes performing obscene acts) may be objectifying animals and fail to feel empathy or emotions towards a ‘less powerful’ (living thing),” Dr Chan added. In changing the behaviour of a young animal abuser, the mental health experts said that the focus should not be to lay blame on the child alone, and that a more compassionate approach may be more appropriate. “The focus should be on rehabilitation and understanding, not retribution. “Rehabilitative programmes, if well-structured and comprehensive, can be effective in altering the child’s behaviour,” Dr Lim said. On the other hand, public condemnation is likely to be more harmful and unhelpful: Threatening or harming the child can reinforce their negative views on adults and society in general, further traumatising the child and worsening their behaviour, he added. Physically punishing the child may halt the behaviour temporarily, but it does not address the root causes, be it impulse control difficulties or family violence. Fostering empathy, encouraging open communication and understanding the child’s feelings and motivations, as well as their environment, would be more effective in bringing about long-lasting change, Dr Lim advised. In the case of the 10-year-old boy who threw the cat off a housing block for instance, he was placed on a “diversionary programme” conducted by the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS), after being assessed by a psychiatrist not to have attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of his conduct and taking his age into account. Ms Jessica Kwok, group director of AVS, said that the diversionary programme was assessed to be the most appropriate course of action in this case because the programme centres on rehabilitation, by getting the offender to understand animal welfare, how to care for animals, living with animals in the community, and why his actions were wrong. After completing the one-month programme, the boy expressed regret and remorse over his actions, and apologised to the cat’s caregivers. He was issued a stern warning from AVS, which will continue to work with his school to monitor his progress. Ms Kwok said that this programme has been conducted before for offenders, with the curriculum of each programme tailored to the profile of the offender. Ms Sankar said that continued support and guidance are pivotal in preventing youth from repeating such actions. In the case of the 10-year-old boy above, for example, SPCA recommends regular follow-ups involving both the parent and the child on a quarterly basis to ensure that a robust support system is in place for the youth's rehabilitation. Collaborative efforts among the school, family and the authorities are essential in ensuring a comprehensive approach. “In addition, we encourage vigilant neighbours to report any suspected animal abuse to the authorities or SPCA. “By working together as a community, we can take necessary steps to prevent such tragedies from recurring,” Ms Sankar said. Dr Lim stressed that it is crucial for parents and family to be involved in correcting abusive behaviour. Parenting training — that is focused on positive parenting and limit setting aimed at helping children develop empathy — has been shown to be effective at improving anti-social behaviours such as animal abuse, he said. In children, limit setting refers to the process where caregivers establish and communicate boundaries, rules and expectations to guide the child’s behaviour. It helps children understand what behaviours are acceptable and what are not, Dr Lim explained. My nephew, now 10, is older and better able to rein in his impulsive behaviour. When we asked why he was chasing the cat around, he said that he had just wanted to play with it. Still, we felt it was important to educate him on how to interact with animals. We explained how his actions were stressing the cat. He has since learnt more appropriate ways to interact with it, for example, by gently stroking it on the head instead of touching areas such as the tail. Recently, he worriedly informed me that the cat appeared to be having flu symptoms, and asked that I take it to a clinic for a check-up. Looking at his concerned face, I was relieved that he was showing concern for his pet.

    "article_content": "World PARIS — Despite claims that the fashion industry is embracing curvier bodies, the data suggests it could be guilty of what one expert calls \"fat-washing\". One study found only 0.6 per cent of models in the major fashion weeks were plus-size last season. PARIS — Despite claims that the fashion industry is embracing curvier bodies, the data suggests it could be guilty of what one expert calls \"fat-washing\". While a handful of plus-size models such as Paloma Elsesser have grabbed media attention in recent years, the figures show they remain a vanishingly small minority. Vogue Business looked at 9,137 outfits unveiled during 219 shows in New York, London, Milan and Paris last season and found that 0.6 per cent were plus-size — defined as US size 14 or above, which is actually the average size for a woman in the United States — and only 3.8 per cent were size 6 to 12. This means 95.6 per cent of outfits presented were in US sizes 0 to 4. Dr Paolo Volonte, who teaches sociology of fashion in Milan, says brands use a few curvy models to deflect criticism. \"It's 'fat-washing',\" he told AFP, comparing it to criticisms of cynical \"green-washing\" by which the industry is accused of making empty climate pledges. \"They use curvy models in their shows to show inclusivity but in fact, this is to preserve and maintain a system based on the tyranny of the thin ideal,\" Dr Volonte said. Ms Ekaterina Ozhiganova, a 31-year-old model and law student, says luxury brands simply \"refuse to represent normal people\". Medium-sized women \"are often told either to lose weight... or to push themselves up to XL,\" she told AFP. \"Neither is healthy.\" Ms Ozhiganova's advocacy group, Model Law, carried out a survey that found nine out of 10 models felt pressure to change their bodies, more than half on a regular basis. \"It's very hard for them to talk about,\" she said. \"If you complain, everyone will just say: 'Darling, that's the job.'\" How it became \"the job\" is a question of history. Dr Volonte says the obsession with thinness dates back to the birth of industrial production techniques. Previously, designers made clothes specific to individuals. In the mass production era, they use small templates which they scale up for larger sizes. This only works up to a certain size, however, after which fat and muscle can change the shape of bodies in more complex ways. \"It is much more expensive to produce and sell clothing in higher sizes and requires more expertise,\" said Dr Volonte. At the same time, thinness became firmly associated with wealth — having the time and money to work on your body — an aspiration that has been deeply entrenched by advertising and the day-to-day practices of the fashion industry. There have been efforts to change things since the early 2000s when fears spread that size-zero models were encouraging anorexia in young people. Since 2017, France has required models to pass medical examinations, while the country's two biggest luxury conglomerates, LVMH and Kering, signed charters vowing to stop using size-zero models. But with sizes varying from one brand to the next, this is hard to enforce. Designers are as trapped in the status quo as everyone else. Elite couturier Mohammad Ashi says discrimination based on race and gender has been fairly well tackled in fashion, but shape is tricky. \"We're not trying to avoid it, but from an industrial point of view, we can't produce a plus-size dress. We sell what we show and I know our clients personally. It's just business,\" he told AFP. Couturier Julien Fournie has used pregnant models and his favourite model, Michaela Tomanova, has \"six centimetres everywhere more than the others\". But he says, \"fashion remains fashion... It's a fantasy world and that will never change fundamentally.\" AFP Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — A new specialised care facility will be piloted to support youth who are at risk of suicide, the Government said. SINGAPORE — A new specialised care facility will be piloted to support youth who are at risk of suicide, the Government said. This was announced on Thursday (Oct 5) during the launch of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, which aims to build up the country’s mental health ecosystem to offer accessible clinical care to people who need it. For young persons with suicide risk, not all have mental health conditions, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in releasing a 49-page report of the national strategy. On average each year, 650 people aged 10 to 19 with suicide risk are admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and at least half of these do not suffer from any mental health conditions. Instead, triggers are usually related to stressors such as difficult interpersonal relationships with family, peers or romantic partners. After they are discharged from IMH, some of these young people might be re-admitted because they find it hard to cope with their living environment. “An intermediate residential facility will be piloted for this group of youths to stabilise them in a safe and nurturing environment, while providing psycho-social interventions to address underlying triggers before discharge,” the ministries said in a news release. MOH and MSF are co-leading the Inter-agency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, formed in July 2021 to oversee and coordinate mental health efforts across various public sector agencies. The task force, which developed the national strategy, is chaired by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Health and for Communications and Information. He said on Thursday at a press conference: “What we want to do is to improve the mental health support ecosystem here... where people live in a caring and inclusive society, seek help without stigma and are ready to support one another.” The plan is to also avoid unwarranted medicalising when it comes to treatments and to reduce the stigma around mental health , the task force said in the report. The intermediate facility for young people who are at risk of suicide is envisioned to be a rehabilitation centre where they may seek refuge free of stigma in a safe environment for short periods of time, or up to six months. This is a live-in facility where a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, live-in staff members and nurses attend to them to address underlying triggers before they are discharged. Details on payment methods and insurance coverage, the facility's capacity as well as its location are still in the works. To better support parents in helping to manage their children’s mental health, a “toolbox” is being developed to empower and equip them with personalised knowledge and skills to build strong parent-child relationships and to strengthen their children’s mental well-being and resilience. This resource kit is expected to be launched early next year, and it is suitable for households that might not fit into the typical nuclear family structure. MSF said at a media briefing: “Strategies in the toolbox are practical in nature and (therefore), any profile of family should be able to use it.” It added that the toolkit is “not your typical, very dense, structured parenting programme”. “These are evidence-based strategies taken from research such that diverse kinds of profiles would find the strategies easy to use on a day-to-day basis.” The toolkit also serves to combat any stigma parents might have against mental health conditions , with information on mental health literacy, children’s mental well-being and tips on how to detect early signs of distress in children. A recent national health survey found that the highest proportion of people with poor mental health were from the 18 to 29 age group. That is why the task force is looking to scale up ongoing efforts to build mental and socio-emotional resilience in the young by introducing emotional development lessons in preschools. This is led by the Early Childhood Development Agency, which will make available resources and training for early childhood educators. As for improving mental health literacy and reducing stigma, some of the initiatives detailed in the national strategy report include: These efforts will be expanded and targeted at children aged seven years and above. Even though social media has always been a double-edged sword when it comes to emotional and mental health, the task force recognises that outright banning of social media usage is not ideal either. The Ministry of Education (MOE) said: “We are unlikely to go the way of China when it comes to young people owning personal devices.” It was referring to the Cyberspace Administration of China proposing rules that will see people under 18 banned from accessing the internet on mobile devices from 10pm to 6am. Different age groups will be allowed certain durations a day to use their phones, for example. As part of MOE's 2030 masterplan to develop digitally literate learners, secondary school students have their own personal learning devices such as iPads. MOE has so far strengthened cyber wellness education in schools and institutes of higher learning by training and nurturing students to be discerning, safe, respectful and responsible users in cyberspace. The young are also taught the importance of respect and empathy, how to protect themselves and others online, and how to seek help when necessary. HPB also provides cyber-wellness tips on MindSG, a one-stop online portal with mental health resources, targeted at teenagers and youth. MOE recognised that although there are many negative aspects to social media usage for young people, many of them also use it as a tool for learning. Parents play a critical role in guiding their children as they navigate the digital world and so, they will find that the upcoming toolkit mentioned earlier will help them understand the digital landscape and empower them to support their children. A “positive use” guide on technology and social media will also be introduced to show how technology and social media can contribute to or hinder youth developmental processes. “It's a very fine balance, but we can't tell them not to use it. We prefer to teach them how to use it,” MOE said. The full report of the national strategy is available on MOH’s website .

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — As someone who has had depression since the age of 15, Raven (who did not want to be identified by her real name) would not have minded staying in a dedicated facility for youth prone to suicide risk or self-harm. SINGAPORE — As someone who has had depression since the age of 15, Raven (who did not want to be identified by her real name) would not have minded staying in a dedicated facility for youth prone to suicide risk or self-harm . This would have provided a respite from home, where she often felt very isolated, exacerbating her depression. She added that with round-the-clock care and a good in-patient programme provided at such a place, it would have definitely speeded up her recovery as well. Now 27, she was commenting after it was announced on Thursday (Oct 5) that such a facility catered to the youth is being planned as part of the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy to improve mental healthcare for various segments of the population here. Many details are still in the works, but the goal is for this intermediary care centre to serve as a rehabilitation centre where young people may seek refuge, free of stigma , in a safe environment for up to six months. This is a live-in facility where a team of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, live-in staff members and nurses attend to youth with suicide risk who have received primary care, in order to address underlying triggers before they get home. Raven said that having a home away from home would be really helpful, especially if young people do not have access to other mental healthcare. However, she and some other young people, as well as mental health practitioners, told TODAY that they do have certain concerns about how such a place would be run and how it will ensure that the patients return to leading a normal life. Mr Ian, 27, who did not want to give his full name and is diagnosed with panic disorder, said that a care facility that promises a safe and stigma-free zone is beneficial for youth to develop some clarity on why they are feeling troubled. Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder where people regularly have sudden attacks of panic or fear. Even though people can experience general anxiety or panic during stressful moments, people with panic disorder have frequent and unexpected panic attacks and spend long periods in constant fear of another attack. “I didn't fully understand what triggered my anxiety as soon as I was diagnosed, so to be in a facility with a team of professionals at the ready to immediately help you with what is troubling you, that would have been very beneficial and insightful,” the freelance creative director added. He observed that at a young age, people often lack the vocabulary to articulate what they are going through, so to get a grasp on it and develop some understanding of their condition would be useful. “I know at 20, I didn't have the verbiage or the understanding of the world to comprehend what was causing me to be suicidal.” As for 22-year-old Ashely Poo, a polytechnic student who is diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety, she said: “I think it’s a great initiative for youths to have a safe space, especially when home isn’t one.” Like Raven, she also said that being at home can be “triggering” because it intensifies feelings of isolation and can exacerbate mental illness. Raven said: “If it is presented as an easily accessible option for teenagers, I do think it's a great thing, because seeking avenues for help was something I struggled with as a teenager.” Dr Jonathan Kuek, a mental health advocate, is co-founder of The Total Wellness Initiative Singapore, which seeks to encourage people to be more proactive with their well-being. He said that having a facility like this is “a fantastic idea”. He believes that the concept would be similar to crisis houses overseas, where care is provided in a residential setting instead of an overtly medical one such as a hospital. They offer intensive, short-term support to help people manage mental health crises. “A shift to rehabilitation means there can be a greater focus on more well-rounded care that targets the psychosocial and emotional challenges that youths may be facing, instead of a greater focus on managing the risk of harm and symptoms,” Dr Kuek added. This move away from a hospital setting is vital for young people who might feel intimidated and hesitant to be admitted to one, a counsellor said. Mr Thum Berfont, a senior rehabilitation counsellor from Anglican Care Centre (Pasir Ris), a non-profit organisation that offers counselling sessions, said: “The mixed profile of patients held in the general ward (in terms of age and diagnosis) could make the environment more challenging for youths who are grappling with acute stressors.” He also said that being in the mixed environment of a psychiatric hospital with a range of patients consisting of adults undergoing mental health relapses can be intimidating and stressful for younger patients. “It's important to recognise that the approach required for managing acute stress reactions differs from the one used for chronic mental health conditions or relapses.” These sentiments were shared by freelance creative director Ian, who was admitted to the Institute of Mental Health when he was 20, and he described the experience as “overwhelming”. As a young person having a mental health crisis, facing a new strict daily routine with designated mealtimes as part of his in-patient programme, no access to the outdoors, unfamiliar faces around him, and coping with a new environment can be disorientating. “I wanted someone to sit me down and take as much time as I needed to really comprehend what I was going through,” he recalled. “I hope that this facility gives space to the young, that they are given the attention they need for the length of time that they require.” Having espoused the good of having an alternative healing space, the interviewees and the experts said that a facility of this sort will still not do much to eradicate the stigma associated with mental health . It might even draw undue attention to suicide and its associated pains and repercussions, making youth-at-risk even more uncomfortable to step forward and seek help. “I think it's a double-edged sword, honestly,” Raven said, “as suicide risk is still a pretty serious issue, so I think having a programme dedicated to just that could be quite alienating since it singles out (those with suicide risk).” To add to that, Ms Poo said that there is a fear of people finding out that you were admitted to such a facility. She also wondered if a stay in such a place would be reflected on official records and affect employment, for example. Ms Ling Anne Hsieh, one of the founders of Project Green Ribbon, said that the facility is a “good option” to have but could be seen as a mere band-aid to the root cause of a troubled mind. Project Green Ribbon is a non-profit organisation that takes in youth in crisis and provides refuge and support for them as they go through a transition and reintegrate into society. Ms Ling also said: “Most of the time, when (young people) are having such troubles, a lot of it stems from childhood. Much of it stems from broken families, or even intact families but just dysfunctional.” The focus should be on preventive and early care, she suggested. Ms Ling believes that it would be hard to run away from the stigma that comes along with having to seek treatment for suicidal leanings, so the facility's name and positioning must be a “careful” process because “every label that we put will give a certain image”. Agreeing with Ms Ling, Dr Kuek said: “The devil’s in the details when it comes to execution.” He added: “There is a real possibility that despite the best efforts of the facility, the root causes of (what the person is dealing with) may not be solved through their stay, and a strong continuity and community of care is necessary as well. “If this is not done well and intentionally, it may lose its potential effectiveness.” Most of the interviewees brought up the matter of the healthcare costs of staying at such a care centre. “Even for working adults, affording mental healthcare can be too costly, so I do hope it's a programme that's heavily subsidised or even free for teenagers,” Raven said. Furthermore, it is unclear now how the stay would work around school and studies such that the residents do not fall too far behind the curriculum. And looking at the capacity of the facility, Dr Kuek foresees that there will almost certainly be more people needing admission than there are spaces available, especially given that it will be the first of its kind. “Identifying and selecting who gets to be placed in it will be tricky, and what happens after they leave will be an issue,” he said. This is because, despite best efforts, the source of mental distress may not be solved through their stay. Equal emphasis needs to be placed on the continuity of care after their stint at the facility, be it follow-ups from counsellors or community services. Dr Kuek warned, though, that this might then weigh heavy on manpower resources. “With all these questions and concerns taken together, it is uncertain how many youths will be able to benefit from such an approach given its proposed initial scale,” he added.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — Undergraduate Genevieve Tiong has spent the past seven years grappling with a digestive system that causes her to endure unbearable stomach pain, bloody stools and severe diarrhoea. Miss Genevieve Tiong (pictured) said that. having inflammatory bowel disease wore her down a lot and she hopes to gradually return to normal activities. SINGAPORE — Undergraduate Genevieve Tiong has spent the past seven years grappling with a digestive system that causes her to endure unbearable stomach pain, bloody stools and severe diarrhoea. Diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, one of the main types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the 23-year-old told of how her life has been derailed due to the debilitating condition. IBD is characterised by chronic swelling of the digestive tract, and can disrupt the body’s ability to digest food, absorb nutrition and eliminate waste properly. Crohn’s disease can affect the digestive tract at any part, from the mouth to the anus, and the last part of the small intestine, which comprises the colon and area around the anus, is the most commonly affected. Ulcerative colitis, the other main IBD, causes inflammation and ulcers in the inner lining of the large intestine. Since her diagnosis in 2017, Miss Tiong has tried various treatment methods to cope with the worsening symptoms. When all available medications could not work, part of her intestine was surgically removed. One of the hardest parts about being a young person with Crohn’s disease is the psychological impact. Besides affecting her daily routine, the disease has also forced her to put her studies on hold for the past one-and-a-half years. “It has been very taxing, physically and mentally, having to deal with repeated surgeries and hospitalisations,” she said. “Sometimes, I feel like I have ‘fomo’ (fear of missing out). At first, I thought, ‘Yay, I get to miss class (due to hospital visits)’, but after a while, the longer you live with it, you realise that everyone else is moving ahead together while you’re left behind.” Worldwide, IBD is on the rise, and Singapore is catching up with the pack. Inflammatory bowel diseases can be demanding to manage at any age, but for young patients, having a long-term condition that affects all aspects of life so early can hit hard. There is no cure, although treatments are available to manage symptoms. Dr Chok Aik Yong said that an estimated 1,500 people here have the disease. He is the medical director at Aelius Surgical Centre in Mount Elizabeth Hospital (Orchard). About half of Dr Chok’s patients are between 20 and 40 years old. The consultant surgeon, who specialises in managing colorectal diseases, treated Miss Tiong. Around 600 patients are now on active follow-up at the IBD clinic of the National University Hospital (NUH) — a number that has steadily grown by around 10 per cent each year. Dr Juanda Leo Hartono said that around two in five of the patients are under 40 years old. The senior consultant is with the hospital’s division of gastroenterology and hepatology, department of medicine. IBD occurs most commonly in early adulthood — between the 20s and 30s — or later in life between the 50s and 60s, Dr Chok said. The cause has not been identified although one school of thought believes that it may be due to autoimmunity (when the immune system attacks its own cells), he added. The doctors told TODAY that a combination of factors, such as changes in diet and lifestyle, stress, smoking or even an increase in antibiotic use, have been linked to the increase of IBD cases worldwide. “Over the last 50 years, there has been dramatic shifts in our diet. For example, people now consume more animal fat and processed food that contain food additives. “There is also a lack of fibre in our diet. All of these have been associated with the rise in IBD cases,” Dr Juanda said. A review study found that a high protein intake was associated with a 3.3-fold increased risk of IBD, Dr Chok said. Dr Melvin Look, director of PanAsia Surgery, a private clinic, explained: “Such triggers may cause a disturbance in our gut microbiome, leading to a weakening of our intestinal barrier and subsequent bacterial invasion and inflammation.” Dr Look is a consultant surgeon in gastrointestinal, laparoscopic and obesity surgery. Miss Tiong believes that if she were diagnosed earlier, she would have been able to control her symptoms better for a longer period of time. In 2015, she was a 15-year-old student preparing for her examinations when she started getting persistent stomach aches and bloody stools. She recalled having fatigue, recurrent low-grade fevers and severe diarrhoea up to eight times a day. Initially dismissed by doctors as stress, Miss Tiong endured the symptoms, which continued well after her exams ended, taking only paracetamol when the pain became unbearable. The frequent stomach aches and diarrhoea made social activities challenging. “I had to ensure that there was always a restroom nearby,” she said. She was officially diagnosed two years later in 2017 after undergoing a colonoscopy, which revealed inflammation in her intestine. Outlining the challenges that young patients face, Dr Juanda said: “When individuals get IBD at a young age, it sets the foundation for their entire future. It may have an impact on their studies, affect their jobs and family planning — even the willingness to start a family may be affected.” Dr Chok said that the chronic inflammation results in multiple negative consequences, including damage and injury to the digestive tract. The digestive system losses its ability to function, digest food and absorb nutrients normally, which can result in nutritional deficiencies. “IBD that is left to progress would have a negative impact on disease and treatment outcomes. “If untreated, this may have medical, financial, and social implications for the young patient, particularly if prolonged hospitalisation or complicated surgical procedures are required. “The social implications are often profound and long-lasting,” Dr Chok added. IBD is also a risk factor for colorectal cancer. “Chronic inflammation due to IBD, particularly among patients who have had the disease for more than 10 years, increases their risk of developing colorectal cancer, despite the relatively young age at diagnosis,” Dr Chok said. Dr Look of PanAsia Surgery said that the risk of people with IBD developing colorectal cancer is four to 10 times that of a person without the disease — and the risk depends on the duration in which the person has had the disease. Other cancers linked to IBD include small bowel cancer, intestinal lymphoma and bile duct cancer. Dr Chok pointed to an analysis of more than 31,000 Asian patients, which found that patients who has had ulcerative colitis for many years have an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The risk of colorectal cancer was reported to be around 4.8 per cent at 20 years and almost 14 per cent at 30 years, based on the findings published in 2017 in The Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology. Severe inflammation of the bowel can also lead to severe complications such as bowel perforation (ruptured bowel) and sepsis (blood infection), which could put life at risk, Dr Chok said. The disease is not the same as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which does not increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. IBS is also a chronic condition that affects the gut but it does not involve chronic and prolonged inflammation of the bowel seen in IBD. Dr Chok said that the treatment for IBS is usually with medications to reduce pain and bloating due to spasms of the intestine. The doctors said that people with IBD will need medications to control the chronic inflammation in the gut. Due to its complexity, the disease is often managed using a multidisciplinary approach, Dr Chok said. For instance, a colorectal surgeon and gastroenterologist will prescribe and administer medications to treat the condition. At the same time, specialised nurses, pharmacists and dieticians work together to optimise nutrition in patients who are unable to absorb enough nutrients to meet the body’s daily requirements. Dr Look said that while surgery may be able to remove the diseased segment of the bowel, it is not usually the primary treatment option for IBD. This is because patients may experience a disturbance in bowel function if a large amount of intestine is removed. Dr Chok said: “Unfortunately, in some cases, surgery is the only solution for the patient, especially when the patient develops complications. These complications may arise from untreated and uncontrolled IBD and postoperative complications (after surgery).” Even then, the treatment journey often does not end with surgery. “After surgery, most patients require medications and treatments either weekly, once in two weeks, or every six weeks, for a continued duration of six months to one year,” Dr Chok added. “This has a huge impact on the finances and productivity of the patient. To achieve long-term control of the IBD, biologic therapy may be required for some patients.” Biologic therapy is a form of treatment using drugs derived from animal or human proteins. Last year, Miss Tiong opted for surgery to remove a severely affected segment of her intestine when medication could no longer help her manage the inflammation. Despite trying several biologics, the effects were only temporary. However, after surgery, complications occurred. She developed a leak at the surgical site, which led to an infection and a hospital stay of three months. To manage the complication, intestinal fluids had to be drained through a tube and she was put on full bowel rest. “This meant I could not eat or drink, and had to take sustenance intravenously for a few months,” she explained. The complications persisted and Miss Tiong eventually decided to transfer to another hospital, where she came under the care of Dr Chok at the time. A second surgery was performed to introduce a stoma bag that collected stools outside of the body to allow the bowel to rest. Miss Tiong said that she chose to go with a temporary stoma bag instead of waiting for the situation to improve because the procedure would enable her to resume eating and allow her surgical site to heal properly, while diverting waste out of the intestine into an external colostomy bag. “I expected the first surgery to get me better, but that didn’t happen,” she added. “Having to deal with the side effects that came with it, not knowing when I will get better and having to go for more surgeries to fix the complications — all the uncertainty wore me down a lot because I don’t know when the suffering will end.” She lived with a stoma bag for several months before undergoing a third operation in February this year to reverse the stoma and fix the leak in her intestine. While the stoma healed well, she was re-admitted for other complications from her first surgery. Today, Miss Tiong still gets weekly injections to control her condition, but she is recovering well and gradually returning to normal activities. She recently went for a walk with a friend — something that she no longer takes for granted. “I’m extremely grateful for the support of my family, especially my mother, who has stood by my side every step of the way. My friends have also been accommodating,” she said. She still has to be cautious about what she eats. For example, she has to take small frequent easily digestible meals such as porridge, steamed fish and minced meat, and avoid high-fibre foods such as vegetables, fruit and nuts temporarily because these will stress her intestines. “I am working closely with a dietitian to return to a normal diet soon,” she said, adding that she hasn’t eaten fast food for more than a year. “Sometimes I miss food from McDonald’s but I can’t eat it now.” Having experienced the isolation of battling IBD, Miss Tiong feels that there needs to be more awareness and avenues of support for young people such as herself. “There is a lot of information on the internet, but much of it is catered to Westerners.” For instance, on how people with IBD cope with the disease, most of the accounts were from people living outside Asia and the tips they gave may not apply to her. “Diet-wise, some of the food and diet plans they recommend do not align with the typical Asian diet. Some of the websites recommend taking applesauce, (easier to digest) after a Crohn’s flare, but I’ve never heard of applesauce before researching the topic,” she said. “Back then, I felt quite lost. If you’re young, have a considerably rare condition and no one to turn to, it can feel very lonely,” she said, adding that she found out about the Crohn's and Colitis Society of Singapore recently. The society has a patient support group and works with healthcare professionals to organise talks on IBD so that patients can learn to better manage their condition. Miss Tiong’s experience has changed her perspectives on having children as well as her career aspiration. She has decided against having children in the future. “There’s no clear cause (for Crohn’s disease) but I really don’t want to risk it. If it’s a genetic cause, and I pass it down to my kids, I don’t think that’s very fair to them.” As for her career, she hopes to pursue a master’s in art therapy after completing her degree studies. “Through my sessions with an art therapist in the hospital, I realised that having a creative outlet helped me processed what I was going through. Now, I want to similarly help youth who are also struggling, too,” she said Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — The weekend fun is over, and as you lie in bed on a Sunday night, a slight sense of dread washes over you. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — The weekend fun is over, and as you lie in bed on a Sunday night, a slight sense of dread washes over you. If you have ever felt down or a little anxious at the thought of returning to work after the weekend, you are not alone. The good news is that it is usually a temporary lull in mood that most people shrug off as they get back into the swing of things. Still, even if people really love their jobs, almost anyone can be afflicted by the “Monday blues”, experts said. Part of the reason is that workers need time to “rekindle their momentum” after the weekend’s downtime, they added. Ms Ooi Sze Jin, founder and psychologist at A Kind Place, said: “Think of our mind as akin to a car engine; it requires time to warm up.” She added: “At the start of a new week, we essentially need to rekindle our momentum and adapt to the demands ahead.” This anticipation of the work week’s impending demands and pressures could bring on the “Monday blues”, often marked by apprehension and anxiety. In the first of a new weekly mental health series, TODAY speaks with experts on why the Monday blues occur, how to identify when they have become a bigger problem, and tips on how to beat this weekly road bump. Ms Isabelle Han, a counsellor at the Singapore Association for Mental Health Insight Centre, said that Monday blues could be attributed to a variety of factors. These include job dissatisfaction, or stressors such as being faced with personal or relationship problems over the weekend. The glum start to the week may also simply result from the transition back to work — which may signify impending stress and challenges or conflict — especially after two relaxing days. Agreeing, Ms Ooi noted that many workers may find themselves immersed in busy schedules during the work week, with their hours often extending beyond the “regular 9am to 6pm” and into overtime. “When the weekend arrives, it offers a welcome respite, allowing people to take a breather and recharge. “However, as the weekend draws to a close, they must return to the familiar weekday routine, which can feel like a sudden shift,” she said. Regardless of workers' genuine passion for their chosen field, it is completely normal to be hit with the Monday blues, the experts said. Ms Ooi added: “The anticipation of resuming work responsibilities and the many tasks ahead can generate a sense of apprehension and anxiety, regardless of one’s job satisfaction.” Still, Ms Ooi and Ms Han agreed that the regular blues are typically characterised by a transient dip in one’s mood or productivity. “The Monday blues often manifest as a temporary dip in mood, reduced productivity, or a sense of reluctance when facing the work week,” Ms Ooi said. Ms Han said that this should only last for a short while, and people should be able to “pick up their energy level and focus on work subsequently without too much resistance”. However, if these downbeat feelings persist over a longer period, this may indicate that the matter has evolved into more troubling behaviour, the experts said. “Basically, if the duration one experiences Monday blues is longer and does not happen only on Mondays, it could be an indication of other mental health concerns such as depression,” Ms Han said. “Emotions are generally transient while mental health conditions would persist for a longer period of time,” she added. Ms Ooi highlighted some likely red flags: “When any of these more severe indicators become noticeable, it may be a signal to take a step back and contemplate the need for assistance or adjustments in one’s work-life balance,” Ms Ooi said. She also said that recognising these signs early is essential for one’s overall well-being, and can help to prevent the development of more significant challenges. Ms Ooi and Ms Han offered some tips on how to lighten one’s mood ahead of the work week, while also better managing work-related blues the rest of the week: 1. Begin by taking a moment to assess and evaluate your upcoming week 2. Create a Monday morning routine that you look forward to 3. Create a structure and strategise your workload for the week 4. “Reclaim” your time throughout the week 5. Practise mindfulness and meditation 6. Build a positive relationship with your colleagues Acknowledging that the Monday blues is becoming more common among her clients, Ms Ooi said: “While work may hold a significant place in your identity, it’s crucial not to allow it to overshadow your entire life. “As individuals, it’s essential to recognise that we are more than just our work roles and to prioritise moments for the activities that bring us joy and fulfilment.” Ultimately, doing so and nurturing a “positive outlook on life” not only enhances people's moods, but also boosts their performance at work while fostering better relationships with those around them, she added.

Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — Shortly after 23-year-old David experienced his first bouts of panic attacks in 2019, he knew instinctively that he needed to get help. It took him almost a whole year of grappling with suicidal thoughts, however, before he finally told a close friend what he was going through. Even then, he struggled to get the words out of his mouth. Mental health experts agree that broaching the topic can be challenging, particularly with people we are close to, as opening up about one’s mental health struggles can feel like opening a can of worms. “We are worried about how they will think of us, and sometimes fear the response that we will get from them. We may also not want to cause them to overly worry for us,” said Dr Timothy Singham, a clinical psychologist with Viriya Community Services. For David, who did not want to be identified by his real name, this was especially true. \"I didn't want people to think that I was weak, and I didn't want people to question why I felt that way... because on the surface nothing seemed to be wrong with my life,\" he said. \"My greatest fear was my friends thinking I was saying it to gain pity or attention or something.\" As part of a new weekly mental health series, TODAY asked experts how one should broach the often uncomfortable topic of their personal mental health struggles with others, and likewise, what they can do if someone confides in them. While there is no “single formula” to having that conversation, experts said that there are a few things one can keep in mind. The first step is finding the right setting and timing for the conversation, preferably with someone who is likely to be open-minded, supportive and willing to listen, said Mr Sam Roberts, founder and director of the Olive Branch Counselling, Psychology and Therapy Clinic. After finding a quiet and comfortable place where both parties can take their time to speak without interruptions, Dr Singham said that one should kick start the conversation by “honestly sharing how you have been feeling recently, and the impact it has been having on you”. It also okay to set your own boundaries and not share everything in one conversation — especially if it is the first time you are opening up, he added. One should also set clear expectations on what they are looking for when they share, be it advice, resources, or simply a listening ear, said Mr Roberts. This would help them figure out the best way to respond and help. As conversations about mental health become increasingly common, experts believe that it is crucial for society to know how to respond appropriately and supportively when friends and family open up about their struggles. In TODAY’s conversations with youths trained in providing peer support, a common theme that surfaced is the understated impact one can have simply by “being there” — present and free of judgement. Mr Jedaiah Chen, the 27-year-old founder of mental health social enterprise I’m Friendly Co, said that while it is crucial for people to understand what mental health is and how it affects an individual, one need not have complete knowledge of it to support a friend in a bad place. “Everyday people like you and I have the potential to help others,” he said. “For many people, they could potentially be standing at the pathway between life and death and we just don't know… You could be in the right position to make a huge difference in that person's life — that first touch point to getting people the help that they need.” Here’s what mental health experts and advocates said we can do to support our loved ones: 1. Acknowledge and validate their emotions Mr Thomas Eyun, Clinical Director at Youthline, said that acknowledging a friend’s mental health condition and thanking them for their trust to share their problems is a good first step to take. “It is important to not pass comments such as ‘are you sure or not?’, or ‘just try to snap out of it”, or similar types of remarks as it may come off as hurtful, and make them feel like they are not being heard or taken seriously,” he said. People should also focus on listening to understand as opposed to figuring out how to best respond or give advice, said Ms Alyssa Reinoso, co-founder of social enterprise Calm Collective. Ms Sheryl Ho, a trained facilitator for the enterprise’s peer support programme Calm Circles, added: “Let them know that you believe their emotions are valid, which can be as simple as ‘this is a real challenge you’re facing — it’s difficult for anyone’. “This simple act of validation shows empathy and makes them feel heard and understood.” One can validate any emotion, negative or positive, without agreeing with specific actions or behaviours, the 26-year-old added. 2. Ask questions with genuine empathy and curiosity, while respecting boundaries Ms Ho and Ms Reinoso said that asking open-ended questions — like “what thoughts are coming up for you?” or “how did that make you feel?” — can help foster a sense of safety and control for the person opening up, as it allows them to guide the discussion at a pace they are comfortable with. A common misconception around providing support is that asking someone questions about difficult or sensitive topics should be avoided, said Ms Reinoso. She cited her own experience of dealing with grief after the passing of her late husband, in which people had tended to “skirt around the topic” as they feared it would trigger sad memories. “Sometimes it would feel really invalidating if people pretended that everything was fine and nothing major just happened in my life,” she said. “It’s very possible that that friend is craving for a listening ear to vent their frustrations or feelings.” However, we should still respect their boundaries and not push for information that they are not ready to share, Ms Ho said. 3. Ask how they’d like to be supported and check in with them when you can Mental health experts and advocates agreed that each individual requires different forms of help for their struggles, and that it is okay to ask them for the ways in which they prefer you to support them. They added that while our instinctive response to hearing about their problems is to offer solutions, giving unsolicited advice may be counter-productive. “Sometimes people just want to be heard, and sometimes they can even figure out their own solutions by talking things through. Advice-giving has the potential to curtail that process or even discourage someone from expressing their thoughts and feelings,” said Ms Reinoso. “Our experience of what worked for us might not work for them. However, this isn’t a rigid rule — if someone is seeking advice, then it’s okay to share it.” But sometimes, people may not have the capacity to articulate what they may want or need during the conversation. Such was the case for Ms Arathi Devandran, 32, who went through a challenging time after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2022. In such instances, Ms Devandran believes that simple words and actions that show your care and concern “can never go wrong”. “Even if that person doesn't want to communicate, something as simple as ‘hey, I'm thinking about you today,’ or ‘I'm available this week if you want to do something’ is fine as well,” she said. “Just be patient and be compassionate, and keep trying... they will not forget that you tried.” Ultimately, what we can do best as a friend is to be there to listen and provide a space for them to feel supported or affirmed, said Ms Reinoso. “While we probably won’t be able to solve their problems, peer support can help to challenge some of the assumptions one may have about feeling alone and unloved, or even give them the courage to seek further professional help.” Agreeing, Mr Eyun believes that while we can never truly comprehend how much pain or suffering our loved ones are going through, all we can do is to put on our “empathy hat”. “Often just your presence alone — the act of being there, with no words spoken — is all that is needed to soothe or bring a sense of calm and serenity to your friend.” For 27-year-old David, he said he was glad that he opened up to his friends, as he knew he \"could not have gone through it alone\". \"Even if for example I could tell they didn't know what to say, having them there made me feel like 'okay, I'm not alone', and I don't have to deal with it myself,\" he said. \"Having that sense of comfort that I don't have to hide anything from them was very important for me mentally in trying to get better.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — Helpline volunteer Aisyah Abu Bakar recalled speaking to someone who had sought help on Youthline's chatline, but he was giving monosyllabic responses to her questions. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — Helpline volunteer Aisyah Abu Bakar recalled speaking to someone who had sought help on Youthline's chatline, but he was giving monosyllabic responses to her questions. So she asked: \"What are some songs that best describe your current situation?\" That broke the ice, as the caller became more responsive and gave a long list of songs he loved. Noticing the common themes of heartbreak and pain in the songs the caller shared, she then asked if the music reflected what he was feeling at the moment, which opened up the conversation into discussing why he was seeking help. This is but one of the text conversations that Ms Aisyah has had with young people who seek help through Youthline’s WhatsApp chat line. The 24-year-old is visually impaired so she uses \"text-to-voice\" assistive technology, which converts text into spoken words. Another volunteer at Youthline is Mr Kevin Wong, who is 32 years old this year and studying for a master’s degree in counselling and guidance at the National Institute of Education. He takes calls from the helpline and provides pro bono in-person counselling. Both Ms Aisyah and Mr Wong have been surprised by the depths of struggle and isolation that some of their clients have faced. This is even though the issues that young people tend to share over the conversations – often ranging from anxiety over studies or work to family issues – may be personally relatable to the volunteers. “Some of the clients who come to the helpline, they face really intense issues that need sorting out. But they lack the support around them,” Ms Aisyah said. Agreeing, Mr Wong said that he has spoken to clients who have endured complex experiences of clinical depression and grief, even at a young age. Youthline is a registered charity founded last year that provides mental health services to young persons. It also runs the first youth-dedicated live helpline for anyone up to 35 years old. It now supports up to 300 callers a week, with calls ranging from as short as 10 minutes to as long as five hours. Another helpline that caters to a general public, Touchline by Touch Community Services, receives an average of about 100 calls a month. Around 30 out of a total of 320 calls for the last three months were from young persons. TODAY spoke to the people behind helplines that provide mental help support for the youth, to understand what is involved in such calls and what kind of support they provide for those in need. Even though starting a conversation about one's mental health with a stranger may seem daunting, the helpline volunteers told TODAY that the caller sets the pace and tone of the conversation. Helpline officers are trained to convey empathy and not to judge the caller. For first-time callers, Mr Wong assures them that whatever is shared will be kept confidential and there is no pressure for callers to reveal their name. Over the WhatsApp chatline, a helpline care officer will attend to a chat within 30 seconds, unless there is a high volume. Ms Aisyah said that she lets conversations take its natural course and tries to look at issues through the other person's point of view in a non-judgemental manner. For those who may have a harder time opening up, she typically starts discussing a more general topic, such as asking if they have had lunch or what interests they might have. “This helps in bridging the human connection and trust between the texter and helpline care officer before delving into their issues,” she added. Helpline care officers then gauge what support the individual needs, because some might simply need an outlet to vent their feelings, while others need a partner to brainstorm ways to approach a certain situation. The non-judgemental and confidential space offered by a helpline can support youth who may need a listening ear on issues affecting their mental health. Ms Andrea Chan, head of Touch Mental Wellness at Touch Community Services, said: “We also receive calls from young adults who are finding out if what they are facing is normal. Generally, there is a lack of knowledge and a sense of helplessness when they call for help.” Agreeing, Ms Aisyah said: “Sometimes, people have this mindset that seeking help is a weakness, but it is a form of empowerment. “I always have this idea that it is okay to not be okay. But it's not okay to remain not okay.” Youthline said that one third of the texts and calls from youth tend to be regarding mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, delusions or hallucinations. Another third have psycho-social problems such as stress, concerns regarding self-esteem and self-worth, or a sleep disorder. A third of their clients reach out regarding high-risk conditions such as suicidal thoughts, self-harm, sexual assault, bullying as well as relationship and family issues. At Touchline, the youth tend to call to discuss challenges in school or relationship problems with a partner or family member. “Over the years, the demands on youth have increased. Besides the usual familial, social and academic stress, they also need to juggle a digital identity and the complexity of being in a highly globalised world,” Ms Chan said. Taking the first step to reach out for help takes courage, but Ms Aisyah said that young people who do seek help can find access to “abundant resources” such as helplines and free counselling services. A helpline can serve as a first point of contact, as a space for them to feel welcomed and assured that their concerns will be taken seriously and their feelings validated, while also being a way to link them up to relevant resources. Ms Aisyah said: “If you really don't know what (resources) are meant for you, it's okay, you can just reach out and express what you need or what your issue is and you will get referred to somewhere that is much more helpful to your situation.” Mr Wong said that helpline care officers are trained to support the caller to share more about the problem they are facing and to explore the resources and coping strategies or solutions they may have already tried. They also help the individuals to explore other options or resources they can consider to address their problems. Reaching out to one’s social system for support is key, Mr Wong said. “Sometimes you're so caught up in your work, studies and life and you think, ‘Okay, never mind, I'm going to say no to meeting my friends, I'm going to say no to spending time with my mum and taking a walk in the Botanic Gardens… But sometimes, you have to say yes to these things, because these things are important and you get to spend time with family and friends, and be in nature.” Ms Chan from Touch Community Services said that being willing to reach out for help and talk to a family member or friend who can provide support, or seeking professional help if the thoughts or challenges one is facing become unmanageable,is a key way to protect mental well-being. “The path to mental wellness is not necessarily linear. Periods of high stressors may come our way, but one thing we can do is to band together and provide that support to each other,” she added. People should also diversify their support system, Ms Aisyah said. “The support system you are dependent on may get exhausted and burnt out, and sometimes may not be able to attend to you fully. So getting a wide range of support systems is important. Plus, it helps to have different perspectives,” she added. If you, or anyone you know might want to talk to someone, you can reach out to one of the helplines below.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — In an effort to eat healthily, people may try to make better food choices when they dine out or at home, choosing to eat a bowl of noodle soup instead of fried food at the hawker centre, or have a salad or a “cleaner” lunch. Fishball noodle soup, a salad with croutons, cheese and thousand island dressing, and even a baguette have a considerable amount of salt in them. SINGAPORE — In an effort to eat healthily, people may try to make better food choices when they dine out or at home, choosing to eat a bowl of noodle soup instead of fried food at the hawker centre, or have a salad or a “cleaner” lunch. Yet, even when they choose one of these seemingly healthier food options, they might be exceeding the daily limit of sodium intake. High sodium intake is among the pressing public health concerns in Singapore, with nine in 10 people here consuming almost double the recommended daily limit by the World Health Organization, which is 2,000mg of sodium — equivalent to 5g or slightly less than a teaspoon of salt. Salt is made up of 40 per cent sodium and 60 per cent chloride. Findings from the National Nutrition Survey 2022 here showed that the daily sodium intake of Singapore residents rose from 3,480mg in 2019 to 3,620mg last year. Along with this was a drastic increase in the proportion of people with hypertension, or high blood pressure. In 2021 and 2022, more than a third of Singaporeans (37 per cent) were found to have hypertension. The figure was nearly double of the 19.8 per cent in 2010. The chronic disease — which increases the risk of life-threatening illnesses such as kidney failure, stroke and heart attacks — does not affect only older adults. Professor Tan Huay Cheem, senior consultant at the National University Heart Centre, Singapore, pointed out that around one in 12 (8.1 per cent) of young people between 18 and 29 years old have hypertension, based on the recent National Population Health Survey. Prof Tan, who is chairman of the Singapore Heart Foundation, added: “For this young population, the risk of developing cardiovascular complications in future is significant.” He recently spoke at the Symposium on Sodium Reduction in Singapore and the Role of Salt Substitutes, which took place at the Lifelong Learning Institute on Oct 21. Organised by the Singapore Heart Foundation, the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, and National Kidney Foundation, the event featured talks and discussions on reducing sodium intake and the prevalence of heart and kidney-related illnesses in the population here. Senior dietitian Natalie Yeo from the Singapore Heart Foundation said that a major source of sodium comes from salt and sauces added during food preparation and cooking, as well as in meals sold at eating places. “Some foods such as bread, breakfast cereals and processed meats are fairly rich in sodium, too. And all of these can add up,” she said. Some foods are obviously high in salt (such as fries, bacon, tinned and preserved food), but you will also need to look out for the less obvious choices that may be loaded with sodium. For example: The sodium content for each dish or food item may vary, depending on how it is prepared. Sports drinks are promoted to help replenish electrolytes, fluids and glucose lost during a strenuous workout, improve endurance and energy levels. Steer clear of these drinks if you are watching your sodium intake and not exercising vigorously or for extended periods of time. Sports drinks contain electrolytes such as sodium and potassium. Depending on the brand, the sodium content for every 100ml of the drink can range from 46mg to 92mg. For example, a 325ml can of 100 Plus contains around 150mg of sodium. Such drinks are designed for use during exercise sessions that last more than 90 minutes, Ms Yeo said. “They are more suited to support athletes during their training by fuelling energy to the muscles and brain,” she added. “It is not a good idea to turn to electrolyte drinks as a go-to beverage because it is possible to over-indulge. “If the individual is not doing a vigorous workout, it could add to his or her overall calorie and sugar intake, too.” Ms Yeo said that the increase in salt intake and hypertension numbers reflects evolving lifestyles and dietary habits among Singaporeans. “For example, individuals with busy and hectic lifestyles tend to eat out more than cook. “Without being mindful, sodium intake could quickly add up while dining out regularly,” she said. “Also, there is an increasing availability of processed foods on the go, as well as a wide variety of choices available through food delivery services.” Our tastebuds play a role, too. If you have always been eating food high in salt content, that can dull the sensitivity of your tastebuds. “This results in a need for a higher concentration of salt for one to detect saltiness,” Ms Yeo added. While sodium is an essential nutrient for the body, it needs only around 500mg — or less than a quarter teaspoon — each day to function normally, Prof Tan said. The nutrient helps transmit nerve impulses, contract and relax muscle fibres including those in the heart and blood vessels, and maintain a proper fluid balance. However, too much sodium is harmful to body. After having a salty meal, a person may experience symptoms such as feeling bloated, feet swelling, thirst and frequent urination. “Natural excretion of excess salt will be carried out by the body. “(The symptoms) are usually self-limiting and resolve with time, with little consequences as the body able to regulate the sodium level through natural excretion,” Prof Tan explained. “However, too many holiday parties, rich salty hors d’oeuvres, delectable cakes and pudding can harm your cardiovascular health. This can increase risk of high blood pressure and stroke,” he added. “High level of sodium in the blood stream reduces the kidneys’ ability to remove water. “This can cause the body to retain water, resulting in an increase in overall blood volume, which then increases stress on the blood vessels, causing hypertension.” Prof Tan said that it is important to reduce sodium intake from an early age. From age 18, people should also monitor their blood pressure even though hypertension is less common in younger people. Ms Yeo said that slowly reducing sodium from your diet and adjusting to less salty flavours can help people get accustomed to a lower-sodium diet. This can be done in 21 days or three weeks. She suggested doing this gradually over three weeks, starting with being more mindful of food choices when dining out, buying takeaways or ordering in: Ms Yeo said one thing to note is that Himalayan salt, sea salt, rock salt and kosher salt are not table-salt substitutes since they have similar sodium content by weight. In a joint statement, the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, Singapore Heart Foundation and National Kidney Foundation emphasised the urgent need to reduce sodium intake in the population here to prevent diseases. One of the key strategies it highlighted at the symposium last month was the use of lower-sodium salt substitutes, such as potassium-enriched salt and other salt blends with monosodium-glutamate or yeast extract. Lower-sodium salt substitutes use a variety of minerals and ingredients to lower the sodium content of the product while preserving taste. “These substitutes can be used as one-for-one replacements for regular salt,” Prof Tan said. Derived from glutamate, flavour enhancer MSG is a naturally occurring amino acid that is found in nearly all foods. MSG can be used as a substitute for salt or used to replace some sodium chloride in table salt. It contains less than a third of sodium in table salt. This is among the strategies to reduce sodium intake, by the Singapore Nutrition and Dietetics Association, Singapore Heart Foundation, and National Kidney Foundation. In a joint statement issued by these three parties at a symposium last month on sodium and salt substitutes, they also highlighted that: Senior dietitian Natalie Yeo from the Singapore Heart Foundation said it is important to note that MSG can still affect one’s health if it increases the person’s sodium intake. In a 2022 study cited in the National Library of Medicine, a biomedical library in Maryland of the United States, the recommended dose for daily consumption of MSG is less than 6g a day for adults Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — Whether it is groin discomfort, a burning sensation when urinating or trouble maintaining an erection, there are some below-the-belt symptoms that should not be ignored, even in younger men. In conjunction with men’s health awareness month in November, TODAY asked doctors about the most common urological problems that they see in younger male adults, the warning signs of a serious condition and what to know to prevent them. 1. AN INFLAMED PROSTATE Prostate conditions are often associated with older adults, but younger men can also experience problems with their small, walnut-shaped organ located between the bladder and penis. Prostatitis, or an inflamed prostate, is among the most common conditions seen among younger men in their 20s to 40s. “As with every organ in the body, the prostate can get infected,” Dr Jay Lim said. The urologist in private practice with PanAsia Surgery Group added that in many cases, it is unclear why it happens but when the source is isolated, it is usually related to a bacterial infection of the urinary tract. Unlike a urinary tract infection (UTI), he said that the symptoms for an inflamed prostate can be hard to pinpoint and some patients may have difficulty describing their symptoms. “They sometimes feel that something is wrong, when they go to the toilet, when they sit or stand. Many of them describe this ‘heavy’ sensation but may not have overt symptoms like fever or blood in the urine when they have prostatitis,” Dr Lim said. A suspicious symptom would be bloody or painful ejaculation. Some people may report a pulling ache or a vague sensation in the perineal region (the area between the anus and the scrotum). Symptoms associated with UTI such as blood in the urine and painful urination can also occur with prostatitis. Most cases are not life-threatening and the immune system will fend it off, but Dr Lim advised men to seek medical attention and get prostatitis treated. “Treatment in the form of oral antibiotics for two weeks is usually recommended as it helps with the symptoms and prevent progression,” he said. “Without treatment, there will be symptoms and the recovery journey will take longer — months — to resolve.\" In patients with existing conditions such as diabetes, prostatitis can worsen and evolve into a prostatic abscess (a build-up of pus within the prostate), he added. 2. ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION AND LINKS TO STROKE OR HEART DISEASE For men who have trouble obtaining or sustaining an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse, there is more to worry about other than their sexual performance. It could be a warning sign of a serious medical condition, such as heart disease or stroke. It is estimated that erectile dysfunction may precede the first cardiovascular event by an average of three years. This is based on a review published in 2021 in the Journal of Clinical Medicine, an international and peer-reviewed journal on clinical and pre-clinical research. One of the common conditions seen at the department of urology in Sengkang General Hospital is erectile dysfunction and it can happen to men of any age group. In Singapore, a past study have shown that about half of the men over the age of 30 have some degree of erectile dysfunction. The condition becomes more prevalent and gets worse with age, particularly after 50. Dr Thomas Chan, a consultant with Sengkang General Hospital’s department of urology, said, “Although it is more likely to occur with the advancement of age, it is a common misconception that erectile dysfunction is purely due to ageing.” “From our experience (managing this group of patients), erectile dysfunction can be attributed to overt or even undiagnosed metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.” That said, not all erectile dysfunction is due to blocked arteries or other underlying medical conditions. For some younger men, psychological factors such as stress, relationship problems and performance anxiety could affect their ability to achieve adequate erection. 3. URINARY TROUBLES AND LINKS TO SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE There are many reasons why men get UTIs: Diabetes, kidney stones and dehydration, for example. An enlarged prostate due to ageing could also lead to recurrent infections. Dr Tan Wei Jie from Dtap Clinic said that in younger men, one of the common causes for UTI is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). “At Dtap, due to the nature of our practice, we see young men coming into our clinic with symptoms, and the majority of them will end up being diagnosed with a form of STI.” Dtap clinics offer a general practitioner’s services with a focus on men and women’s health including sexual health. It also provides screening for STIs and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Common STIs that can cause urological symptoms are chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, mycoplasma and ureaplasma — Dr Tan sees around 10 to 20 of such cases each week. Some of these infections spread by sexual activity can also cause inflammation of the testicle and epididymis (the coiled tube behind each testis that stores and carries sperm). Besides painful urination and increased trips to the bathroom, other warning signs may include discharge from the penis, painful sex, blisters and sores around the genitals or anus. Dr Tan said: “If any of those symptoms are present, you need to visit your healthcare providers as soon as possible for investigations and treatment. “STIs that are left untreated can develop complications such as infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, kidney infection and even cancers affecting the penis, anus, back of the throat, cervix and vagina.” Untreated STIs can also be transmitted very easily through sexual intercourse. Individuals with symptoms should avoid sexual intercourse until they have been tested and cleared from the infection, Dr Tan added. He also pointed out that some STIs can have no symptoms, so it is important to undergo regular screening to avoid passing any unwanted diseases to loved ones. 4. KIDNEY STONES FROM DEHYDRATION Kidney stones is a painful urinary disorder that is more common among men and usually among those between 20 and 40 years old, the National Kidney Foundation states. Living in a tropical climate, excessive caffeine intake from coffee, tea or cola, as well as not drinking enough water, are prime conditions for the body to develop kidney stones, Dr Lim from PanAsia Surgery said. He also said that Singapore is situated along the “global stone belt” along with northern Australia, India, the Middle East and the southern part of the United States. People living in these places are more susceptible to developing kidney stones. These hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys can affect any part of the urinary tract. “Caffeine beverages cause diuresis (increased urine flow or output) and contributes to dehydration of the body. A high-salt diet and high consumption of meat, along with a high oxalate intake, puts one at a greater risk of kidney stones as well as UTI,” Dr Lim explained. Foods rich in oxalate include peanuts, soy, almonds, potatoes, tea, cereal grains and beets. Kidney stones can set off symptoms such as sudden back or flank pain, blood in urine and recurrent UTIs. When stones obstruct urine flow, severe pain or renal colic (sudden, acute pain in the kidney area) is often described as a 10-out-of-10 pain. “Without treatment, urine flow is obstructed and the obstructions can affect kidney function,” Dr Lim said. Urosepsis, a life-threatening condition, can occur when the obstructed urine becomes infected. “Even if the infection doesn’t happen, long-term obstruction of the kidney leads to destruction of the obstructed kidney. I’ve encountered patients in their 20s who lose one of their kidneys due to previously undiagnosed stone diseases,” Dr Lim added. 1. STAY HYDRATED, PRACTISE SAFE SEX Dr Lim said that many urological conditions that occur in younger men are preventable through simple changes to lifestyle and diet. Getting adequate hydration is one way, for example. However, how much fluid is considered “adequate” to prevent kidney stones? International guidelines recommend “producing 2.5L of urine per day”, Dr Lim said. “To achieve that, one would need around 3L of pH neutral fluids (water) because you lose around 500ml through sweat, skin and saliva,” he added. “But that may not be feasible. For my patients, I’ll tell them that minimally around 1.5L to 2L (around six to eight cups) of pH-neutral fluids a day is good enough.” Dr Lim emphasised that the recommended fluid intake should not include caffeinated drinks such as coffee, tea and soft drinks. “Everyone thinks that you’re taking in fluids when you drink caffeinated beverages, but they do not count. They are a diuretic,” he said, meaning that they causes an increase in urine production. “To simplify things, I tell my patients to imagine that if you drink a cup of coffee, you'll have to remember to top it up — with around 1.5 cups of water. While it's not exactly the amount, it helps my patients remember better.” Dr Lim said that not holding in urine for long periods of time and voiding after sexual intercourse are other ways that may reduce the risk of urological problems. “Bodily fluids are exchanged during sexual intercourse. Voiding after intercourse (which refers to urinating after sex) helps with flushing the urethra and prevents UTIs,” he explained. The doctors said that there are no specific check-ups or screening programmes for most urological conditions and for younger men. “Unless UTIs and stone diseases plague you or you have a family history of urological issues, most men below 50 will not need to see a urologist,” Dr Lim said. “However, it would be prudent to undergo an annual health screening that includes a urine test and imaging of the kidneys, which can detect early onset of urological problems.” Protecting against STI is also important. Dr Tan from Dtap advised men to practise safe sex by using a condom, staying in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship, reducing the number of sexual partners and abstaining from high-risk sexual intercourse. He also advised staying up-to-date with the latest vaccinations for hepatitis B and the human papilloma virus that can be transmitted via sexual activity. 2. DO KEGEL EXERCISES Women are often told to do Kegel exercises as a way to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles and improve bladder and bowel control, especially after pregnancy and childbirth. They can benefit men in several ways, too, including alleviating certain urological symptoms. Dr Chan from Sengkang General Hospital said that Kegel exercises are often recommended to men to prevent stress urinary incontinence — or urine leak — or who are recovering from it. Urine leak is a common side effect in the first few months after a prostatectomy (partial or complete removal of the prostate) for prostate cancer. The exercises may help ease symptoms of an overactive bladder. They have also been advocated as a potential treatment method for erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation, Dr Chan added. “The strengthening of the pelvic floor muscles may improve penile rigidity in erectile dysfunction and may help delay premature ejaculation,” he said. To reap the benefits, however, the right set of muscles must be engaged during the exercise. “The technique of Kegel exercises is often a difficult concept for men to understand and apply. But once it is understood, it can be done anytime, anywhere,” Dr Chan said. To locate the pelvic floor muscles, try stopping urination mid-stream or tightening the muscles required to keep from passing out gas. Once you have done so, perform two different series of Kegel exercises, with these tips from Dr Chan. Consult a urologist or specialist nurse if you want to do the Kegel exercises but still have difficulty locating the pelvic floor muscles.

    "article_content": "Gen Y Speaks If you looked up the phrase \"going hard\" on Urban Dictionary, you'd probably find a picture of my face. Grace Ke, 32, developed bilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis as a result of body dysmorphia and eating disorders. She recently underwent surgery for both knees. If you looked up the phrase \"going hard\" on Urban Dictionary, you'd probably find a picture of my face. At age 19, before I had even officially received my diploma, I started working my first full-time job in advertising while doing my degree part-time. My days were spent working insane hours, going to class, partying late into the night, taking naps and hitting the gym, before going to work and beginning the cycle all over again. Unsurprisingly for someone who can't sit still, I love sports. Boxing, bouldering, surfing, diving, hiking — if it doesn’t involve a racquet, I’m into it. But most of all, I love football — not just for the technicality and complexity of the game, but also the camaraderie. My teammates and I have made promises that we would play together until we’re in our 60s. In order to improve and play injury-free for longer, I invested in personal training sessions followed my trainer's online programme for years. You’d usually see me in the gym for three to six hours a week. The difference my efforts made were undeniable: After a few months on this regime, I was hitting personal bests on every lift. Then, it came to October this year. After over 13 years of non-stop hustling, I was finally on sabbatical from work. I was at my strongest and healthiest. My mental health was the best it's been in years. To top it all off, I was now married to my dream guy! All the pieces of my life had finally fallen into place. I was happy; more importantly, I was hopeful for what I thought to be a bright future ahead. I was walking home after football one day, and, without any warning, my right knee just buckled. Right away, I knew something was deeply, chillingly wrong. As I lay still in an MRI scanner, the worst-case scenario in my mind was a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL) — a short-term problem that can typically be fixed with surgery and diligent rehabilitation. But days later, when I hobbled into the doctor's office to receive my results and saw the concern in his kind eyes, I knew I was in for a rough ride. Being diagnosed with bilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis at age 32 is pretty damning. Most people with this condition are over the age of 50, and the usual prognosis would be to do a double knee replacement surgery and to give up contact sports. After my consultation, I sat in the car and cried for a long while. I’m too young to switch out contact sports for swimming! I’m too young for osteoarthritis! I’ve been 165 cm tall since I was 12 years old. At my lightest, I was 46 kg and at my heaviest, I was 75 kg. Pretty drastic, I know. I grew up in the era of Keira Knightley and Kate Moss, but my genetical make-up is more \"Trim and Fit Club\". Fellow millennials will know TAF Club really meant FAT Club, where we were taught that if we wanted to lose weight, we had to eat less and run more. The more I ran in school, the more I realised I could actually run pretty fast. In a way, I was happily surprised: My body was good at something! I started receiving compliments on my weight loss. This spurred me to keep piling on the runs, always going faster and longer — all while subsisting on a diet of salads. By the time I was 16, I was running an average of 10 to 20 km a day, with no proper training, footwear, recovery or nutrition. One day, 3 km into a casual jog, my knees buckled. Afraid to find out what it meant, I avoided seeing a doctor and also stopped running altogether. That was the point at which the cartilage in my knees begun to degrade. And I wouldn’t find out for another decade. I am proof that body dysmorphia and eating disorders aren’t just mental health conditions. They also have a long-lasting, possibly permanent impact on our physical health. Upon getting diagnosed, I had only one goal in mind: To get back onto the football pitch as soon as humanly possible. Within a week, I’d completed a bilateral arthroscopic debridement, chondroplasty and meniscus repair with the help of my doctor, Dr Gurpal Singh. By the second day I was doing pull-ups and had walked over 1300 steps, feeling very proud of myself for being able to move and shower independently. On the third day, in the midst of making the arduous preparations now required for me to undertake a simple shower, it suddenly hit me that I was just at the starting line, and the road to rebuilding my strength and stamina from scratch is a long one. I cried again. It took me a while to process and embrace the full spectrum of my feelings. Hours in therapy has enabled me to acknowledge the beauty of being human: We are complex and messy. The sooner we learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the more wholeheartedly we can live. A week after my operation, a vase I'd ordered for a friend arrived — coincidentally enough, with its legs broken. I decided to order a separate Kintsugi set and attempt to fix the vase on my own. It’s messy and it’s not perfect — but it holds up, and my friend loves it. For me, this was an encouraging reminder that perfection is overrated, and that while my body may never be back at 100 per cent, a new beauty can emerge from the mess. I may not be able to play three matches in a row ever again, but I don’t have to give up on football, and total knee replacement is not inevitable. I’ve started sessions at Physio Circle. Their philosophy is “No last game”, which I've taken to heart. I recently managed my first push-ups in nearly a month, and I’m once again looking forward to the future. Slowing down has also given me the chance to finally start the podcast that's been on my to-do list for years now, titled Naked.Graced, where I'm excited to share my ugly, uncomfortable, authentic stories that will hopefully resonate with my fellow human beings. I have no idea what the future holds, but I know that it’s going to be worth it. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Grace Ke, 32, is an aspiring podcaster who founded her mental health podcast Naked.Graced.

    "article_content": "Singapore Scrolling through news headlines and social media, the world often seems like a scary place: People doing risky things that could harm themselves, sexual predators, mass shootings, hate crime, wars and the possibility of human extinction due to climate change and environmental disasters. Scrolling through news headlines and social media, the world often seems like a scary place: People doing risky things that could harm themselves, sexual predators, mass shootings, hate crime, wars and the possibility of human extinction due to climate change and environmental disasters . If such grim world events are anxiety-inducing even for adults, what more children? As parents, even though our instinct is to shield our children from bad and harmful things, living in a world with unfettered access to unfiltered information means that they will inevitably be exposed to such news at some point during their growing years. When that happens, what can parents do to help their children process it? Several months ago, I learnt a lesson the hard way when my younger child — aged nine at the time — went into an anxiety spin. The trigger? A conversation that my husband, our 16-year-old daughter and I had after learning that Japan was releasing radioactive water from its Fukushima nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean. Somehow, our discussion took a dark turn. We started imagining all sorts of hypothetical scenarios on how life might end on Earth. At one point during our conversation, I made an offhand comment: “If there’s a zombie apocalypse, I don’t think we can survive.” To us, it was just chatter over the dinner table, but for my nine-year-old child, she was looking increasingly anxious and panicky by the minute. Our conversation stopped when she burst into tears and screamed at us to stop frightening her. My girl’s emotional state went downhill from there. For weeks, she ruminated over what we had discussed and refused to eat seafood. When pressed to share her feelings, she would tear up and say: “Is the world going to end because we do bad things to the environment?” I could not alleviate her anxiety even when I explained that we were merely discussing something hypothetical, something that was based on possible ideas or situations rather than real ones. “But humans are destroying the environment, right?” she said several times when I tried to reassure her. As my child’s anxiety went on for weeks, I bitterly regretted not considering how she would digest the news and gloomy topic, given her age and sensitive temperament. After speaking to mental health experts, I learnt that while it is not wrong to keep children informed of what is happening around them and the world at large, one needs to be mindful of how the news is shared with them. A lot would depend on their age and level of development and maturity. It also means that negative news shared with a primary school-going child should be very different from that shared with a 16-year-old. Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist with Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness who treats children, youth and adults, said that young minds might find it challenging to differentiate between an event happening miles away and immediate personal danger. “We must be careful not to overexpose young children to upsetting news that could create a sense of fear and insecurity about the world.” He pointed out that teenagers can handle more complex news and engage in discussions about socio-political causes and effects of such events, but a younger child may have difficulty making sense of the details. “When discussing negative news with a nine-year-old or someone younger, it’s important to focus on instilling values such as compassion and significance of helping others, rather than going into the grim details of the events. “On the other hand, discussing negative news with a teenager provides an opportunity to encourage critical thinking and awareness regarding world affairs.” Mr John Shepherd Lim, chief well-being officer of the Singapore Counselling Centre, said that it is more appropriate to share negative news with children who are seven years old and above — with the appropriate guidance and context. At that age, they are better able to discern what is real and fake, as well as the probability of situations or crises happening to people around them. He explained: “According to (Jean) Piaget’s stages of development, from two to seven years old, children are developing abstract thinking — such as thinking about the past or future instead of what is happening before them in the present. “However, their way of thinking is still considered egocentric, so they are unable to understand that others think differently from them or that events going on around them are not related to them.” Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget was known for his work on child cognitive development. Even among children of the same age, Mr Lim said that every child may have different responses to “scary” world news because they may process information and emotions differently. For instance, children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) may tend to fixate on the events and struggle to let go of their emotions. “Therefore, it is important to be aware of the changes in the child’s behaviour before and after exposure. “Children can experience intense negative emotions such as stress or anxiety from learning about the events, because they may be afraid that it can happen to their loved ones,” Mr Lim added. If the child continues to show signs of anxiety and distress and has trouble going about his or her daily activities, consider seeking professional help. Even though my daughter may seem old enough to understand what she heard when we talked about the bad news, Dr Lim said that her fearful reaction suggested that she may not yet be emotionally or cognitively equipped to handle complex global issues at her age. “While children do develop empathy at this age, they often lack the necessary context to fully comprehend intricate issues, which can lead to increased anxiety. “Therefore, it is crucial to reassure her and provide a sense of hope and security,” he advised. He recounted encountering an eight-year-old boy who developed severe anxiety, nightmares and fears of dying after being exposed to scenes of patients dying in hospital and body bags in other countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. The exposure, together with overhearing his parents discussing their fears of dying from Covid-19, heightened his anxiety. “A delicate balance is required in managing a child’s exposure to negative news,’ he added. “We may have to be mindful about not exposing children to potentially traumatising information, but they should also not be overly sheltered, resulting in ignorance or absence of a sense of caution. “Having a balance helps nurture well-informed, resilient individuals who are aware of the world, but not burdened by its complexities beyond their cognitive ability.” Mr Lim from Singapore Counselling Centre said that parents may guide conversations on negative news by answering questions that their child has without over-explaining the details. Acknowledge the child’s fear and anxiety, and let the child know that it is normal to feel that way, he advised. It is also important for parents who feel anxious or fearful about stressful or tragic news to help their children understand that their own feelings are not directed at the children. Explain in simple terms, for example, “I’m worried because people that we do not know are getting hurt”, Mr Lim suggested. “Parents can also stick to routines as much as possible to ensure that their child feels a sense of security despite their turbulent feelings.” Don’t neglect to share good or light-hearted news with your child. For example, news about people saving others. Talking about what the child can control in their situation to help others is helpful as well, Mr Lim said. For example, making donations or taking part in recycling efforts. Dr Lim said that focusing on what one has control over is a powerful tool in managing anxiety, especially in a world that can often feel unsettled and unpredictable. “When we guide children to concentrate on positive actions, such as contributing to a cause, we help them develop resilience,” he explained. “It’s about shifting from a passive to an active mindset, showing children that while they may not be able to change everything, they can make a difference in their own way. “This not only helps them cope with anxiety, but also builds a sense of responsibility, self-efficacy and empowerment.” Looking back at the conversation I had with my husband and older daughter, the words we had used such as “radioactive fallout” and “nuclear disaster” — without given the full context of the matter — would have painted a terrifying picture in my younger girl’s mind. Dr Lim said: “It is important to communicate with the child in a way that matches her level of maturity, using familiar and relatable context to make it easier for her to grasp the situation.” Telling her not to worry or over-think did not help. What I found helpful was to give her age-appropriate facts and a bit more context of what we had discussed. For example, we explained the reasons why the wastewater had to be dealt with that way and what the authorities said about the plan. We also took the chance to introduce the concept of radioactivity in simple terms. For example, how people are exposed to radiation from natural sources in everyday life such as sunlight as well as naturally occurring radioactive materials in the ground, soil and water. Some food items such as bananas, Brazil nuts and potatoes are also naturally radioactive. On my part, I also learnt to be more mindful about what and how I talk about current affairs and news when my younger child is around. No more flippant doomsaying. Her anxiety gradually abated. Recently, I asked her if she still wanted to know what was happening around the world and how I should tell her without terrifying her. She said: “I want to know. But just don’t start off talking about a zombie apocalypse, okay? How can anyone not panic about that, Mum?” Right. Guess I’ll just keep my walking dead theories to myself and stick to facts.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — When disappointment, failure, sadness and loss hit all at once, being grateful, or feeling any positive emotion, may be the last thing on your mind. SINGAPORE — When disappointment, failure, sadness and loss hit all at once, being grateful, or feeling any positive emotion, may be the last thing on your mind. Just ask Ms Eva K Peters, who experienced several setbacks in the past year. Besides having to come to terms with missing out on an award that she had expected to receive, the postgraduate at the Singapore Management University (SMU) was grieving when her grandmother died earlier this year. What lifted her from the doldrums eventually was when she looked on what had happened through the lens of gratitude. “Mind you, I am still not happy about not receiving the award — and that’s okay, and an appropriate emotion to have in this context. I am nonetheless thankful for the insight that I gained about myself and my personal and professional aspirations through failure,” she said, rather than focusing on it being an outcome of her own insufficiency or incompetence. A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidate in organisational behaviour and human resources whose dissertation centres around mindfulness, Ms Peters started developing this “skill” of being grateful regularly in 2019 after becoming a certified yoga teacher. Gratitude is a quality one can possess and it can be cultivated by recognising and appreciating the different aspects of life. “When I began my PhD that focuses on mindfulness, I also read about the beneficial effects of gratitude practice from a research scientific perspective,” she said. “I think that was an additional motivation for me to incorporate gratitude practices in my life more intentionally.” So even though Ms Peters cried and mourned the loss of her 93-year-old grandmother, one thing she felt grateful for was the memory of the good times they had together and the years they spent in each other's company. She said that gratitude has also helped her to better navigate failures and disappointments. “I feel that by practising gratitude, we can have a richer experience of life because we can see both the negative and positive sides of all that happens to us.” There are many proven health benefits to feeling grateful and expressing gratitude. It is the key to a happier and healthier life, and helps one bounce back from adversity. Professor Jochen Reb, a professor of organisational behaviour and human resources at SMU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Business, said: “Gratitude is a well-researched emotion and it’s clear that experiencing it brings both mental and general health benefits, including positive affect and lower stress.” He is also the founding director of the Mindfulness Initiative @ SMU, which was started in 2013 to support research in educational and outreach projects on mindfulness, with programmes that are open to the general public and corporate organisations. Ms Peters said that people who are grateful are generally healthier than those who are not. They also experience less stress, sleep better and have better self-esteem and interpersonal relationships. Adjunct Associate Professor Angie Chew, founder and chief executive officer of Brahm Centre, a mental health charity dedicated to promoting happier and healthier living, said: “If you really have gratitude imbued in you, then you would be a happier person because you don't take things or people for granted.” She is a certified mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) teacher as well as a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy course teacher. Mindfulness is the awareness of one’s internal states and surroundings. To be mindful means to be fully present, aware of where one is and what one is doing at the moment without judging or being overly reactive. On the flipside, a lack of gratitude can contribute to negative mental health outcomes, Ms Peters said. For example, there may be more frequent experiences of negative mood, a generally negative mindset, social isolation and increased stress. “Someone who lacks gratitude may be prone to focus on what’s missing in their life, as opposed to what they already have. This may contribute to a general sense of discontentment, which can negatively affect one’s mental health,” she added. In the spectrum of human experience, anyone can be grateful or feel grateful. Prof Reb said that it is “part of our innate emotional repertoire”. However, feeling and expressing the emotion may not come easily to some people. Culture, family environment and life circumstances play a role. For example, if the behaviour was not modelled in the family or the environment in which the person grew up, it may be harder for the person to enact it, Ms Peters said. Elaborating on this, Prof Reb said: “First, we humans learn a lot socially by imitating those around us. “Thus, when children grow up in families where their parents practice appreciation and expressing gratitude, this will shape them. “In contrast, when children grow up with a sense of entitlement, they might feel less gratitude.” “Second, and interestingly, some people come to gratitude through adversity. By experiencing or witnessing hardship, they come to appreciate more the little things in life.” There had been research on this, such as a paper published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal in 2014, which looked at nearly 15,000 adults and the researchers found that people who had dealt with more adversity or setbacks in the past reported an elevated capacity to appreciate life’s simple pleasures. In Singapore, Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew observed that Singaporeans generally have difficulty expressing gratitude and appreciation for others. “We find it difficult because it is not a habit we have developed. I don't think people generally express gratitude as much; even saying ‘thank you’ is not very commonly practised,” she said. A fast-paced lifestyle can also get in the way of experiencing or showing gratitude. “In my experience, a key obstacle is our business. We are often too busy working off items on our to-do list, doing chores or chasing our goals to stop and feel grateful,” Prof Reb said. Ms Chang Ching Chen, an MBSR teacher with the Mindfulness Initiative @ SMU, explained that the brain is “wired in a way that makes people tend to go into auto-pilot mode to achieve maximum efficiency”. She said that it can be difficult to put gratitude into words or practice because that will require one to slow down. “We may be rushing from task to task without allowing ourselves to engage with our body sensations, emotions and others. In the long run, (this) may make us appear entitled and ill-mannered,” Ms Chang said. Ms Peters believes another reason could be that people have difficulty connecting to their emotions. “Today’s world is very ‘head-centred’, meaning that we place a lot of value on thinking, reasoning and information processing. “The fact that so much funding money is going into the creation of businesses powered by artificial intelligence — which one could argue is most related to our cognitive, information-processing version of intelligence rather than emotional intelligence — reflects the value we place on cognition as compared to emotion as a society.” From a young age, people across the globe are being trained and educated to develop their cognitive skills, Ms Peters added. \"Socio-emotional skills are a focus of education to a much smaller extent, even though this is slowly changing now. “The point is that our society, globally, I would argue, has not been placing much emphasis on emotions, identifying them, understanding them and expressing them. \"That is one reason why it may be hard for people to feel and, in a second step, show gratitude.” The good thing is, it is possible to train the mind to experience and express gratitude more easily, much like improving on a skill or training the muscles to become stronger. Ms Peters said: “Experiencing gratitude has a reinforcing effect. In that sense, the more gratitude we are able to experience in a given moment, the more likely we are going to experience more gratitude in the future.” Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew pointed out that all habits can be learnt. This applies to gratitude as well. \"For example, just because we paid for something, we feel like we don't have to say ‘thank you’, we just take it and walk off,\" she said. \"If we want to cultivate gratitude, that it becomes a habit, then I think we all have to consciously show appreciation.” That means saying a word of thanks to the service provider. “Words mean something and they evoke a certain feeling. For example, if you complain about something, it evokes a feeling; if you don’t complain, then that feeling isn’t evoked. Similarly, if you don't say 'thank you', then you don't evoke gratitude,” Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew added. With regular practice, feeling and showing gratitude can get easier over time. Here are some tips from the experts. 1. SLOW DOWN Cultivating gratitude can be hard when one is rushing around to complete tasks. Before you can count all your blessings, slowing down is necessary. “Pause, take a mindful breath,” Ms Chang suggested. 2. THINK OF THINGS TO BE THANKFUL FOR EACH DAY Next, focus on what you are grateful for. As part of the mindfulness-based programmes offered at the Mindfulness Initiative @ SMU, participants learn a practice called “three good things”, Prof Reb said. This involves bringing to mind three good things that have happened to them. “This can be little things, such as a cup of coffee, hearing a bird sing or the smile of another person,” he said. At Brahm Centre, participants are taught the daily “10 finger gratitude practice”, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy practice that involves recognising that you are grateful for 10 things and people in life. Count them. Such practices help people to refocus on what they have instead of what they lack. Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew explained: “The mind, by default, is always looking out for what we lack, is missing, faulty and threats. “By doing this, it helps the mind not to stay in the default mode. “We train the mind to be grateful and be in the present, so you don’t keep ruminating about the past, worrying about the future — that’s how you lead a happier life.” 3. ACT ON IT Besides developing a habit of practising gratitude by bringing to mind the things to be thankful for, Prof Reb suggested a step further: Turn feelings of gratitude into a behaviour by showing appreciation to someone to whom you feel grateful. For example, tell them how much you appreciate them, he said. Writing a thoughtful letter to express gratitude is another way to increase feelings of gratitude while letting the other person feel appreciated. In a study published in the American Psychologist in 2005, writing and delivering a detailed Gratitude Letter showed the positive impact on happiness one month later. Study participants who personally delivered and read the letter to the recipient, rather than just mailing it, reaped the greatest benefits. It may be tough but it is possible to still find moments to be grateful for even when facing severe hurt or betrayal. “Cultivating gratitude is not about suppressing or trying to replace negative emotions,” Ms Peters said. “It also does not mean that one negates the pain or finds a way to justify the hurtful actions or events. “Rather, it is about allowing oneself to experience gratitude alongside the negative emotions associated with the event.” It must be emphasised that feelings of gratitude should not be forced. Prof Reb said: “You don’t need to feel obligated or force yourself to feel grateful towards someone or something that hurt you. “Instead, you could feel grateful towards things that helped you through difficult times, such as the presence of family and friends, your own resilience. “When you are ready, you could consider practising another emotion that has shown to have health benefits — forgiveness. “But again, you need not force it.” What about dealing with another person’s entitled and ungrateful behaviour? Adjunct Assoc Prof Chew has this advice: Accept it. “Acceptance is what you can do because it's not up to us to go and change other people,” she said. Prof Reb said that there is little direct control over other people’s emotions. “If we require someone to be grateful, quite likely it will not be an authentic feeling of gratitude, just an act. “Instead we can focus on ourselves by setting a good example. When others see that feeling grateful makes us happy, they might imitate us,” he said.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — As a working adult, Mr Johnny Woo Jia Ying was caught up with getting promoted on the job and accumulating wealth, but surviving a stroke three years ago changed all that. Dear readers, help us make your news reading experience better. We would appreciate it if you could take part in this quick survey . Thank you very much! SINGAPORE — As a working adult, Mr Johnny Woo Jia Ying was caught up with getting promoted on the job and accumulating wealth, but surviving a stroke three years ago changed all that. Now, the 39-year-old Singaporean’s resolution for the new year is simply to “stay alive” and be in good health. In March 2021, a blood vessel in his brain ruptured while he was having a staycation in a hotel here. It was a haemorrhagic stroke and he was 36 at the time. Doctors told TODAY that the incidence of stroke in younger and middle-aged adults has gone up. Recounting how his life changed drastically after this health setback, Mr Woo now wants young people to know that strokes can happen at any age. “Please don’t think a stroke won’t happen to you just because you’re young. “That’s what I thought, too, that a stroke is something that happens only later down the road, but who knew that I would get it before 40?” he said, adding that the stroke was a big wakeup call for him to focus on his health. Before the stroke, he was not paying attention to his health — he had high blood pressure, led a fast-paced lifestyle and loved to drink alcohol. “Do I have regrets? Of course. But for now, I have to move on,” he said. Three years after the stroke, Mr Woo still has some weakness and numbness on the right side of the body and some trouble recalling certain things. He works as an executive at a statutory board. Singing and running marathons — two activities that he used to love doing — are no longer possible. “I used to wish for promotions, to earn more money — those were all very standard and cliched (goals). “But since having a stroke, I just want to stay alive and keep healthy, as well as for everyone around me to be healthy,” he said. There are two main types of strokes: Young and middle-aged adults may think that they are safe from strokes. However, it can happen at any age and figures show that it is affecting more young people. Referring to the latest data from the Singapore Stroke Registry Annual Report published in November 2023, Dr Alfred Seng said that although the number of young stroke patients are relatively small compared to those aged 60 and above, their rates have risen over the years. For example, in the 40 to 49 age group, the incidence rate of stroke increased from 73.4 to 97.5 per 100,000 population — a 33 per cent rise — over 10 years (from 2011 to 2021). For those in Mr Woo’s age group (30 to 39 years), the stroke incidence rate rose by almost 50 per cent, from 17.8 to 26.4 per 100,000 population over the same period. Dr Seng is a stroke rehabilitation consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and is an executive committee member of the Singapore National Stroke Association. The association is a support network for stroke survivors and caregivers. It supports more than 800 stroke survivors, of whom 28 are aged 40 and younger. The youngest member is 22 years old, Dr Seng said. Doctors said that the main reasons for the increase are linked to risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidaemia (high blood cholesterol) and obesity. Most of these, though, are modifiable with lifestyle changes or treatments that control the conditions. Dr Kaavya Narasimhalu, consultant with the National Neuroscience Institute, where Mr Woo was admitted to the intensive care unit, said that more people now have such risk factors at a younger age. In younger adults, the biggest risk factor for a stroke is hypertension, followed by smoking, she said. Research shows that uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of stroke by four times. Those who smoke 20 cigarettes a day are also six times more likely to have a stroke compared to a non-smoker, the World Stroke Association states. Misguided fears about taking medication for chronic conditions may mean that some patients are not getting the treatment they need to control stroke risk factors. Dr Kaavya said: “I think many people here have this fear of taking medicine. “They may think ‘I have hypertension (but) it's not causing me any problems, so I'm not going to deal with it’. “They just don't want to know, and even if they know that they have a (medical condition), they don't want to treat it. That's a big problem.” She added: “It's a bit foolhardy to say, ‘I know my blood pressure is high but I'm not going to do anything about it’. “You always want to prevent (strokes) rather than treat them when they happen.” A stressful lifestyle is also a possible stroke risk. In a study published in the medical journal Jama Network Open in 2022, psycho-social stress reported by patients within the previous 12 months before a stroke happened were associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke. Referring to the study, Dr Zhao Yi Jing, a neurologist with Zhao Neurology and Headache Clinic in Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said that stress can cause changes in the body and lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases such as an increase in blood pressure. “Stress can also cause inflammation in the body, which can lead to a build-up of plaque in the arteries and increase the risk of a stroke,” she said. Dr Kaavya said that stress could also be an indirect risk factor for strokes. “When we're stressed, we may do things that are not great for us, like smoke, drink or eat fatty food,” she said. Mr Woo believes that he might have been a ticking timebomb since 2015. Back then, a health check for a separate medical condition revealed that he had high blood pressure, but he did not follow up on his abnormal blood pressure reading. “I didn’t like to go for medical check-ups,” he said. Besides his love for heavily salted foods such as sausages and pork knuckles, Mr Woo also loved drinking alcohol. He used to be easily anxious and stressed, which he believed contributed to the stroke. Several days before it struck, Mr Woo had headaches but he attributed the symptom to a tiring day at work. He was having a staycation with his wife when he started experiencing drowsiness, weakness in his limbs on the right side and difficulties typing. “Even then, I convinced myself that I was simply tired,” he recalled. “But when I tried to stand up, my right leg gave way and I collapsed. By then, I could not speak.” Mr Woo’s wife Koh Yu Fang, 34, who works in a treasury, said that she knew a stroke had occurred when she saw that his face drooping and she immediately called the ambulance. “I’m not working in the medical field but I’d have to thank the Health Promotion Board and the media for educating me on stroke signs. “The medics and doctor said that luckily, I reacted fast (and called for an ambulance),” she added. When treating a stroke, time is of the essence. “Brain cells begin to die when they are deprived of oxygen,” Dr Zhao explained. “If the person reaches the hospital’s emergency department within hours of the symptom onset, early treatment can be instituted, which may reduce the severity of the stroke,” Dr Seng said. Dr Kaavya said that in ischaemic stroke patients, there is a narrow window — about 4.5 hours — in which medication can be given to try to dissolve the clot that is blocking the blood vessel. For haemorrhagic strokes, the aim would be to bring down the blood pressure as fast as possible to lessen the bleeding in the brain. “Most times with strokes, unless you’re within that window period, there’s not much to do to reverse it once it has happened. “So, the best way to do anything about (stroke) is to prevent it,” Dr Kaavya added. “A lot of the rehabilitation work in stroke is training other areas of the brain that are not affected to take over the work of what is already affected.” A stroke is an emergency because more than a million brain cells die every minute that it goes untreated. Learn to spot the signs with the FAST method: Other symptoms of stroke include double vision or vision loss on one side, difficulty swallowing or imbalance when walking. Note that some people may suffer a “mini stroke”, or a transient ischaemic attack initially, where symptoms resolve within 24 hours. Seek medical attention immediately and do not dismiss the symptoms even if they resolve because this attack is often a warning sign of an impending stroke. Sources: Although younger survivors show more potential for better recovery compared to older ones, they have a harder time getting used to a different way of life after a stroke. “Younger adults are in the productive stages of their lives — starting and building their families and careers, “ Dr Seng said. “They also have important roles to play as spouses or parents and to support their dependents.” Depression occurs in about a third of stroke survivors at any one time — and the mental health condition is associated with poorer function post-stroke and higher mortality, he added. Getting in touch with patient support groups such as the Singapore National Stroke Association can be helpful. Dr Kaavya said: “Young people generally do better than older people in terms of recovering from a stroke. But then, take into account that they would have their residual disability for many more decades compared to an older person.” Post-stroke, about 30 per cent of patients will have cognitive symptoms, she added. These can range from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, affecting many aspects of life such as memory, thinking, planning, language and attention span. Mr Woo underwent months of rehabilitation to re-learn how to speak, eat, walk and use the bathroom independently. He continues to experience side effects. For example, he now takes a longer time to memorise things and speaks more slowly. Due to numbness of his vocal cords, he can no longer belt out his favourite songs. He can no longer run. Heavy lifting is also out of the question. Visibly emotional when he talked about the things he can no longer do, he said: “I tell my friends that I’m now half a man. “As the man in the household, I’m supposed to lead, but because of (the side effects from stroke), I can’t do certain things. So it feels like I’m not a complete man. “For example, I can’t lift heavy things. I feel bad that my wife has to take on that role. Sometimes, I will still help as much as I can with my left arm.” Mdm Koh does not feel the same way and always tells her husband not to think like that. On his recovery, she said: “With love and patience, nothing is impossible.” Despite the setback, what has gone well was that Mr Woo turned his lifestyle and diet around. “When I woke up in intensive care, I told myself, ‘No more alcohol’,” he said. He now has a healthy, balanced diet and tracks his blood pressure regularly. He has also learnt to better manage his emotions. “When things were not in my way, I used to get easily frustrated and angsty. “Now I’m a lot calmer; I even feel it in my brain because... my head now feels a lot less ‘tight’.” Besides having a caring spouse and family, he attributed his recovery to a supportive boss and early return to work. “Working required me to remember things, so that definitely kickstarted my brain and helped with my recovery.” Mr Woo also has another wish for the year: To start a family. “We had to postpone many things after the stroke episode. Now, my wife and I are trying for a baby. Hopeful for a (Year of the Dragon) baby,” he said, referring to the zodiac animal for Chinese New Year in 2024.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — In the lead-up to Chinese New Year, families will be making plans for their annual reunion meal and in Singapore, a popular choice is to have a steamboat dinner either at home or an eatery. Fried and raw food items, along with peanut sauce for dipping, are set at a dining table, ready to be cooked in a hot pot of soup or broth for a communal meal. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — In the lead-up to Chinese New Year , families will be making plans for their annual reunion meal and in Singapore, a popular choice is to have a steamboat dinner either at home or an eatery. A steamboat or hot-pot meal is a communal dining concept where people dunk raw food items into a boiling pot of soup and then fish them out when they are cooked, to be eaten with dipping sauces and other accompaniments such as rice or noodles. Not only is it a cost-effective way to feed a large group of people, cooking an assortment of ingredients in simmering broth is also often thought of as a “healthier” option compared to tucking into greasy, fried dishes at Chinese food places. Food that is boiled should be healthy, right? Well, that depends on how it is eaten and what else are served on the side, health experts said. Yes, if one is mindful of what goes into the steamboat dinner, it can be a nutritious balanced meal. On the other hand, a single indulgent steamboat dinner may also easily bust a day’s — or even two days’ — worth of the recommended calorie, fat and sodium intake for each person. Dr Jonathan Chong from DTAP Clinic at Novena Medical Centre said: “Steamboat meals may not necessarily be as healthy as people think they are. While often seen as a healthier option, they can have many drawbacks and potential health repercussions.” Dietitian Chloe Ong said that there is often a fine line between what is healthy and unhealthy. A principal dietitian at Parkway Cancer Centre, she added: “A steamboat meal can have as low as 400 calories if the person is disciplined and picks more vegetables, lean protein and avoids the oily dipping sauces. “But it can have as much as even 2,000 calories if the soup base is oily and the person picks a lot of fatty meat slices and includes dipping sauces such as chilli oil, peanut butter dips and soya sauce, not to mention if there’re also sugary or alcoholic drinks with the hot-pot meal.” The average recommended daily caloric intake for adults is 2,200 calories for males and 1,800 calories for females. While a single overly indulgent reunion meal is unlikely to result in any serious health repercussions, repeated consumption of steamboat meals may result in the development of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes over time, Dr Chong said. In particular, people with pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and kidney issues should exercise added caution when consuming steamboat meals, he added. “For individuals who already have such conditions, there may be a worsening of the control over these conditions in the immediate aftermath of such meals. For instance, deterioration in blood sugar control in patients with diabetes, an elevated blood pressure or increase in cholesterol levels.” Mala broth (1 bowl): 218 calories, 3.6g of saturated fat, 895mg of sodium Laksa gravy (1 bowl): 355 calories, 22.6g of saturated fat, 1,500mg of sodium Clear chicken broth prepared without chicken skin (1 bowl): 113 calories, 1g of saturated fat, 171mg of sodium. Tofu with fish paste (1 piece): 63 calories, 0.7g of saturated fat, 71mg of sodium Fried beancurd skin (1 piece): 79 calories, 3g of saturated fat, 15mg of sodium Enoki (straw) mushroom (1 portion): 45 calories, 0g of saturated fat, 0mg of sodium Fishball, boiled (1 piece): 17 calories, 0g of saturated fat, 165mg of sodium Pork meatball (1 piece): 87 calories, 2.4g of saturated fat, 127mg of sodium Squidball (1 piece): 40 calories, 1.2g of saturated fat, 103mg of sodium Prawnball (1 piece): 41 calories, 1.2g of saturated fat, 123mg of sodium Canned luncheon meat (1 slice): 147 calories, 5.2g of saturated fat, 392mg of sodium Shabu shabu (very thinly sliced) lean pork (3 pieces): 141 calories, 2.2g of saturated fat, 45mg of sodium Pork belly (3 pieces): 378 calories, 14g of saturated fat, 24mg of sodium Mackerel fish (1 portion): 115 calories, 1.8g of saturated fat, 99mg of sodium King prawn (1 piece): 17 calories, 0.1g of saturated fat, 90mg of sodium Boiled cabbage (1 cup): 22 calories, 0g of saturated fat, 8mg of sodium Boiled spinach (1 cup): 23 calories, 0g of saturated fat, 70mg of sodium *Nutrient content taken from nBuddy (Nutritionist Buddy), a mobile application conceptualised by Dr Lim Su Lin, chief dietitian at National University Hospital The following are what to look out for when preparing or having a steamboat or hot-pot meal. Not all broths are equal. One of the factors that determines how healthy your meal is the soup base. “Some of the broths used are often high in sodium , which can cause an increase in blood pressure and may be associated with the development of hypertension, Dr Chong said. “Certain soup bases such as the popular mala broth often contain large amounts of oil and saturated fat, which may in turn be linked to high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.” Ms Ong said that “clear” soup bases that are prepared with some pork ribs or chicken parts are generally healthier and lower in sodium compared to those that use instant stock cubes. “If the soup looks ‘creamy’ such as collagen, laksa or mala broth, it may be higher in sodium and saturated fat,” she added. For example, a small bowl of mala broth contains about 220 calories, 3.6g of saturated fat and close to 900mg of sodium, which is almost half the recommended daily sodium limit of 2,000mg set by the World Health Organization. Compare this with a bowl of clear chicken soup, prepared without chicken skin: It contains half the calories at about 115 calories, 1g of saturated fat and about 170mg of sodium. TIP: Dr Chong recommended picking a lighter flavoured, lower-sodium soup base and avoiding drinking too much soup during the meal. Refrain from slurping up the broth after many rounds of continuous boiling of meat slices and seafood, even though it looks and smells very flavourful. This is because at that stage, the soup would be even higher in sodium, fat and purines, Ms Ong said. Purine is a chemical compound found naturally in some foods that breaks down into uric acid. “Prolonged boiling of high purine food would increase the purine content of the soup, which may trigger a gout attack for some people. \"At the same time, sodium content is bad for hypertension and the oily soup can also increase bad cholesterol levels while the added calories could contribute to weight gain as well,” Ms Ong said. Ms Ong said that the dipping sauces that go with the steamboat meal may also pack a load of unwanted calories and sodium. “For example, two tablespoonsful of chilli oil contain about 180 calories, 17g of fat and more than 500mg of sodium. These calories from chilli oil are ‘hidden calories’ that most of us would not be aware of.” Dr Chong pointed out that many ingredients that are commonly eaten from a steamboat such as fishballs, meatballs and crabsticks are usually highly processed and can contain large amounts of sodium and cholesterol as well. For instance, just three pieces of pork meatballs have around 260 calories, 7.2g of saturated fat, 87mg of cholesterol and 381mg of sodium. By comparison, three slices of lean pork contain 141 calories, 2.2g of saturated fat, 51mg of cholesterol and 45mg of sodium. Consumption of processed meats has been consistently linked with higher rates of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, he said. “Some people may think that fishballs, squidballs or prawnballs are pure protein but most of these are usually made of a mixture of starch,” Ms Ong said. TIP: Limit the amount of dipping sauce. Instead of dousing an entire slice of meat with sauce, give it a light dip when flavouring your food. Try choosing natural aromatics such as chopped fresh garlic or spring onions, freshly diced chilli and lower-sodium soya sauce instead of the usual chilli oil and peanut sauce. Instead of placing the processed “balls” and meats immediately into the pot when the soup starts bubbling, start your meal with plenty of fresh vegetables instead before adding leaner cuts of protein. “Choose more fresh vegetables, tofu, mushroom and fresh meat such as lean meat, chicken and seafood, rather than processed marinated meats. In that way, we can reduce the intake of sodium and saturated fat,” Ms Ong said. It is easy to overeat when the elders at the table continuously pile food on your plate or egg you to take more food. However, controlling the amount of carbohydrates consumed in a single meal is especially important for people with a chronic condition such as diabetes, Ms Ong said. “(People with diabetes) will need to take note of all the ingredients that they are having and keep to their carbohydrate allowance. \"For example, if you (usually) consume a bowl of rice (150g) for dinner, be mindful that at a steamboat meal, there may also noodles, dumplings, yam, corn, etc. So, the rice portion should be cut down accordingly,” she advised. TIP: For people on a strict portion control, it might be a good idea to plan in advance. One way to do this is to put aside the carbohydrate food items that you are going to eat, either before or after cooking them in the hot pot, Ms Ong suggested. This is so as not to lose track of how much you have eaten while eating and chatting during the meal. Whenever possible, choose wholegrains such as red or brown rice. If there are only white rice and noodles, portion control is still the most important in managing blood sugar levels. Include more leafy vegetables in your meal for added fibre as that would help slow the blood sugar spike, Ms Ong said. Dr Chong said that a simple way to control meal portions would be to use the Health Promotion Board’s My Healthy Plate guide, which recommends filling half the plate with fruit and vegetables, a quarter with wholegrains and the last quarter with good sources of protein. Dr Chong said that it is not uncommon for people to experience some gastrointestinal symptoms after overindulging in a steamboat feast. For people who have gastroesophageal reflux disease, a condition in which stomach contents flow back up the oesophagus connecting the mouth and stomach, a hot-pot meal may worsen symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. He also said that there is a potential risk of food being undercooked since cooking is done in a communal pot and there is no control over the mix of items placed into the pot at different times. “Some families may also inadvertently place raw and cooked food side by side, which poses a risk for cross-contamination,” he added. Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria and the hepatitis A and E viruses can cause diseases due to improperly handled steamboat food. “Patients with such illnesses typically develop diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever, and should seek immediate medical attention should such symptoms arise,” Dr Chong said. TIP: If you have gastroesophageal reflux, try to avoid dietary triggers such as spicy and fatty foods that can lead to uncomfortable digestive symptoms. Be mindful of how you quench your thirst during a steamboat meal. “Carbonated beverages and caffeine-containing drinks such as sodas, colas and iced teas are often consumed together with steamboat meals,” Dr Chong said. “Such beverages may also be linked to a worsening of symptoms in some patients with gastroesophageal reflux, and should thus be substituted with safer, healthier alternatives such as plain water.” Having some over-the-counter medications on hand may be helpful. “Symptoms (of reflux) can be alleviated with the use of over-the-counter medications like antacids, which usually contain a combination of magnesium, aluminium and calcium compounds. “Such medications neutralise acid and can provide quick relief for symptoms of heartburn,” Dr Chong said. In patients with irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, some studies have found that peppermint oil may potentially be beneficial to reduce post-meal abdominal pain, gas and bloating , he added. “However, should individuals develop more serious symptoms suggestive of food poisoning or food-borne illnesses, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever, it would be advisable to not self-medicate but to seek medical attention for further evaluation and treatment, because complications such as dehydration can occur.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — When Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah and his wife had their fourth child in 2017, he thought that he would be better prepared to walk his wife through the throes of postnatal blues. Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah photographed in Jalan Besar on Feb 2, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah and his wife had their fourth child in 2017, he thought that he would be better prepared to walk his wife through the throes of postnatal blues. “You know, having a fourth child means you’re quite an ‘old bird’ already, lah,” the 46-year-old said, using a term that refers to someone who is well-seasoned. His wife is three years younger than him. “You know that your wife will go through postnatal depression probably, and you’re more or less geared up… you know how to help her out,” he continued. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency was speaking to TODAY on Friday (Feb 2) before Parliament sits next week . Her condition then had not been medically diagnosed, he added, but even with some experience and preparation, having their fourth child was an especially difficult period for the couple, because his wife’s postnatal blues lasted for six months — much longer than he had expected. “And for that whole duration, I think it was quite tough because she was always down. And as much support as I was giving her, I had three other children who also needed their mum.” Their four children are now aged 17, 14, 11 and seven. “Under pressure” to care for his wife and young children then, Dr Rizal expressed gratitude to close friends to whom he could confide and be heard. What helped the family through that period was having a community and strong support network, he remembered. “Although I had to really hold the ship together, I was not alone. I had my parents, I had my in-laws and everybody came in and they became a very strong support system, and that’s why I believe strongly in this. “If you really want to improve mental health in Singapore, it’s about getting that support network strong.” This is why, together with four other MPs from the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) for Health — Dr Tan Wu Meng, Mr Yip Hon Weng, Ms Mariam Jaafar, and Mr Edward Chia — he has filed a parliamentary motion to call for a whole-of-Singapore effort in advancing mental health and well-being. “The essence of the motion is a heartfelt call for unity in nurturing a society where mental well-being is a shared journey, emphasising compassion, understanding, and collective action for the holistic health of every Singaporean,” he said. On why the team had filed the motion, Dr Rizal said that each committee member had their own areas of interest and collectively brought together a “broad kind of expertise”: “For me, it was mental health and… (Ms Mariam’s) in tune with the nuances of the youth, and mental health comes up quite high on the list. Dr Tan Wu Meng, he’s a doctor, so he’s seen his fair share of mental health issues within the community, too.” “But if you look across (the board), all of us really believe that mental health is something that is very pertinent… and it has always been an issue deep within our hearts,” he added. In October last year, the Government launched the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy , which aims to build up the country’s mental health ecosystem to offer accessible clinical care to people who need it. Even though Dr Rizal believes that the national strategy is a good move “in the right direction”, strengthening the community element would be a key focus for the GPC for Health, because they are looking to build on the national plan. “I’m glad that we are all moving in the right direction... it’s all about just refining it. I think the key word I want to use for our motion is that we want to refine. It’s not about revamping a strategy,” he said. Referring to the 2012 Community Mental Health Masterplan and the 2007 National Mental Health Blueprint that came before the latest national strategy, Dr Rizal added: “We always, in a way, refresh and update (our approach) simply because of the way our community changes over time, and the nuances need to be adapted accordingly. “And for us (in the GPC), many of us have been speaking about this for the longest time, and I thought it was timely that the strategy came out and we are able to further the strategy’s plans.” During the interview, apart from talking about the motion the GPC had filed, Dr Rizal also spoke about his motivations for being a long-time advocate for mental health. Recounting the period when his wife was experiencing postnatal depression after they had their fourth child, Dr Rizal recalled two things they did when his wife was struggling: He taught his three older children to help support their mother, aside from relying on an external network of family and friends for support. Dr Rizal told TODAY that what really got him interested in the sphere of mental health and well-being was when he was an officer in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) during his National Service days. Attending to suicide calls as an SCDF officer was an “eye-opener” for him, and it made him more cognisant of mental health conditions and how people wanted to be heard. Since becoming a parliamentarian in 2020, he has spoken extensively about mental health and well-being, often defaulting to the acronym “LAST”, short for literacy, accessibility, screening and time-outs. “If someone were to fall, we know how to provide first aid for the cut, right? You wash, then you put some ointment, and maybe you put a plaster over it. “But what if your friend, someone close to you, has a mental health issue that you probably need first aid for and we don’t have that capability?” How society is going to construct that first aid, is an area to delve deeper into, he said. Some key hurdles that remain in advancing mental health and well-being in Singapore include overcoming stigma associated with mental health illness, learning to provide support for individuals and their caregivers, and strengthening individuals’ support networks, he added. On how Singapore can specifically “go further” in deepening its strategy, Dr Rizal offered some starting points. They include normalising mental health screenings and expanding one’s mental health networks to include a community with shared interests. “If we can equate physical health screening to mental health screening and we make it a norm, I think that would be my greatest dream come true,” he said. Just as physical health screenings tell of an ailment or condition, which then allows for directed solutions to be taken to treat it, Dr Rizal hopes that mental health screenings can offer people greater clarity on how they may better their mental health and well-being. Besides these, he also expressed his hopes for mental health time-outs to be normalised. He suggested focusing on an added element of “spiritual health”, a topic that emerged in his conversations with the community and engagement sessions with young people. Noting that spiritual health was one of seven dimensions of wellness in well-being research, Dr Rizal spoke of the importance of having an “all-encompassing” approach to such healthcare. Emphasising that spirituality was not to be conflated with religious faith even if it could encompass it, he instead likened this aspect of spiritual health to having a “certain direction in life based on a certain set of principles” to help one stay on one’s path. On strengthening one’s support network, he spoke of expanding this beyond one’s circle of family and friends to also include building a community that has shared interests. “The next frontier is really that: We need an empathetic community that understands mental health, that supports one another, and provides opportunities and platforms to share openly. “So one of the things we really feel strongly for is shared spaces — shared safe spaces — and I think it’s very important.” This may be connecting with others through shared interests in gardening, sports, or the arts, he added. Ultimately, his hope for the mental health landscape in Singapore is to create a community that is resilient, knowledgeable about mental health literacy and, finally, able to apply this knowledge to help one another. “And I think the idea is that for those who need help, they’re able to get help without stigma, without fear.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — It is well known that the earlier cancer is detected, the better chance of treating and surviving it. Cancer that has spread becomes more complicated to treat, with those in the advanced stages generally having poorer outcomes. People whose cancer treatment is delayed by even a month have a 6 to 13 per cent higher risk of dying — a risk that continues rising the longer treatment is put off, a study published in 2020 in peer-reviewed medical journal The BMJ suggested. As developed and affluent countries see higher cases of cancer among young people , it is becoming important that this group be made more aware of cancer symptoms so as not to get a delayed diagnosis. As it is, a late diagnosis continues to be the norm in many cases despite advances in medicine. For example, between 2018 and 2021, the majority of lung, stomach and pancreatic cancers were diagnosed in the later stages, based on data from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2021. Even for colorectal cancer , which is among the most common cancers in Singapore, more than half of the diagnoses were after the disease advanced to Stage 3 and Stage 4. Just how long can someone have cancer without knowing that something is seriously wrong? In conjunction with World Cancer Day that was on Feb 4, TODAY asked doctors why some people may not be aware that some cells in their body have gone rogue, and what are the early signs not to ignore. Many factors can affect how early or late the cancer is detected: The type, where it is located, its speed of growth and the uptake for certain cancer screenings, the doctors said. Dr Melvin Look, medical director of PanAsia Surgery and specialist in gastrointestinal cancer surgery, said that it may take “months or even years” before a person experiences any symptoms. He explained: “All cancers initially start at the microscopic level. Because it’s so small, it’s both asymptomatic (no symptoms) and undetectable. “As the tumour slowly increases in size, it may still remain asymptomatic unless a person undergoes special screening tests to look for it.” Eventually, the cancer grows and progresses to the “symptomatic-detectable” stage, Dr Look said. “The symptoms are usually due to the size of the tumour itself, causing a lump that can be painful or painless. “The lump can also cause secondary effects like bleeding or blockage of the organ cavity where it is located.” For example, cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the oesophagus or stomach can cause vomiting, pain or difficulty swallowing. As the cancer spreads to the rest of the body, it can cause symptoms specific to the organ. For example, back pain can be a sign of secondary cancer in the bone, Dr Look added. Secondary cancer is cancer that has spread from where it first originated. How early symptoms show up may depend on where the cancer is located and the speed of growth. 1. LOCATION OF THE CANCER OR ORGAN Explaining why some patients may not feel pain at first even when the cancer is growing, Dr Look said that a cancerous growth starts to cause pain or discomfort only if it invades the nearby nerves or cause a physical compression or obstruction to the organ. “If the cancer is in an organ that has a lot of space like the stomach, the mass needs to be very large before it causes symptoms. “On the other hand, a very early cancer can become symptomatic if it is located in an area that is visible, such as skin cancers, or they happen to produce alarming symptoms (such as bleeding from the nose in nasopharyngeal cancers),” Dr Look added. Another example of a cancer that is hard to detect early due to its deep-seated location is ovarian cancer . Dr Samuel Ow, Singapore Cancer Society’s council member and chairperson of the society’s community health committee, explained: “It’s because the ovaries are very small organs floating in the depths of the pelvis. “On the internet, you’ll see that many people call ovarian cancer the ‘silent whisperer’, so when the patient is diagnosed with ovarian cancer by the time she has symptoms, it’s often at stage three or four.” Dr Ow is also a senior consultant with the department of haematology-oncology at National University Cancer Institute, Singapore. 2. SPEED OF TUMOUR'S GROWTH Dr Look said that some slow-growing tumours, in the thyroid or prostate for example, can remain asymptomatic for a very long time. Dr Ow said: “Slow-growing cancers may not just be organ-specific. Even for breast cancer, there are slower-growing types of breast cancer and faster growing types. “For example, triple negative breast cancers are more aggressive than mucinous breast cancer and tubular breast cancer, which are very slow-growing.” Some people may disregard symptoms due to the mindset that “it won’t happen to me”, Dr Ow said. “Young working individuals who are typically healthy and exercise will not be thinking that they develop cancer, but can they happen to them? Yes, of course.” Cancer was not on 38-year-old Nicole Tan’s mind when she started having unusual symptoms of swallowing difficulties and chest tightness late in 2020. “I went for medical check-ups and the doctors didn’t find anything abnormal, so I assumed that it was stress related and attributed it to anxiety. I didn’t think that it (was anything serious) at my relatively young age,” she said. By April the next year, Ms Tan could no longer keep any food down, vomiting whenever she tried to eat and drink. She was rushed to the emergency department. It turned out to be oesophageal cancer. The oesophagus is a long muscular tube that moves food from the throat to the stomach. “I was shocked and in disbelief for the first hour or so,” she said of what happened after she learnt of the cancer, which was at stage two or three. Dr Look, who treated Ms Tan, said that many patients ignore symptoms because they think it is related to something commonplace such as stress or indigestion. “Young people, tend to delay seeking medical attention because they wrongly believe that cancer only happens in older people. Unfortunately, the incidence of cancer in younger people are in fact on the rise in Singapore,” Dr Look said. For example, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer in the 15 to 34 age group rose by more than 40 per cent — from 27 per 100,000 population between 1993 and 1997 to 39 per 100,000 between 2013 and 2017. This is based on figures from the Singapore Cancer Registry 50th Anniversary Monograph. Some people have “a fear of knowing” and are in denial about their health concerns, Dr Ow said. He once encountered a patient whose breast tumour grew so large (to about 16cm) that it broke through the skin. The woman, who was in her 60s, said that she thought her skin was red as she had rubbed medicated oil and scratched it. Despite being within the recommended age for breast screening, the woman had never gone for a mammogram. “The reason why the cancer was detected was because she developed severe anaemia that made her breathless. Any lay person will know that it’s abnormal, to have something erupt from the breast,” he added. “I think deep down inside, these patients know (that something is wrong). “For (the breast cancer patient), her husband had passed away from pancreatic cancer a year before. I think that had been a traumatic process for her. “I suspect that the condition she faced had occurred while she was caring for her husband as well, so probably she was trying not to deviate from her role as a caregiver.” Thankfully, not all hope was lost for the woman, whose cancer was at Stage 3. She underwent treatment and surgery. “Happy to say that it’s been eight years since, and she remains well,” Dr Ow said. In Singapore, there are national screening guidelines for colorectal, cervical and breast cancer. These are common cancers that have proven screening strategies that affect outcomes. “The reason for screening is because we are trying to cause what we call a stage shift,” Dr Ow explained. “(Cancer) screening is supposed to try to shift the needle, from a later stage to an earlier stage, with the idea that the treatment for the cancer will become less complicated, potentially cause less burden on the healthcare system and also improve overall quality of life and lifespan.” The doctors also advised people not to ignore symptoms, especially if they have gone on for some time. “The key words are ‘unexplained’ or ‘persistent’,” Dr Ow said. “If you notice constitutional symptoms (a group of symptoms that affect many body systems) like constantly feeling tired or fatigue, unexplained weight gain or weight loss, feeling bloated, constantly feeling full or having a poor appetite, it may not be a bad idea to get a medical assessment.” Dr Look pointed out that many early cancers remain in the symptomatic-detectable stage for a long time before they become advanced. For example, in a clinical study he did for his patients with stomach cancer, up to 30 per cent of the early cases remained in this stage for more than a year before they progressed to the advanced stage. When these patients saw Dr Look, they already had symptoms for up to a year. The symptoms for stomach cancer may include indigestion, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain and heartburn. Urging patients not to ignore their symptoms, no matter their age, Dr Look said: “The potential window for diagnosis and cure is therefore significant as long as we do not ignore our symptoms.” Currently in remission, Ms Tan wished that she had been more aware of how to care for her health. Her advice to young people is to listen to their body and advocate for their own health, especially if there are suspicious symptoms. Bringing up the point that alarm bells may not ring for doctors in general because the prospect of cancer in a younger person was hardly thought of as common in the past, she said: “Do not neglect the early signs, and go beyond the basic check-ups even when doctors may dismiss you because you are a young adult.” Learn more about cancer at Our Tampines Hub from 10am to 8pm on Feb 17 and 18. The event is organised by the Singapore Cancer Society to celebrate its 60th anniversary in conjunction with its annual World Cancer Day Carnival.

    "article_content": "Singapore “I like to move it, move it,” the signature tune from the animated Hollywood film Madagascar goes. And health experts want you to know that it is really just moving your body in some way that counts when you want to get started. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — “I like to move it, move it,” the signature tune from the animated Hollywood film Madagascar goes. And health experts want you to know that it is really just moving your body in some way that counts when you want to start building your fitness level — no matter how short a duration, no matter if your marathon-running friend will scoff at your effort. Because after a while, when you get into the groove and sustain it, biological functions will take care of the rest. It has been drilled into us that physical activity is good for us and exercising regularly provides many benefits including better mental and cognitive health. Research has shown that sitting all day and a sedentary lifestyle can kill us fast or raise cancer risks . And nothing beats some ailments and stress like a good workout, which gives us natural painkillers and mood-boosting chemicals. Yet, many people are still not moving more or getting enough exercise . Fitness professional Joel Chia said that sedentarism is a “pandemic”, given that people are moving less. He is a certified personal trainer and senior dietitian at Novi Health, a specialist medical centre that provides personalised solutions to manage chronic health conditions. The National Population Health Survey 2022 released here late last year showed the same thing about physical activity levels. It found that the percentage of Singapore residents engaging in sufficient total physical activity — say, at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity physical activity — has gone down from 84.6 per cent in 2019 to 74.9 per cent in 2022. This was chalked up to reduced commuting from hybrid work arrangements after the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, obesity rates have increased by almost 35 per cent in the past decade — from 8.6 per cent in 2013 to 11.6 per cent for the 2021 to 2022 period. So, what is stopping people from mustering the motivation to exercise? Various barriers found in modern life make it hard for people to carve out the time and will to get moving. Mr Chia gave some examples: Registered psychologist Gerald Boh said that younger adults, in particular, may have “present bias” — the tendency to prioritise the rewards they can get now over long-term future benefits. “If you (tell them) that not exercising increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, a young person may say, ‘I’m still young enough that I can wait’. “Younger people will always have other more urgent priorities that they would want to take care of, like career, setting up a family, their finances. \"It’s not like they think that health is unimportant but rather, they don’t think it’s urgent enough yet.” Mr Boh is the clinical director and principal psychologist at Okay-to-Chat, a private mental health service that uses a combination of face-to-face and e-counselling platforms. He is also an exercise psychologist with PsyFit, which uses psychology, counselling and physical activity to improve health. Perhaps the most interesting research on why people find it hard to get started on exercise is that your brain is just not wired that way. We want to rest more because it is an evolutionary mechanism. Assistant Professor Ivy Yeh from Nanyang Technological University has research expertise in biological anthropology, which is the study of human biological variation and evolution. She and Mr Boh have these to say collectively: Asst Prof Yeh believes that chronic and lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes will become even more prevalent in the next few decades, considering that the modern diet is richer in sugar compared to that in olden times. She said: “Our innate tendency is always to seek the easiest path to accomplish tasks, yet the convenience may not always align with what’s best for health. “We may be increasing in lifespan, but more important is our ‘healthspan’ that is the number of years spent living an active lifestyle and doing what we enjoy in old age.” Now that we know why exercising — or even just moving more every day — does not come naturally to us, here are some psychological techniques to help increase and sustain motivation. Mr Boh advised against setting outcome goals such as “ I want to lose weight ”. Instead, set behavioural goals that are achievable and action-oriented such as \"I will brisk-walk for 30 minutes, five times a week for 12 weeks\". Certain types of physical activities tend to boost and sustain motivation, making regular exercise more sustainable. These include exercises: Here are some tips from Mr Chia the personal trainer: “A partial workout still counts as exercise. Instead of a full hour of exercise, for example, try doing push-ups first thing in the morning,\" Mr Chia said. “Don’t count your exercise minutes; make your exercise count.” Mr Boh emphasised that in getting people to increase their activity levels, “some exercise is better than none”. “If you can do more, that’s better. But the main idea is to keep moving because we have to look at physical activity in totality — exercise is just one aspect. “If you sit in a chair for 10 hours a day and brisk-walked for 30 minutes, you may gain some benefits from the brisk-walking. \"However, certain risks from sitting the whole day may not be remediated. “So we encourage people to just move more, without consciously (overthinking) it,” Mr Boh said.

This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — Late last year, I chanced upon a website that made an outlandish promise: Get paid US$500 (S$670) each time you donate your stool. The website was promoting faecal microbiota transplantation, which is a procedure where faecal matter from a healthy donor is transferred to a gut of a recipient to restore the “balance” of micro-organisms that live in the digestive tract, and this improves their immunity and digestion. However, there was a catch — it is estimated that only 0.1 per cent of the human population is considered healthy enough to qualify as high-quality stool donors. As expected, there were some physical factors: The donor had to be young (preferably under 30), athletic, had a certain stool type and had minimal antibiotic use, since these would affect the micro-organisms in the gut. Then, to my surprise, there were psychological requirements as well: A successful donor had to be typically happy and relatively stress-free, or in other words, was in the pink of mental health. It got me wondering: What does mental health have to do with gut health, and can eating food beneficial to our gut also help our mood as well? I put some questions to Dr Ganesh Ramalingam, who is medical director and specialist in general surgery at G&L Surgical Clinic. He said that psychological factors such as stress, anxiety and depression can indeed influence gut health, through the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. “These stress hormones can affect how our gut works by changing how quickly food is digested, weakening the intestinal walls and disturbing the balance of helpful bacteria inside the gut,” Dr Ganesh said. He specialises in upper gastrointestinal surgeries, among other procedures. This gut-brain link made sense to me — whenever I felt anxious before making a speech in public, or felt nervous about the outcome of a job interview or test result, I would feel my stomach turn and lose all appetite for hours on end. And likewise, our gut health can also affect our mental health. “Inside our gut there are organisms called microbiota that help produce chemicals that affect our mood like serotonin and dopamine,” Dr Ganesh said. “When these microbes are out of balance due to factors like diet or medication, it can contribute to mood disorders like anxiety and depression.” Indeed, a study in 2019 with a sample size of more than 1,000 participants found that two “beneficial bacteria” for the gut — coprococcus and dialister — were less common in people with depression. Such bacteria can be cultivated by consuming fruit, vegetables, whole grains and fermented foods. Another study conducted in Spain in 2009 showed that people who ate the traditional Mediterranean diet — which consists of whole grains, fruit, vegetables, fish, beans and nuts — were about half as likely to receive a diagnosis of depression within a span of four years. For those looking to improve their diet and live a healthier life, it may be heartening to know that it can improve their mental health, too. “What we eat can have an impact on both our gut and mental health,” Dr Ganesh said. “A diet packed with fibre, fruit, vegetables and probiotics supports gut health, which in turn can positively influence mental well-being.” The reverse is also true. “But if we're loading up on processed foods and unhealthy fats, it can throw gut bacteria out of balance, making us more prone to mental health issues,” Dr Ganesh added. This can also turn into a vicious circle if left unchecked: The stress and anxiety triggered by a bad diet can lead to more gastrointestinal issues, which can lead to poorer mental health. When it comes to improving mental health, there is recognition that sports and exercise play a big role. Perhaps it is time other factors such as gut health are taken more seriously as well, Dr Ganesh said. He believes that the link between gut health and mental health means that a “multidisciplinary approach” is needed. “In my view, mental health professionals can include gut health assessments in their treatments, considering factors like diet, stress and gastrointestinal symptoms,” he said. They might then suggest dietary changes alongside other stress management treatment and even refer their patients to gastroenterologists if their gut problems are suspected to be affecting their mental health. Similarly, gastroenterologists could ask about patients' mental health during consultations and work with mental health professionals as needed. “They can also educate patients on the gut-brain connection and suggest lifestyle and diet changes,” Dr Ganesh said.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — In Singapore, an average of 46 people were diagnosed with cancer daily and 16 people died of cancer each day for the period from 2017 to 2021. Ms Amaliah Othaman (right) at the Singapore Cancer Society Clinic@Bishan. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — In Singapore, an average of 46 people were diagnosed with cancer daily and 16 people died of cancer each day for the period from 2017 to 2021. One in four people may develop cancer in their lifetime, the Singapore Cancer Society also states on its website. So screening for cancer is not such an abnormal thing to do. Do you know, for example, that there is a national screening programme, or that there are screening guidelines for some common cancers such as colorectal, breast and cervical cancers? And if you want to get started, do you know which tests to take in relation to cancer detection? For instance, do you really need to check the boxes for all the tumour-marker tests that add to your total bill when you go for a health screening package? With cancer , early detection and treatment are key to better clinical or management outcomes. TODAY speaks to some doctors to find out what to consider when deciding on screening tests. As is usual, people generally do not think that they will get cancer , especially if they perceive themselves as being rather healthy. Take 41-year-old Amaliah Othaman, who is Singaporean and has two children. She decided in 2019 to get her health checked after finding a lump in her breast and it turned out to be benign. “From there, I thought that maybe I should just check out what screenings are available and go for them,” she said. She came upon a free Pap smear or a Pap test offered by the Singapore Cancer Society. In her mid-30s at the time, she had never gone for a Pap test that involves collecting cells from the cervix, which is located at the lower part of the womb. Women who are 25 years old and above and have ever had sex are recommended to go for cervical cancer screening. The test saved her life. The results came back to show that she had Stage 1 cervical cancer. Recalling her shock upon learning of the diagnosis, she said: “I remembered wondering, ‘How is it possible?’ I felt perfectly fine – I had no symptoms, was living an active life and seldom fell sick.\" The cancer diagnosis was a big wake-up call to take her health screenings seriously, she added. Having gone for treatments and survived cancer for almost five years, Ms Amaliah now encourages her family and friends to get screened regularly for peace of mind. “The doctor told me that I was very lucky to detect the cancer early,” she said. Yet, even at that early stage, the treatment involved a major hysterectomy surgery that removed the entire womb, she added. Cancer screening may help detect early signs of cancer, sometimes even before symptoms appear. The Screen for Life programme is a national screening programme that offers eligible Singapore citizens and permanent residents subsidised screenings. 1. For colorectal cancer screening, the faecal immunochemical test — where a small stool sample is collected for a test — is recommended for people aged 50 and above, to be done every year 2. For breast cancer, a mammogram is recommended once every two years for women aged 50 and above. Women in the 40 to 49 age group are also eligible for a mammogram once a year if their doctor has recommended them to go for it 3. For cervical cancer, a Pap smear every three years is recommended for women in the 25 to 29 age group who have ever been sexually active. For those aged 30 and above, a human papillomavirus (HPV) test is recommended every five years. The screening methods above for colon, breasts and cervix have been shown to effectively detect cancer at an earlier stage. In some cases, screening may be able to detect even a pre-cancer development, which is the presence of abnormal cells that could pose a greater risk of becoming cancerous. Colorectal cancer is an example of a well-studied cancer that can be detected even before the actual disease develops. The faecal immunochemical test is a preliminary cancer screening test that detects the presence of small amounts of blood in stools. However, the presence of blood does not mean that the person has cancer; further tests are needed. Dr Melvin Look, a specialist in gastrointestinal cancer surgery and director of PanAsiaSurgery clinic, said that a positive faecal immunochemical test should be followed by colonoscopy for screening. The procedure for a colonoscopy involves preparation the day before of drinking a laxative solution to clear out all solid contents in the intestines. Then, for the scope, a long flexible tube with a light and tiny camera is placed through the anus into the end of the large intestine to look for abnormalities along the intestinal walls and tract. Dr Samuel Ow, Singapore Cancer Society’s council member and chairperson of the society’s community health committee, explained how colonoscopy can potentially detect the cancer at a very early stage, even in a pre-cancer stage. “We know that there’s a continuum. “It begins from normal colon tissue, to a benign polyp (benign lumps that form on the inner wall of the colon and rectum), to a polyp that is starting to develop changes, to a pre-cancer polyp, then to invasive cancer. “This whole developmental process can take a decade or longer. “Therefore when I speak to my patients about screening for colon cancer, I will pitch to them that I'm actually not trying to detect cancer; I'm trying to detect the precursor of cancer and nip it in the bud.” Dr Ow is a senior consultant with the department of haematology-oncology at National University Cancer Institute, Singapore. Dr Look said that the availability and uptake of screening tests in Singapore have helped detect some cancers earlier. For example, about 42 per cent of men with colorectal cancer are diagnosed in the early stages, compared to 19 per cent for lung cancer . For women, more than three quarters of them (77 per cent) with breast cancer are diagnosed early, whereas only 37 per cent of stomach cancer is diagnosed in the early stage, he said. One question you might ask is that why are other forms of “common” cancer such as stomach cancer and lung cancer not on the national screening programme? And with so many types of cancers to watch for, why are there not more routine screening methods to check every organ? Dr Tanujaa Rajasekaran, senior consultant medical oncologist at Parkway Cancer Centre, said that not all cancers have well-established screening methods. Breast, colon and cervical cancers are included in the national screening programmes because they meet several criteria: • They are relatively common • There are effective screening methods available • Early detection has been shown to significantly improve outcomes for these cancers “On the other hand, even though lung, prostate and stomach cancers are also common, there may be challenges with implementing effective screening programmes for these cancers,” Dr Tanujaa said. “For example, there may not be highly accurate and cost-effective screening tests available for these cancers that can reliably detect them at early stages. “Additionally, the risk factors for these cancers may not be as well-understood or easily identifiable as those for breast cancer, colon and cervical cancers.” Certain screening procedures may also be invasive and pose potential risks that do not justify the benefits of screening an entire population. For example, the current methods to assess the pancreas is through “very invasive” scopes or computed tomography (CT) scans, which comes with radiation, Dr Ow said. In Singapore, pancreatic cancer is the 10th most common cancer among men and ninth most common one among women. However, its aggressive nature makes it the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths here. Dr Ow said: “You can argue that a colonoscopy (that screens for colon cancer) is very invasive, but the frequency that we do a colonoscopy is typically about every 10 years. And so, that's sort of worth it because we know the continuum is long. “But for an organ like the pancreas, we don't know what the continuum is. Do we offer this yearly? Can we offer this half yearly? “Also, how do we get tissues from the pancreas? We will have to do a biopsy through a scope. You can imagine that there's this invasiveness, potential harm, side effects and so forth.” Dr Ow also said that apart from the potential medical risks, unnecessary invasive screening procedures can affect people psychologically and can be cost- and time-consuming. There is also now evidence to suggest that screening may sometimes detect cancers that are very slow-growing, or indolent, that may not actually require any treatment, Dr Tanujaa said. For some slow-growing cancers, the treatment strategy may be just watchful waiting, which means to closely monitor the patient without giving any treatment until changes occur, Dr Ow said. “Studies have shown that if you do autopsies of elderly men, many of them may have had prostate cancer but they (did not) die of it. “So that's why there's something called ‘a lead-time bias’, because we don't know whether or not some cancers picked up by tests can affect lifespan or affect quality of life. Prostate cancer that is slow-growing is (an example),” he explained. Lead-time bias occurs when screening finds a cancer earlier, but the earlier diagnosis does not change the course of the disease. The current national screening recommendations for cervical, breast and colon cancer apply to people with average risks and no symptoms. For those with more risk factors, extra or early screening may be appropriate. “Individuals with a strong family history of certain cancers may benefit from starting cancer screening at an earlier age or undergoing more frequent screening than the general population,” Dr Tanujaa said, adding that the decision should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider. For instance, women with a family history of breast cancer, especially if it involves first-degree relatives such as a mother or sister, may be advised to start mammography screening at an earlier age than the general population. Dr Tanujaa said that it is generally recommended to start breast cancer screening 10 years younger than the first-degree relative was when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Genetic counselling and testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may be recommended for those with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, she advised. People with a family history of colorectal cancer or certain hereditary syndromes, such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis, may also need to begin colorectal cancer screening earlier than the recommended age of 50. This may involve starting colonoscopy screening in their 40s or even earlier, depending their family history and genetic testing results, Dr Tanujaa said. Another example is liver cancer screening for people with a history of liver cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B infection. Some screening packages include a panel of tumour-marker tests that claim to be able to detect certain cancers early. However, relying on such tests to screen for cancer can potentially do more harm than good. Dr Tanujaa said that tumour-marker tests measure certain substances in the blood, urine or tissue that can be elevated in the presence of cancer. “While they can be useful in some specific situations such as monitoring the response to cancer treatment or detecting cancer recurrence in individuals already diagnosed with cancer, they are generally not recommended for routine cancer screening in asymptomatic individuals,” she added. Dr Look from PanAsia Surgery said that due to its low sensitivity, cancer markers are not useful as a cancer screening test. “Cancer markers can be totally normal even in a patient with a very advanced cancer, and it may give a false sense of security in assuring the patient that he or she doesn’t have cancer. “Cancer markers can also be elevated due to non-cancer causes, causing a false sense of alarm when they are used for general screening,” he added. It helps to understand your personal health history before you put a chunk of money down for screening tests. “Knowing your family history of cancer, previous cancer diagnoses and other relevant medical conditions can help individuals assess their own risk factors for specific types of cancer,” Dr Tanujaa said. She also advised people to educate themselves on the recommended screening guidelines, based on age, gender and other risk factors. They may consult their healthcare providers to get more personalised recommendations. Dr Ow from the Singapore Cancer Society said that it is also important to follow the recommended screening schedule, or as advised by a doctor. “(Cancer screening schedules) are not static,” he said. “For example, for HPV and Pap smears, the schedule may be between every three and five years, but there’s also an adapted strategy. “If there are some slight changes that need to be followed up on, it may not be three to five years later; it may be six to 12 months.\" And just because you go for a screening once under the recommended guidelines and the results are normal, it does not mean that you can stop doing the checks forever and do not keep up the schedule for the next check. It is not a one-time-only thing. Dr Ow said: “We have patients with abnormal mammogram (findings) who did a biopsy, found out that it’s benign, everything’s normal, and that's the last mammogram they went for (and they do not do it again) because they felt that everything was okay.\" For the Screen for Life programme available to Singaporeans and permanent residents, go to its website for more information.

Wasps building a nest on a tree branch. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — A 60-year-old man was cycling along a park connector in Sembawang when he was attacked by hornets . He later died from the stings. At a coroner’s inquiry into the incident that happened in 2022, the court heard that the cause of death was multi-organ failure following the insect stings, as well as ischaemic heart disease. Similar cases of insect stings turning deadly have been reported in the past: Although such fatal incidents are rare, insect stings can be a hazard. Data from the National University Hospital (NUH) showed that last year, a total of 265 patients were seen for insect bites or stings at its emergency medicine department and children’s emergency. Three quarters of the cases were children. Five patients — one child and four adults — required hospital admission for further treatment. Over at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), its allergy service has seen 21 patients with insect venom allergy of all severities in the past five years. TODAY spoke to doctors and experts who study insects to find out why some insect stings lead to bad effects and how to stay safe. 1. THEY ARE THREATENED AND DEFENDING THEMSELVES Insects such as hornets, wasps and bees usually sting in self-defence when they feel threatened or are provoked. Biologist Carl Baptista has had some “close shaves” when he accidentally disturbed nests during fieldwork, but understanding insect behaviour helped mitigate risks. “Quick withdrawal and avoiding sudden movements helped prevent stings,” he added. Mr Baptista is the founder and chief technology officer of Cuprina Holdings, a biomedical and biotechnology firm where the flagship product is a bio-dressing made of live medical-grade maggots . Insects might sting also if someone provokes them in some way. Nests or hives are usually disturbed unintentionally, which causes the insects to go into an “alert” mode. “Even if one of the alerted insects is disturbed, the rest of the hive can be called (to home in on the threat),” Mr Baptista said. 2. THEY ARE GUARDING TERRITORY Entomologist Moo Chee Yuan from Cuprina said that walking close to a nest may increase the risk of being stung since these insects are protective of their territory. Insects may also go into an “alert” mode if a branch falls on their nest or hive, when grass is cut or pruned, or when mosquito fogging is carried out. However, unprovoked attacks are rare unless a nest is disturbed or the insects feel threatened by human presence. Dr Jonathan Tang, a clinical toxicologist who practises at NUH and Alexandra Hospital, has seen his share of patients who had suffered from insect stings. The consultant at NUH’s emergency medicine department and a specialist emergency physician said: Among these stinging insects, hornets are particularly notorious for their aggressive behaviour and potent venom, Mr Moo the entomologist said. The man who died in 2022 was stung by hornets. Insect stings can be fatal when they trigger: Dr Tan Sze-Chin, a senior consultant at TTSH’s department of rheumatology, allergy and immunology, said that when anaphylaxis happens, the person \"experiences profound low blood pressure or circulatory collapse; or the airway swells up and results in suffocation”. However, deaths due to stings by Hymenoptera insects are “exceedingly rare”, Dr Tang from NUH said. 1. PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECEIVED A TOXIC DOSE OF VENOM A significant dose of toxic venom would involve multiple stings — more than 50 to 100. It is not just one to two stings, Dr Tang from NUH said. However, he pointed out that an allergic reaction can occur even at lower doses of venom since it is the human body’s immune response. 2. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN BITTEN OR STUNG BEFORE, OR HAVE EXISTING ALLERGIES Anaphylaxis more commonly occurs in patients who have been exposed to bee venom in the past and in those with a history of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (nasal symptoms of runny or blocked nose triggered by allergens), eczema and asthma . Their immune system is already sensitised, making them more prone to severe reactions when they are re-exposed to the allergen. Dr Tan from TTSH said that the risk of a serious allergic reaction can increase by up to 58 per cent if there was already a sting within the last two months. The increased risk applies even if the first sting was well-tolerated. Bee stings also result in more serious allergic reactions in people with insect venom allergy, compared to wasp stings. 3. ADULTS AND THOSE WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS Allergic reactions tend to be more serious in adults than children, Dr Tan said. Other risk factors include having certain medical conditions such as lung and heart diseases, and being on certain medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which are used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems. “While the exact reason (why adults get more severe allergic reactions from insect stings) is not defined, it is postulated that older individuals frequently suffer from co-existing heart and lung problems that impair the body’s ability to recover from a reaction,” Dr Tan added. If a wasp nest or bee hive is found near or in the home, people should not try to remove it themselves. Contact a professional pest control service for assistance. Avoid wearing strong fragrances, perfumes or highly scented cosmetics, Dr Tan said. If you have left an opened drink can or bottle unattended while outdoors, check before drinking to prevent being stung inside the mouth because insects are drawn to sweet beverages. As for people who have had an allergic reaction to insect stings, be prepared with an allergy action plan and have the necessary standby treatment on hand. “They should carry an EpiPen (containing adrenaline) that can be administered immediately if necessary. Such patients should also be reviewed by an allergy specialist,” Dr Tang from NUH said. During their fieldwork, Mr Baptista and Mr Moo from Cuprina use insect repellent and are generally cautious around insect nests and habitats — something that they also ask the general public to do when outdoors. “My advice to readers is to be aware of your surroundings, especially in nature, and avoid disturbing insects and their nests. “Knowing how to react to a sting and when to seek medical help is also essential,” Mr Baptista said. What you can do: 1. Move to a safe location to prevent further stings. 2. Do not “suck the venom out” of a bite or sting site, be they from insects, snakes or spiders. This risks soft tissue injury. “Don’t believe what you see on TV,” Dr Tang said. 3. Try removing the stinger to reduce the venom load — but do this by scraping it away with a sideways movement using a card or fingernail. “Avoid pinching or squeezing the stinger because this may force more venom to be injected into the wound,” Dr Tang added. 4. Wash the affected area with soap and water, and apply a cold pack to reduce swelling and pain, Mr Baptista advised. Take antihistamines for itching and swelling, if necessary. The human body's reactions to insect stings can vary widely. Dr Tang said that the majority of people usually have a mild local reaction that is self-limiting, including pain, swelling and redness over the affected site, which usually resolves within 24 hours. “Larger local reactions (swelling of more than 10cm) can take up to a week to fully subside.” Dr Tan from TTSH said that most patients who suffer allergic reactions frequently have skin symptoms such as itch, flushing, wheals, eye or lip swelling. However, if there is toxic envenomation, it usually results in damage to the internal organs and requires blood investigations to diagnose and monitor. “It is difficult to predict if an insect sting will be uneventful (apart from pain and minor swelling at the sting site) or whether a reaction will develop. “Therefore, individuals who have been stung should be vigilant for any evolving signs or symptoms that might suggest a reaction. “It is advisable they stop what they are doing immediately and move to an area where help is readily available, should any reaction develop,” Dr Tan added. Dr Tang said that there is no antidote to reverse the effects of venom. People who get emergency help at hospitals will be assessed for how severe the reaction is and whether there is any immediate threat to life, the doctors said. Treatment ranges from removing stingers to getting patients to take anti-histamines and corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory medication). Patients will be observed for six hours and discharged if they have no symptoms, Dr Tang added. For cases of toxic envenomation, supportive care is the main treatment. “(These patients) will be managed in the intensive care unit for organ support till recovery. For example, dialysis for kidney failure, medications to support blood pressure.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Singapore SINGAPORE — On Oct 31 in 2000, three-year-old Diyana Amir was at home when the SQ006 plane crash that killed 83 of the 179 people onboard happened. Please be advised that the articles delve into trauma-related topics that may be triggering to the reader. SINGAPORE — On Oct 31 in 2000, three-year-old Diyana Amir was at home when the SQ006 plane crash that killed 83 of the 179 people onboard happened. Her father Amir Husin, who had been a cabin crew member then, survived the aviation disaster. The ill-fated Singapore Airlines Boeing 747-400 plane carrying 159 passengers and 20 crew members — some of whom were Singaporeans — was to fly to Los Angeles, United States from Taipei, Taiwan. During take-off at around 11.20pm, the plane hit construction equipment, fell back onto the runway, broke apart and burst into flames. Four crew members and 78 passengers died. Another passenger died from severe burns days later. The tragedy would go on to change Ms Diyana’s childhood. Once “the playful parent” she looked to for fun activities, her father became solemn and reserved after that, isolating himself in a room at home most of the time. Despite her young age then, she sensed that something had changed drastically. Now aged 23, the entertainment producer and filmmaker has written and directed a short film called Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar — inspired by her childhood experience living with her father’s post-traumatic stress. She told TODAY: “My mother, the only adult at home, and I were constantly vigilant and alert. “We had to halt our daily routines because certain triggers, like the smell of fire or a lit gas stove while cooking, the scent of frangipanis or even my baby brother crying, would set my dad off, leading to anger, irritation or aggression.” The scent of frangipanis was linked to the burial, funerals and deaths of her dad’s friends and colleagues. She added: “As a child, it took me a while to comprehend and accept the change in him.” Growing up with a parent who was mentally unwell, she recalled the difficult period during her childhood: “Unlike my friends who spent their days playing, I found myself taking a more mature role early, supporting my mother and caring for my little brother. “At the time, it felt unfair, a childhood somewhat ‘lost’.” Even though this experience is deeply personal, Ms Diyana’s early struggles with adversity are not uncommon. Every two in three adults in Singapore have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience in their lives before the age of 18. This was among the key findings of a study here published in the Child Abuse and Neglect Journal in 2020 — the first Singapore study on adverse childhood experiences. The study was part of the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016 conducted by researchers at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) . The term “adverse childhood experience” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up. Living with a household member who is mentally unwell is just one example. Research into potentially traumatic events in childhood has highlighted their far-reaching harmful effects, which may persist well into adulthood. However, not all types of adverse experiences are obviously traumatic, and not every child is affected in the same way. Some may be able to manage the situation, whereas others require support and help. Adjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung , chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), said: “For example, when you’re young and you have an illness that keeps you in hospital for two months. \"You recover from the illness but that separation from your family could be quite traumatic, and may have repercussions in the longer term. “That can also be considered potentially traumatic although on the surface, it doesn't appear toxic, but that could potentially be a traumatic event.” In the 2016 IMH study, the most prevalent adverse childhood experience reported was emotional neglect. Around 46 per cent of the adult respondents experienced this. This was followed by: Childhood emotional neglect is when the child’s emotional needs are consistently overlooked, ignored or not adequately met by their caregivers during the formative years. When asked what emotional neglect might look like in families, Dr Fung from IMH said: “In today's Singapore context, it would mean that there might be adults around but they are not providing (love and) care for the child.” In a separate study by the Singapore Children’s Society, which surveyed 270 pairs of caregivers and children from low-income families from 2017 to 2019, the common adverse childhood experiences the children faced were: Ms Toh Sze Min, a research officer with the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “As the sample of children were from low-income families, some possible reasons where these adverse childhood experiences were common could be that children from these families might have lived in neighbourhoods that were less safe. “They might have been bullied in school because they were not able to fit in with their peers due to the family’s low income. “Individuals in multi-stressed populations were more vulnerable and at higher risk of offending behaviours that may lead to (serving time in prison).” Dr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with the department of child development at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) , said that exposure to adverse experiences during the critical early years of life can have significant and lasting effects on cognitive development, and how the person regulates behaviour and emotions. “These can contribute to difficulties in learning, social interactions and ultimately, have an impact on educational and employment outcomes in the long term.” Left unchecked, experiencing hardships in childhood can cause toxic stress. Clinical psychologist Claire Ng said that while some level of stress can be “healthy for development”, stress that is unrelenting, pervasive and overwhelming becomes detrimental. “Psychological stress is considered ‘extreme’ when it overwhelms the child’s internal capacity and inner resources to cope,” she added. Ms Ng is with the department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services at IMH. Likening extreme stress to a car engine that is revved up for long periods every day, Ms Ng explained: “Eventually, it results in wear and tear that heightens the risk of stress-related physical health issues. “This (type of stress) is particularly problematic for children as they are undergoing critical developmental periods. “Toxic stress can affect the brain’s developing structure. This means it doesn’t just affect the child’s current well-being, it also has lasting effects on their capacity to tolerate stressors in the future.” For example, children who were maltreated were found to have: Findings from research into the long-term health effects are just as troubling. “Exposure to adverse childhood experiences increases the chance of health problems in adulthood, ranging from cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancers, mental health problems, among others,” Dr Padmini from KKH said. Ms Toh from Singapore Children’s Society said that findings from its aforementioned 2017 to 2019 study have shown that children who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences tended to have “poorer life satisfaction, school engagement and social-emotional competence”. New research based on a nationwide sample of more than 25,000 pairs of twins in Sweden reinforced this. The Swedish study found that the effects of adverse childhood experience were “dose-dependent”, with each additional adverse experience associated with 52 per cent greater odds of any psychiatric disorder later in life. The study was published in the Jama Psychiatry peer-reviewed journal last month. The IMH study found that experiencing just one adverse childhood experience placed the person at a considerably higher risk (3.7 times more likely) of developing a mood or anxiety disorder, compared to those whose childhood were unblemished by an adverse event. Those with an adverse childhood experience was also 4.2 times more likely to have suicidal thoughts, and plan and attempt suicide . The effects of an adverse childhood experience may not end with the victim: Past trauma can affect subsequent relationships and leave an imprint across generations. Ms Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service at Singapore Children’s Society, said that parents who have experienced childhood trauma themselves may normalise adverse experiences or struggle to recognise that there are healthier alternatives for their children. “They may unknowingly perpetuate patterns of trauma within the family and expose their children to similar adversities,” she added. Dr Fung from IMH said that intergenerational transmission of abuse can result in changed behaviour and perception of what normal relationships are. “For example, for someone who has been coercively abused , whether physical or sexual, they may view relationships as centred around satisfying the needs of the more powerful caregiver. “When they become caregivers themselves, they may relive that kind of trauma on the next generation, becoming abusers themselves . “If you study paedophilia and other kinds of sexual disorders called paraphilias, there often is a history of some level of abuse of a similar nature in the childhood, though not all (have experienced childhood abuse),” he added. Ms Ng the clinical psychologist wanted to stress that not all abuse victims go on to become perpetrators themselves. “Many victims go on to thrive and experience post-traumatic growth (positive changes after exposure to trauma) where they go on to live meaningful lives.” Not everyone who has had a rough childhood suffers irreparable damage, but the potential fallout is significant enough such that researchers and experts are working to find ways to mitigate its effects. In Singapore, there are programmes and interventions in place to support traumatised children. (More details will be available in the second part of this series.) Experts told TODAY that it is crucial to address adverse childhood experiences and provide appropriate intervention as early as possible. “Trauma-focused work with children often requires working close with families and communities. “A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” Ms Ng said. Dr Fung said that education is key. Understanding what would potentially traumatise a child and its potential impact are an important preventative step. So is the presence of safe, secure, nurturing relationships in the child’s life, particularly when times are tough. “Even if a child has gone through a potentially traumatic situation, providing a safe, secure and nurturing environment is actually protective,” Dr Fung said. “Suppose there’s an accident and the child (is the sole survivor). Can you still save the child (from potential long-term effects of trauma)? “Yes, you can, if there’s a caregiver who loves them. Maybe a grandparent who can keep them safe, nurture them and help them process what has happened.” Mr Jeremy Heng, senior clinical psychologist and deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children, said: “From what we know from research and our work at Children’s Society, the other most important factor is having one consistent safe attachment adult figure, or more, in the child’s life.” Despite his mental health struggles after surviving the plane crash, Mr Amir’s love for his family came through later. A combination of medical intervention, therapy sessions and unwavering support from family and friends helped him and his family heal. Ms Diyana said: “There wasn’t a singular defining moment that marked the turning point in my dad’s recovery. “Instead, it was more of a gradual realisation, a click of understanding that I had observed in him that resonated deeply with me. “Slowly but surely, we began seeing glimpses of his old self returning.” This was about two years after the disaster. She recalled that their relationship improved when she was around five years old. In the short film Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar, Ms Diyana tried to capture that subtle yet profound shift with a scene of her family huddling together after a storm. “It symbolised not just the aftermath of a literal storm but also the emotional and psychological challenges we had weathered together,” she said. “It felt as if my dad suddenly saw us and understood that he wasn’t alone, that we were all there, willing to support him through his struggles. “That realisation seemed to act as a catalyst for him to begin opening up, allowing himself to be vulnerable and to lean on us as he took steps towards recovery.” Today, the family has not just “moved on” from the experience; they grew and became stronger as a unit. “My relationship with my dad is better than ever now. It’s evolved into something truly special… open, fun and deeply connected. “We enjoy each other’s company and we find joy in the simplest of moments together,” Ms Diyana said. Her father’s battle with adversity shaped her own approach to handling life’s challenges. She recalled feeling scared whenever her baby brother cried because that would trigger her father. She would also put on a brave front and help out at home, such as fold her own school uniform. Looking back, she realised that she ended up spending more time at home after the incident, and that made her closer to her mother and little brother. She said that she never felt resentful or bitter. To her, it felt like they were all going through a difficult situation together. It taught her the value of patience and understanding. Instead of reacting impulsively in times of adversity, it was crucial to pause, reflect and look past the surface of the problem, she added. “With hindsight, I see the immense impact it had on my personal growth. The experience accelerated my maturity, equipping me with a depth of understanding and empathy that has been invaluable through my teenage years and into adulthood. “It taught me to navigate complex situations and understand people beyond the surface,” she said. She also saw how important open communication was in overcoming hard times. “I’ve come to realise that trying to navigate trauma or any problems in isolation only amplifies the pain and can hinder healing. Speaking up and confiding in people I trust has been important. “It’s a reminder that sharing our burdens doesn’t make us weaker but opens the door to support and insight.” That was why she made the film. “Making the film was not just a creative outlet for me, but a deliberate effort to communicate and connect (with people) on issues often shrouded in silence. “My hope is that by sharing these stories, we can illuminate the shared aspects of our human experience, encourage others to speak up, seek support and find solace in the fact that they are not alone.” Paper Planes, Don’t Always Soar will screen at an Institute of Mental Health event next Saturday (April 20) from 10.30am to 12.15pm. Ms Diyana Amir, Dr Daniel Fung, Ms Claire Ng and other mental health experts will discuss the impact of intergenerational trauma on youth mental health. Admission is free.

    "article_content": "Singapore This audio is AI-generated. Please be advised that the articles delve into trauma-related topics that may be triggering to the reader. SINGAPORE — Adverse childhood experiences are potentially traumatic events that occur in a child’s life before the age of 18. Some of them are harmful and obvious when there is abuse and maltreatment. Others are less apparent but equally traumatic such as enduring pain from an injury or prolonged hospitalisation, not fitting in among peers and emotional neglect from parents. In children and teenagers who are still growing physically, cognitively and emotionally, these early adverse experiences can leave a negative imprint on their development, behaviour and health right into adulthood. In an ideal world, every child will grow up safe, loved and supported. Yet, painful and distressing experiences are sometimes unavoidable, and not every child has the inner resources and capacity to bounce back on their own from the shock or hurt. So what are the signs to watch for in children and teenagers who are traumatised? And what can be done to help them recover from an adverse childhood experience or traumatic event? One thing is clear and especially crucial: The presence of a safe and nurturing environment and equivalent relationships. Just one consistent adult figure who can provide love and care is the key to help them start healing. However, an important step is to first acknowledge the occurrence of a traumatic experience, because healing cannot begin in silence or denial. Adjunct Associate Professor Daniel Fung , chief executive officer of the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) , said: “We need to recognise that there was a potentially traumatic event and help the child to deal with it. “There’s a saying that a burden shared is a burden halved. “I've seen a number of children where the parents are really in denial of something that has happened in the family when it's clear that there was abuse. And that’s painful for the child.” Although different children may process a traumatic event differently, some tell-tale signs to pay attention to are: Research from the Singapore Children’s Society found that having one or more consistent, safe attachment adult figure in the child’s life can help the child bounce back after adversity . In the absence of parents, these adults may be other family members, family friends, school counsellors, teachers , befrienders, mentors or neighbours. What if parents or immediate family cannot provide support or continue to be the source of trauma , for example, in cases of child abuse or ill-treatment ? Senior clinical psychologist Jeremy Heng said that in such cases, professional agencies such as Family Service Centres and the Child Protective Service under the Ministry of Social and Family Development will work with other adults in the child’s life to establish safety. He added: “Having someone who trusts in you, who tells you that whatever negative things that have happened is not your fault, that you are safe, are loved and wanted, that you belong, are good enough and that the future is hopeful. “These messages help ground a child and give them an opportunity to develop healthily and thrive in spite of their adverse childhood experiences.” Mr Heng is the deputy head of Sunbeam Place at Singapore Children’s Society, a residential home for abused and neglected children. There, for example, the residential care workers are parental figures for many of the young residents. Not only do they provide care, they also gently guide them to correct their mistakes using “teachable moments”. Mr Heng illustrated how it often takes a village to support traumatised children: An eight-year-old was referred to Sunbeam Place after prolonged harsh physical punishment and emotional rejection by her parents. When she was first admitted, her intense emotional and behavioural outbursts often meant that she was biting, punching and scratching the staff members. A group people were roped in to give the necessary support: A psychologist, residential care workers, a child development team and social workers. “Currently, the teenager (now aged 14) is thriving in secondary school and is vice-captain for her sports co-curricular activity. She copes well with distress and relational conflicts, using her preferred emotional regulation strategies,” Mr Heng said. “She also encourages and takes care of younger residents (at Sunbeam Place)who struggle with managing their difficult emotions because they remind her of her younger self. “Most importantly, she is going home to her family in the next few months because both the professionals and her family have expressed confidence in a safe and stable reunification.” Referring to Singapore Children’s Society’s research, Mr Heng said that when children who perceived that they had no one or only a few people whom they can turn to for emotional support, those who were exposed to more adverse childhood experiences had more of what is known as “internalising problems”, which are the feelings that develop internally such as anxiety, social withdrawal and depression. When they perceived that they had more people to turn to, they were less likely to experience these feelings. Mr Heng said that receiving the appropriate intervention after a traumatic event is critical. This is to ensure that the child feels safe and is not in immediate danger or harm. It helps the child make sense of what has happened and reduce the likelihood of psychological troubles later. “No other intervention may be effective if the harm continues,” he added. Clinical psychologist Claire Ng from IMH said that trauma-focused work with children often involves working closely with families and communities. “A large part of the work is helping children and families understand the impact of trauma on children,” she said. “This helps families develop empathy for the child who may have difficulties regulating their emotions and behaviour after experiencing trauma. “Another important part of the work is also helping caregivers understand how to help the child feel safe, both physically and emotionally.” Ms Ng is with IMH’s department of developmental psychiatry and the forensic rehabilitation, intervention, evaluation and network development services (Friends). Trauma Systems Therapy is one form of therapy used that actively involves the caregivers and communities to support the child: An approach called Trauma-informed Positive Behavioural Interventions and Supports (TI-PBIS) is used in the residential care setting at Sunbeam Place under the Singapore Children’s Society. It is a system of care that equips children with adaptive behaviours that help them regulate their emotions and form positive social connections. To promote social connections, each of its six dormitories is set up to resemble a typical Singaporean household, with a living room, study room and bedrooms. The residents have daily routines and activities that are mundane but critical in promoting positive behaviour and social interaction, Mr Heng said. For example, having meals together and sharing about their day, deciding on activities to do as a group and studying together. Besides letting the residents feel they are safe and loved, can trust others and have control, the recurring positive interactions allow them to “unlearn” maladaptive interaction patterns such as being aggressive to protect themselves, and to learn healthier ways to relate to others. “They also learn skills to tolerate distress and regulate themselves using more effective and healthier methods. “This is why having one or more consistent safe and trusted adult attachment figures is so critical to scaffold, guide and promote the learning of necessary skills to support the recovery of these children and youth,” Mr Heng explained. In Singapore, various programmes are in place to support traumatised children. The following are just a few of them. 1. INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH 2. SINGAPORE CHILDREN’S SOCIETY Ms Ang Jia Yi, a counsellor at Yishun Family Service under the Singapore Children’s Society, said: “The aim is to reduce the likelihood of individuals developing more severe distress and trauma symptoms. The majority of them return to normalcy with adequate support.” 3. KK WOMEN’S AND CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL Dr Yeleswarapu Padmini, senior consultant with KKH’s department of child development, said: “(Information on) the history of non-accidental injuries could come from one of the parents, community agency supporting the family or from preschool if they have identified any signs and symptoms suggestive of any non-accidental injuries. “At the same time, a detailed evaluation of the child and information gathered by the medical social worker as part of the social evaluation would also be considered.” Dr Padmini added that children who are exposed to adverse childhood experiences often come from families that have competing needs. These may include financial concerns or the child’s caregiver could have mental health ailments. One of the advantages of receiving help through the Anchor programme is that the interventions are carried out in the family's home. The team — consisting of various professionals — comes up with individualised plans to address the specific challenges that the child and family have. For example, children exposed to a significant traumatic event will get support from a psychologist who can provide more trauma-focused interventions. For children with health or developmental problems, they will be supported by paediatricians and allied health professionals. Ms Ng from IMH said that humans are innately wired to seek connection and learn about themselves, others and the world through the eyes of their early caregivers. “If a child can rely on safe, reliable caregivers to meet their needs, they develop a mental model of the world as a safe place. “This perception of a secure base allows them to explore the world with confidence, develop healthy relationships, manage setbacks effectively and so on,” she explained. Understanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences and the struggles that families face spurred Morning Star Community Services to launch a free evening “drop-in” service in 2016. The child may be dropped off at the centre where it runs its CareNights programme, which supports lower-income families in need who require care for their children on weekday nights. This gives parents time at night for work or to take courses to improve their skills. This also allows them to get a respite for families going through a difficult time such as those undergoing divorce or attending to critically ill family members. CareNights also conduct parenting workshops and organise parent-child bonding activities such as outings and birthday celebrations for children who attends CareNights and their families. A large proportion of families that place their children with CareNights are single-parent households. It currently supports 63 children across four centres. Mr Lemuel Yanos Baculanta, the programme’s assistant manager, said: “Supporting parents is crucial in addressing and mitigating adverse childhood experiences because parents play a vital role in shaping a child’s environment and experiences.” As for the children, the programme’s aim is also to provide a secure and nurturing environment for them where they feel secure and accepted, and are heard and understood. A recent case that Mr Baculanta encountered is an eight-year-old girl, whose father was put up at a nursing home due to deteriorating dementia. He had shown verbally violent behaviour. The mother, the sole breadwinner in the family, works extra hours at night and during weekends to make ends meet. Confused and frustrated by the changes, the girl confided in a CareNights mentor that she had thoughts of self-harm and was curious about a “happy pill” (presumed to be a drug) that she had discovered while watching content fromYouTube. The mentor immediately advised the child’s mother to limit the girl’s access to such online content . After learning about her daughter’s thoughts of self-harm, the mother also communicated the self-harm concerns to the school counsellor. Emphasising the importance of having trusted adults in the child’s life to buffer the impact of adverse childhood experiences, Mr Baculanta said: “Currently, the child is thriving and starting to express joyfulness despite her family situation. She feels more confident and secure, knowing that there are people (CareNights’ mentors and volunteers) aside from her family who are concerned for her well-being.” Dr Fung from IMH said that even with such an ecosystem around a child, and social agencies and organisations may be able to provide tangible help and support, they still cannot provide the love that families can give. “There’s a need for love, but love is not something that I can prescribe, though I wish I could,” the child psychiatrist added. In 2021, a traumatic injury left my daughter with mobility issues for over a year and a chronic pain condition. From a fit, healthy and cheerful teenager, my girl who was 14 then could not walk, run, jump or write without experiencing muscle spasms and pain. The unrelenting pain she experienced was more than physical; it took over every aspect of her life, weighing her down mentally and emotionally. Post-traumatic stress symptoms set in: The cold sweats, being easily startled and flashbacks of the incident that led to her injury. Her sleep was disrupted either by pain or nightmares. In school, she struggled to make sense of the jeers and taunting from some classmates who labelled her “disabled” after seeing her hobble around using a crutch. One day, she told me, “Something in my brain tells me to kill myself. It is too painful”. It is the worst thing any parent could hear their child say. But I was also glad that my daughter, with whom I had a close bond, let me in on her innermost thoughts. They reflected how traumatised she was by her experiences. What I did after she disclosed her thoughts of suicide changed how she processed her traumatic experiences. I immediately raised the alarm with her medical team and asked for extra support from a psychologist. Therapy sessions were stepped up to help her cope with her pain flares. Instead of hushing up her mental health issues, I rallied extended family and friends. They took turns to visit, hang out, chat and prayed with her. With support, care and love, things improved over two years. My daughter developed a better understanding of herself and how to cope during times of stress, by using techniques such as deep-breathing and visualisation. She now aspires to work in healthcare to support other children and youth in need. Ms Claire Ng, a clinical psychologist from the Institute of Mental Health, said that there is consistent evidence to show that a child can thrive even after exposure to trauma — provided they have supportive, safe and nurturing environments. The brain, she explained, has the capacity to change and develop over a lifetime. “Just as negative experiences can affect brain development, corrective therapeutic experiences can have a profound impact on how a child develops after trauma,” Ns Ng added.

The women separately recalled a time when they lived in a state of tension, anxiety, stress and uncertainty, where personal security was almost non-existent in the midst of domestic upheavals. This audio is AI-generated. Please be advised that the articles delve into topics and accounts of trauma and abuse that may be triggering to the reader. SINGAPORE — Growing up, home was not a safe place for Singaporeans Sharon Khoo and Nanny Eliana. The women separately recalled a time when they lived in a state of tension, anxiety , stress and uncertainty, where personal security was almost non-existent in the midst of domestic upheavals. What does a child do when the very adults meant to protect and nurture them become the source of their nightmares? For Ms Eliana, 45, and Mrs Khoo, 39, they carried the weight of their difficult growing-up years into adulthood. Both women later sought professional help to equip them with the skills to rebuild their mental health that had suffered due to domestic violence . In conversations with TODAY, they bravely told of their adverse childhood experiences and how those early years shaped the course of their adult lives. The term “ adverse childhood experience ” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up. The first seven years of Mrs Sharon Khoo’s childhood was filled with good memories. She reminisced about the road trips to Malaysia with her parents, the joy of learning to ride a bicycle and playing hopscotch with her father. “Back then, my father was like my best friend. He was always the fun guy,” she said. Everything changed when she turned eight. Her father could not control his emotions and the fits of anger soon took over: He hit her when she could not answer mathematics problems or did not know how to do her homework. Looking back on his drastic behavioural change, Mrs Khoo said that it was probably due to financial strain and having to cope with the pressures of everyday living. As time passed, domestic violence set in and became frequent. He would beat his wife and eventually turned on their domestic worker as well. Recalling the nights filled with shouting, screaming and sounds of things being thrown around the house, Mrs Khoo said that it always felt like she was living on the edge of a “terrible disaster”. “It felt like I was living with a terrorist, like he wasn’t my dad anymore. I couldn’t understand why that was happening. “I was always fearful, always on edge and tense, not knowing when the next explosion from my dad was going to happen.” Apart from her own fears, she was worried for her younger sister who was just a two-year-old when her father started becoming abusive. She found no answers when she turned to her mother, who was also suffering but was seen from her young eyes as unwilling to stand up to her husband or leave him. “I cried with my mum and asked her what to do. But she told me, ‘Don’t you ever tell anyone about what's happening in our family’. I think there was a lot of shame,” Mrs Khoo added. Not being able to tell anyone about her family situation made her feel helpless and “trapped”. She remembered crying a lot. “No one taught me how to really take care of myself or respond to the situation. I recall being very depressed… and would just cry repeatedly. “I was so scared to go home after school that I would cry out to God. “Home was like a hell hole; I was scared that I was going to die in there.” At 14, after experiencing another episode of her father’s verbal and physical abuse, something snapped. She plucked up the courage and headed towards the police station, even though her mother had warned her not to get her father into trouble. The mother was worried that he would go to jail and they would be in financial difficulty. “This was despite both my parents working and earning incomes. When I heard that, I told my mum that she couldn’t keep doing that and enabling the abuse,” Mrs Khoo recounted. After telling the police officer what had happened, a personal protection order was filed against her father. “I was very relieved and grateful to the officer who was very kind. He told me to keep (the report) and if my dad ever hit me again, to return and report it. “That gave me the assurance that okay, someone’s still taking care of me. When I stepped out of the police station, my dad was actually standing outside. “He was very sombre, quiet and didn’t dare talk to me or make eye contact. “I felt really terrible because that was not what I wanted to do to my dad. I love my parents.” That moment of courage brought her some relief, because he never used physical violence on her again. By then, though, the traumatic experiences had left a profound impact on the teenager, who developed suicidal thoughts and self-harm tendencies. Feeling helpless, “stuck and alone”, she wanted the pain to stop. She was still living in a toxic environment because even though the physical abuse stopped, the verbal and emotional abuse continued. At 22, she got married to Mr Joshua Khoo and they had their first child a few years later when she was 25. Up to the time she got pregnant, she was still wrestling with dark thoughts and persistent low moods. “When I found out that I was pregnant, I cried and told myself that no matter what, I’m determined not to let my daughter suffer the way that I did. It is her existence in my life that led me to go see a psychiatrist.” After her consultations, she was diagnosed with clinical depression and complex traumatic stress disorder. People who have this form of traumatic stress disorder usually have experienced long-term trauma. It develops over months or years rather than over a single event, where there were repeated occasions where the victims had little control and were unable to escape their situation. Supported by a Christian counsellor, a psychiatrist and a psychologist who kickstarted her healing process, Mrs Khoo underwent a combination of therapy and medications. She was also supported by her husband, church mates and her faith, which eventually lifted the fog. During this period, when her daughter turned one year old in 2010, the family of three moved to Thailand, drawn by a shared desire to do missionary work. Her firstborn is now 14 years old and her younger daughter is aged 10. The Khoo family continues to call Thailand home, returning to Singapore once a year for social visits. As part of her healing journey, Mrs Khoo wrote a book about the childhood experiences that her mother had told her to keep to herself. Titled Hope in Despair, it chronicles her journey in overcoming clinical depression, complex traumatic stress disorder and the deep emotional wounds she sustained from domestic abuse. Despite her initial hesitation of “putting myself out there”, hearing news of people dying by suicide spurred her to tell her story. She hopes that it would help others going through similar adversities. Mrs Khoo said that she has forgiven both her parents, but still has some ways to go in reconciling with her father. “I love my parents and have no animosity with them. There were so many times I felt so bad for them, and so saddened and ashamed of what had happened to our family.” When asked what was her parents’ reaction to her book, Mrs Khoo said that they did not object to it. Her mother had told her that she felt ashamed and guilty for what had happened. Her father had also apologised to her after the birth of her firstborn, but reconciliation has not been easy. She requested that he sought professional help, but he declined. There were occasions when he was verbally abusive in front of her daughter, such that Mrs Khoo and her husband had to draw boundaries and not meet him in person to maintain their family’s safety. For example, they would not meet both her parents together because that tended to trigger fighting and disagreements. “I learned that forgiving him is one thing but reconciling is another,” she added. “Just because you forgive, it doesn't mean you will have an okay relationship with the person who hurt you. “If the person doesn’t know how to change or won’t actively seek professional help to change, he or she will just fall back on old habits and patterns.” Her psychiatrist had commented that her father seemed to display symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Narcissistic personality disorder leads to egoistical behaviour and lack of empathy, while borderline personality disorder affects one’s ability to manage emotions. Both personality disorders may involve dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behaviours, and interfere with how they relate to other people. “But it was also definitely his unwillingness to be responsible for his own stress and frustration, and just letting it run free and wild in the house,” Mrs Khoo added. Mr and Mrs Khoo serve in The Acts Church of Chiang Mai in Thailand and have also ministered in other countries including Australia, Brunei and Cambodia. As a certified pastoral counsellor now, Mrs Khoo supports others being battered by their own storms. Learning to overcome childhood trauma has shaped her perspective on her family life, and she is immensely grateful to experience what it is like to have a loving family. Speaking of her husband and children, she said: “They are my greatest gift and achievement. With them, my family life is so different from the one I previously knew with my family of origin. “My husband and children had to bear with me during the early years and watch me come out of the pain. But once I managed to do that, we could finally have a functional, healthy and normal family life.” To others struggling with adversity and trauma , she wants to tell them that they are “worthy of care, love and all the right things in life”. “No matter how out of control your situation may be or how you feel now, you have the free will and power to choose how you want to respond to adversity . “No one, no abuser, bully or toxic situation can ever take away that power from you,” she asserted. As a childhood abuse survivor, Mrs Khoo understands the importance of self-love in healing wounds of the past. Rewriting a life story begins from within. “The most powerful, positive change is when you choose to love yourself, then you’ll do the right things for yourself and turn your life around.” Poised and articulate, Ms Nanny Eliana helms a medical and healthcare communications agency, which has offices in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. The Singaporean businesswoman also holds the position of chairperson of the Katong-Joo Chiat Business Association, which is a volunteer-led organisation that champions and supports the interests and welfare of business owners in the Katong and Joo Chiat area. Deep beneath her confident exterior, though, is a girl who never felt like she belonged anywhere. Born in 1979 as the youngest of three daughters, she was given up for adoption at two weeks old to a Singaporean couple when her family had financial difficulties. The early years of her childhood with her adoptive parents were relatively comfortable. Though strict, they provided material comforts and a stable family life. When Ms Eliana was nine years old, her adoptive mother who was a homemaker died from cancer. Her adoptive father, a civil servant, remarried about two years later. After her adoptive mother died, he became stricter. Spending her pre-adolescent and teenage years under her adoptive father’s harsh disciplinarian ways was rough. His explosive temper and rigid curfews created a tense atmosphere at home. “As a teenager at the time, it was impossible to have a conversation with him,” she recalled. “He was not able to regulate his emotions and would fly off the handle easily, throw things around the house, ground me. “He locked me out of the house several times.” Ms Eliana had some suspicion that she was adopted because she did not look like her adoptive family members. She never confirmed it until her adoptive father revealed the truth during a heated argument and told her to return to her biological family. She was 18 then. “Thrown back” to her biological family, the teenager had no choice but to start living with two older sisters, mother and father. Her father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Ms Eliana recalled that she could not really adapt to her new life, having lived in the comfort of her adoptive family’s five-room flat in a public housing block where she had her own bedroom. The shift to the cramped quarters of her biological family’s three-room flat meant that she had to share a bedroom with her adult older sisters. The lack of material comforts did not bother her as much as the lack of emotional connection and sense of safety. Her mentally ill biological father thought that she was returned to the family to murder him. Schizophrenia is a major psychotic illness where the sufferer is unable to tell what is real or unreal sometimes. The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, where the patient has an altered perception of reality. Patients have to take medication for symptoms of hallucinations that may include hearing voices, or of paranoia where they believe they are being followed or controlled, among other delusions. Ms Eliana’s father did not consistently take his medication, which would then lead to episodes of abnormal behaviour and violence. Recounting the times when her father punched her, she said: “I was caught unaware because he may be sitting quietly and suddenly, he would lunge at me. “Back then, he used to wear rings with big stones on them. And he would punch me till the stones dropped off the ring, and the metal part of the ring cut into the skin under my eye.” There were also times when he would charge at her with a knife. When that happens, she would lock herself in the bedroom. “My sisters will berate him, telling him that it’s wrong to do that. But the thing is, he had no control over it.” She added: “All I was thinking at the time was I needed to get out of there.” Despite their blood ties, Ms Eliana did not feel a close bond with her older siblings. There were also moments when she felt that she was not welcomed or wanted. “My sisters grew up together in hardship, so they were very close-knit. When I came into the picture, maybe they saw me as the ‘brat’, the third child who grew up in comfort, given the opportunity to go to university while they had to work to support the family.” The painful and isolating experiences at home notwithstanding, Ms Eliana graduated from university, with her school fees funded by her adoptive father through the national social security savings scheme that is the Central Provident Fund. Eager to build her career, she started work as a writer, only to realise that her working environment at the time caused her unnecessary stress. About a year after graduating from university, Ms Eliana began freelancing. She spent her waking hours outside home, writing at fast-food restaurants, meeting interviewees in their offices for fear that her mentally ill father would attack her. Tragedy struck again when her biological mother died in 2005 from a sudden illness. “She was literally the glue that held me to the family. So with her gone, the next thing I did was to move out,” Ms Eliana said. The following year, she got married. Around the same time, she was offered a small space in a shophouse in the Boat Quay area for S$200 a month that she turned into her office. She decided to build her own communications agency Bridges M&C, armed with a laptop bought with half a year’s worth of savings, a wall phone and dial-up internet. Her marriage did not work out and they divorced after she met someone else, her current husband. Ms Eliana admitted that a sense of safety and stability often eluded her. “I always felt like no one could support me and I had to be prepared to move or for things to change.” Her marriage to her second husband, who worked in corporate training at the time, had a tumultuous start. During the global financial recession in 2008, he lost all of his clients. Ms Eliana was still building her business then. She often found herself “feeling paralysed”. At the lowest point in her life, in 2011, she decided to get professional help. “By then, my life felt like a reset button, starting over again repeatedly. It felt like the choices I made often led me to dead ends.” Seeing a trauma therapist was the right move and Ms Eliana has kept up her appointments for the past 13 years. When asked if there was a turning point in her life, she did not remember any particular huge breakthroughs in her healing journey, saying that she is “still a work-in-progress”. “The ‘breaking free’ was incremental. It’s the little things like waking up and not feeling paralysed, and even when things happen, you are not overwhelmed by frustration or anger, such that you don’t make decisions in a way that doesn’t benefit you,” she added. “I was able to undo the belief that I couldn’t rely on anyone’s support. No matter how independent you are, how self-sufficient you are, we all need other people.” She did not get the support she needed from her adoptive or biological families, but Ms Eliana built her own network of support through her husband, friends and her long-time therapist. Even within her own business, she set the tone for a supportive environment so that her staff members have psychological safety. “People can say what they feel without being shot down and are not made to feel like they are disregarded.” The media and communications industry has its shares of high turnovers, but most of her employees have stuck around. One of them is celebrating his 10-year work anniversary this month. Ms Eliana has continued to keep in touch with her adoptive family, but lost touch with her biological family after they moved out of their old flat. “They have not reached out to me,” she said. Ms Eliana is hoping that her experience will help people with mental health troubles feel less alone in their struggles. She has also contributed to a literary anthology (a collection of literary works) called Letter to My Mother, where she wrote about how living with a father who has paranoid schizophrenia affected her family. “Being human is complex but there are ways for you to process your emotions if you get help. “I think people don’t realise that others might have also gone through the same experiences until they hear someone else talking about it.” Having benefited from therapy, she wants to encourage people to seek professional help. To her, it is important to continue “feeling”, even the difficult emotions, and learn the skills to process them in a healthy manner. “I’m able to experience more of the good stuff, like joy. I mean, how are you going to feel joy when you are wrapped up in anxiety, hurt and despair because that’s what you’re used to?” she asked. The constant and unhealthy hark-back to past wounds can become a stumbling block to healing. “Say, if my team decides to throw a birthday celebration for me, but in my head, all I'm thinking about is how I was hurt 10, 20 years ago, then I won’t be able to experience the support from the people around me.” Ms Eliana said that people like her who have gone through traumatic experiences often store in their minds what has happened long after the incidents. “There are people who may be 70 years old but their brains are still subconsciously stuck in pockets of trauma. I think therapy has helped me to process mine. “My experiences taught me that the only way out is to process the trauma. You have to work through it,” she advised. - To find the book Hope in Despair, go online here . - Letter to My Mother is sold at leading bookstores. - RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm) - Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm) - JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm) - The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm) Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This audio is AI-generated. Please be advised that the articles delve into topics and accounts of trauma and abuse that may be triggering to the reader. SINGAPORE — For victims of childhood trauma, letting go of resentment, anger or even hatred towards the people who have hurt them and inflicted deep wounds can be incredibly difficult. Yet, some people have found healing by practising forgiveness — mainly because they did not want to carry the burden anymore or because they did not want to make bad decisions or mistakes in life choices while being vulnerable or unstable mentally and emotionally. Forgiving her abuser, for example, helped 39-year-old Sharon Khoo heal and step away from her painful past. As a child, Mrs Khoo endured years of physical and emotional abuse by her father , and had no one to turn to as her mother tried to hush up the domestic violence. The traumatic experiences left a profound impact on her mental health during her teenage and young adult years, leading to multiple suicide attempts and self-inflicted harm . Reflecting on how holding on to anger and bitterness had made her a “bitter rage monster”, Mrs Khoo later realised that forgiveness was the only path to recovery. “My logical and adult mind said, ‘It’s better you don’t maintain any connections (with your father)’. “(But) I didn’t want to be a slave or prisoner to my bitterness anymore,” she said. Mental health experts told TODAY that forgiveness remains a deeply personal choice, but it can be an important part of the healing process for many people who have had adverse childhood experiences. The term “ adverse childhood experience ” refers to a potentially traumatic situation or event that a person may face or witness while growing up. Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, highlighted that the term “forgiveness” may imply reconciling with the offender and making peace with the person, but the interpretation in the psychology field differs. “In the psychological context, forgiveness denotes an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger, and in doing so, sealing off a past wrongdoing and removing it from the present,” he said. Crucial to forgiveness is accepting that the past experiences happened, and there is a deliberate effort to relinquish anger and stop the self-blame. “It also involves a commitment to moving forward and focusing on the present moment,” he added. Besides reducing the impact of past traumas and the symptoms of depression and anxiety , practising forgiveness can protect against intergenerational trauma, research showed. Intergenerational trauma occurs when victims of trauma repeat the patterns of abuse or violence within the family and expose their children to similar adversities. In a study published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Trauma in last December, researchers found that forgiveness is the “one personal protective factor that may disrupt the intergenerational transmission of adverse childhood experiences” and that this factor “is entirely within an individual’s control”. Based on a study of 150 parents and children combined, analyses revealed that if a parent had a higher number of adverse childhood experiences, this person’s child was likely to have a higher number of similar experiences. However, forgiveness seemed to weaken this connection, which led the researchers to hypothesise that “parents who showed higher levels of forgiveness of others and self-forgiveness would show a lesser tendency to pass adverse childhood experiences on to their children”. Forgiveness is also good for the heart, literally. Past research has shown that the deliberate decision to forgive is linked to a lower risk of a heart attack, reduced cholesterol levels and risk of other cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, people who are unable to forgive and let go may end up hurting themselves. That is because one of the psychological effects of holding on to grudges and resentment is increased stress and anxiety, which triggers the body’s stress response when prolonged, Dr BL Lim explained. “Holding onto deep-seated anger and resentment can be a contributing factor for the development of mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders and personality disorders,” he said. Persistent resentment can also lead to mistrust, conflict and isolation, making it difficult to form or maintain close relationships, he added. The experts emphasised that forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciliation. It certainly does not mean condoning and excusing the wrongful behaviour that had happened. “It is important to note that forgiveness is a personal journey and does not necessarily mean forgetting the events or fully reconciling with the offenders,” Dr Lim said. The idea that doing so is “virtuous can be a burdensome misconception” for people who have been wronged, he added. “Often, the inability to reconcile with the offender or treat them kindly can lead to feelings of guilt and self-criticism. This may in turn perpetuate distress associated with the wrongdoing, rather than alleviate it.” In some instances, forgiveness may not be feasible or healthy, especially during or immediately after harm has been done. In other cases, emotions such as anger following a traumatic incident can sometimes serve as a catalyst for necessary action. “For instance, a teenager experiencing ongoing physical abuse might harness their anger to stand up and refuse (to take) further abuse. “Prematurely forgiving the abuser who shows no change in behaviour or remorse can potentially lead to further psychological harm. “In such cases, it is crucial to prioritise personal safety and emotional health over forgiveness,” Dr Lim said. If the person persists in the hurtful behaviour despite being forgiven, it is advisable to set clear boundaries to safeguard one’s well-being. In such cases, it may be necessary to even end the relationship, Dr Lim added. “Forgiveness in this context doesn’t require one to stay in a harmful situation, but to find peace with the past while making healthy choices about the future. “It’s the ability to love oneself despite these traumas, to put yourself first and live life to the fullest.” The popular saying of “to forgive and forget” is often too simplistic, and does not take into account the complexities involved in the emotional process of forgiveness, the experts cautioned. Dr John Lim, chief well-being officer at private service provider Singapore Counselling Centre, acknowledged that forgiving someone who has hurt you can be tough. “Trust may have been broken, and there might be a profound sense of injustice and betrayal,” he said. “The process involves not just excusing someone’s actions but finding a way to live with the impact of those actions — without letting them control one’s emotional well-being.” He also said that erasing memories of hurtful experiences is not always necessary for “true forgiveness” to take place. “It’s about releasing those memories from one’s grip so that one can go on living without holding grudges. “Recalling (past hurts or traumatic experiences) can be a process of learning that can aid the person in future boundary-setting and healthier decision-making,” he added. Conversely, suppressing those memories may interfere with the emotional processing that is required for healing. Dr BL Lim said: “Often, the healing process includes deliberate exposure to the memories within the safety of therapy.” Everyone has a unique recovery journey, so everyone’s path to healing is different, and forgiving someone is a personal choice that cannot be rushed or prescribed, Dr John Lim said. However, there are some practices that can aid in the healing process. Dr BL Lim said that therapy and counselling can provide a safe space for people to understand and process traumatic experiences. In therapy, techniques such as cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, also known as EMDR, are used. They can help people reframe negative thoughts, work through trauma and develop healthier emotional responses. “Forgiveness unfolds over time and requires acknowledging and working through complex emotions. “Individual therapy offers a supportive environment to delve into these emotions safely. “It facilitates a deeper understanding of one’s feelings and can open doors to forgiveness, helping people navigate their path towards healing more effectively,” Dr BL Lim said. In addition to therapy, cultivating self-compassion and mindfulness is crucial for those who have experienced trauma. Similar to mindfulness, embracing forgiveness is something that can be practised. The mental health experts suggested ways to develop a more forgiving attitude: Dr John Lim from the Singapore Counselling Centre said it is important to recognise that healing is possible regardless of whether there is forgiveness. “Healing is an extremely private process… For some, (forgiveness) is not a prerequisite for moving on and finding peace,” he added. “Focusing on self-compassion, seeking support from trustworthy people or professionals, and engaging in healing practices can be instrumental in moving from a place of pain to one of empowerment.” In Mrs Khoo's case, moving towards forgiveness has not been a simple task, but she recognised that she needed it for her own healing. She credited her religious faith as playing a significant role in her decision to forgive and not hold a grudge against her father. “Choosing forgiveness is a choice; it's not just a feeling because if we go by feelings, my human nature says that I don’t want to forgive,” she said. “There’s a saying that we often hear. ‘To err is human but to forgive, divine’. “Forgiveness is not a human process; it's actually something that you need to work with a higher power to be able to do it.” Despite her father’s apology after the birth of her first child, Mrs Khoo would not consider their relationship fully repaired. She recommended that he sought professional help, but he declined. To ensure the well-being and safety of her family, she has set boundaries and refrains from meeting him in person. To this day, though, she is “keeping the door opened” for the possibility that her father will eventually seek professional support, allowing for a full reconciliation. To people who are seeking forgiveness, Dr BL Lim emphasised that it should involve more than just an apology or seeking reconciliation. “It should be an act of restitution whereby the person (who hurt you) genuinely takes responsibility and makes efforts to rectify the wrong done. “In the instance where an adult has harmed a child, seeking forgiveness on the adult’s part involves taking full responsibility for the harm caused, offering a sincere apology and making amends through consistent, changed behaviour,” he said. - RoundBox@Children's Society (Toa Payoh): 6259 3735 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm) - Vox@Children's Society (Chai Chee): 6443 4139 (Mon to Fri, 9am to 6pm) - JYC@Children's Society (Jurong): 6566 6989 (Mon, Wed and Fri, 8.45am to 5.45pm) - The Fort@Children's Society (Radin Mas): 6276 5077 (Mon to Fri, 8.30am to 5.30pm) Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — She loved drinking bubble tea and whenever she felt stressed at work, she often snacked on “healthy” granola bars and fruit snacks. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — She loved drinking bubble tea and whenever she felt stressed at work, she often snacked on “healthy” granola bars and fruit snacks. Even though she told her dentist that she always chose reduced-sugar food items and that she was diligent about her oral hygiene routine, she was having several oral health problems at the age of 30. Dr James Ho, founder and chief executive officer of GPlus Dental Center and G Dental Center, said that despite the young officer worker was having cavities and gum inflammation, which made her swollen gums bleed easily whenever she brushed her teeth. The enamel surface of her teeth also showed signs of erosion, leading to tooth sensitivity. For many Singaporeans, snacking throughout the day is not just a casual indulgence; it is a way of life. However, the frequent consumption of sugar-laden treats and beverages has come at a cost to their oral health. Coupled with poor dental habits, it is no wonder that a significant proportion of adults here have to deal with oral health problems and retaining their natural teeth as they age. The latest National Adult Oral Health Survey in 2019 revealed that around a third (35 per cent) of Singaporeans aged 21 and above suffer from untreated dental caries. Additionally, a staggering 94 per cent of adults were found to have gum disease, which if left untreated, can progress to more severe conditions and even tooth loss. In 2020, the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) launched the Oral Health Movement 8020, a pilot programme that encourages people aged 40 and above to maintain at least 20 of their natural teeth beyond the age of 80. Its pilot study involving 780 adults aged 40 and above found that around 17 per cent were in the orally pre-frail or had tipped into the orally frail state. This means that a decline in oral function affects their ability to chew, swallow and speak. A key factor contributing to oral frailty is the number of remaining teeth. Dr Chan Pei Yuan, the programme lead for the Oral Health Movement 8020, noted that the programme has brought attention to the low awareness and prioritisation of oral health among Singaporeans. Dr Chan also pointed out that the National Adult Oral Health Survey found that more than a third (34.4 per cent) of the adults surveyed visited the dentist only when they experienced a problem with their teeth, mouth or dentures. Regular cleaning and preventive care are key to keeping your teeth and gums healthy. Dr Lee Wan Zhen, head of the periodontics unit with the department of restorative dentistry at NDCS, said: “Those who neglect regular dental check-ups and fail to address cavities in their early stages are at risk of losing their natural teeth permanently.” Dr Ho cautioned: “Delaying dental care can worsen cavities, requiring invasive treatments like root canals or extractions, while untreated gum disease may lead to costly procedures such as preventable gum surgery or tooth loss. “Similarly, ignoring a cracked tooth can result in infections, necessitating expensive treatments like dental crowns or root canals.” The dental experts listed below some common habits that are bad for your teeth and gums, along with what you can do to save your teeth and improve your oral health. Some people who are trying to lose weight believe that snacking or grazing on small meals throughout the day helps to boost metabolism rate. Not only is this not a proven claim, it is bad for your teeth because taking frequent small meals or snacks throughout the day does not give saliva enough time to neutralise acids in the mouth. However, being constantly on the move and juggling demanding work and personal schedules may mean that many younger adults tend to snack, rather than adhere to proper mealtimes, he said. “They also have a higher tendency to skip meals or have irregular meal patterns, since they eat when they feel is convenient to them. “Saliva production typically increases during meal times. Skipping meals or frequent snacking, especially when you snack outside of regular mealtimes, means there will be less saliva to help rinse away food particles and neutralise acids in the mouth, increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease,” he said. Dr Lee from NDCS explained that while eating or drinking, especially foods high in sugar or acids, the pH level in the mouth becomes more acidic, meaning the pH level becomes lower. When the pH levels fall below a certain critical level, the enamel that is the hard outer structure of teeth starts to dissolve. “Snacking throughout the day exposes teeth to a constant source of sugars that can be used by the oral bacteria to produce acids. “With frequent snacking, this acidic environment can persist for an extended period below the critical pH level (of 5.5), thereby providing ample time for acids to erode enamel and dentine (the middle layer of the tooth) and weaken teeth. “If snacking replaces meals or if snacks are low in water content, it can result in low salivary flow. Reduced saliva flow means less protection against acid attacks, increasing the risk of tooth decay,” Dr Lee added. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Have regular meals at fixed timings. This results in fewer acid attacks on the teeth, compared to continuous snacking, Dr Lee said. “Meals consumed at regular hours are followed by a period of time before the next meal, allowing time for saliva to neutralise acids and re-mineralise teeth between eating episodes,” she explained. Dr Ho said that continuous chewing — for at least 20 minutes — during regular mealtimes stimulates higher saliva flow. “Saliva contains essential minerals like calcium and phosphate, which help in the re-mineralisation process, repairing early signs of enamel erosion and decay.” Dr Lee advised having three balanced meals a day and if needed, to take oral health-friendly snacks in between (see point below). Popular sugary snacks and drinks that are sticky and chewy such as kueh, glutinous rice balls, mochi and bubble tea with its add-on gelatinous items in the form of jelly and tapioca balls tend to adhere to teeth, filling crevices and spaces for extended periods of time, promoting bacterial growth. Even dishes such as fried carrot cake with sweet dark soya sauce, mee siam and mee rebus has high sugar content. A diet high in sugar, acidic foods and beverages can contribute to tooth decay and erosion. This can weaken the enamel surface of teeth, making teeth more susceptible to cracking and also lead to tooth loss over time. The types of food and drinks considered acidic are citrus fruit such as oranges, vinegar-based salad dressings and health products such as apple cider vinegar. Dr Lee said that people who engage in an active lifestyle or play sports regularly might consume isotonic energy drinks, which can be high in sugars and acids. People may also drink sweetened caffeinated beverages such as instant coffee or caffeinated energy drinks to stay awake, most of which contain sugars, she added. Besides weakening tooth enamel, excessive sugar intake fuels bacteria in the mouth that can cause cavities. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Pick nutritious snacks that are low in sugar and acids, while high in nutrients such as fibre, calcium and vitamins. Some examples are: Dr Ho also said that although the choice of snacks may be important, it is not just acidic or sugary foods and beverages that may solely and directly affect oral health. “In the aftermath of snacking, take care of food particles that can become lodged between teeth, which promote bacterial growth and increase the risk of dental issues. “Post-snacking oral hygiene practices can help to reduce potential oral health problems. Do what is practically possible, like swishing water in your mouth after meals. “To minimise direct contact between sweet drinks and teeth, consider using a straw, which can reduce the risk of enamel erosion and tooth decay. “To minimise plastic, there are eco-friendly stainless steel straws and bamboo straws alternatives,” he added. The dentists also suggested consuming sugary or acidic food and drinks as part of a meal — for example, at the end of the meal — rather than as snacks throughout the day or a standalone snack. The increased saliva production during meals would help neutralise the acids. “Try to avoid snacking right before bedtime because saliva production decreases during sleep, leaving teeth more vulnerable to acids. “If you must snack at night, opt for a small low-sugar snack, drink water and brush your teeth afterward,” Dr Lee advised. Dr Ho pointed out that some research suggested that brushing teeth immediately after consuming something acidic can damage the enamel, so it may be advisable to wait around 30 minutes before brushing. However, removing food that stick between teeth should be done right after meals, either by flossing or even using a toothpick, he said. If you do not drink enough plain water throughout the day, it can lead to a dry mouth, increasing the risk of cavities due to reduced salivary flow, Dr Lee said. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Staying adequately hydrated — with plain water — is essential for maintaining saliva production and good oral health. Rinsing the mouth with water after consuming sweet beverages and food can also reduce teeth’s exposure to sugars and acids. “It helps to dilute and to wash away some of the sugar and acid residues, which can lessen the risk of tooth decay and enamel erosion,” Dr Ho advised. When munching on hard, crunchy food, it is advisable to exercise caution because that is a common cause of dental emergencies such as cracked teeth or lost fillings. “Hard, crunchy snacks can be detrimental to dental health as they can cause microscopic fractures in tooth enamel. In this hot weather, I also caution my patients against chewing on ice cubes,” Dr Ho said. Examples of hard food items that can cause such tiny fractures over time include nuts, potato chips or certain types of biscuits such as pretzel biscuits. That said, the extent of damage can vary, based on other factors such as dental health, enamel strength and some eating habits. For instance, teeth grinding, trauma from accidents or sports injury may weaken the tooth structure. Or habits such as cracking open chicken bone or crab shells using teeth can also cause stress fractures to accumulate on teeth, which may result in cracked or split teeth over time, Dr Lee said. For denture wearers, consuming hard, crunchy snacks can be problematic as well. “These snacks can exert excessive pressure on dentures, leading to discomfort, soreness or even damage to the dentures. “Also, hard food may cause dentures to become dislodged or loosen, increasing the risk of injury to the mouth or throat,” Dr Ho said. And on one other point, Dr Ho emphasised that “teeth are not tools”. Use the proper tools intended for opening packages and bottles or to crack hard nuts. “Once, a patient told me that whenever she could not rip a snack packaging apart, she would use her teeth instead. “I strongly advise not to use your teeth to open bottles, packages or perform other tasks because it can lead to chipping or other damage,” he said. WHAT YOU CAN DO : Dr Ho has the following tips for minimising the risk of cracked teeth while eating harder or crunchy food. Dr Chan, a consultant at the department of restorative dentistry in NDCS, said that for people with teeth grinding or clenching habits, managing stress or using a mouthguard can help prevent cracked teeth and preserve natural teeth. Then, there are parafunctional habits such as clenching of teeth, frequently chewing on hard foods, which can cause problems. Wearing a mouthguard when playing sports or doing high-impact activities such as skateboarding is also helpful. Regular dental check-ups are essential to detect and treat any emerging problems, which can prevent dental problems from progressing and leading to tooth loss later in life, Dr Chan added. Not brushing and flossing properly, or missing spots when cleaning allow plaque to build up on teeth and gums. Brushing and flossing are integral in preventing tooth decay because they remove the “food source” for the bacteria that causes tooth decay. If there is a thick biofilm of dental plaque, saliva cannot penetrate between teeth to help re-mineralise and reverse some of the acid damage on teeth, Dr Lee said. Urging young adults not to delay or neglect routine dental check-ups due to their busy schedules, Dr Ho said that this group of adults may have the perception that they are healthy and do not see the need to visit their dentist regularly. This is not true at all. Improving oral health requires a joint effort between home oral care and guidance provided by a dentist, he added. Besides detecting and treating issues early, a dentist can also give personalised instruction on how to brush and floss your teeth properly based on the person’s dental profile. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Dr Ho advised dedicating three to four minutes to oral care routine at least twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste. Incorporate flossing into your daily routine to clean between teeth and remove plaque from areas that your toothbrush may not reach. Selecting the right dental products matter, too. Use a toothpaste with fluoride to help neutralise harmful acid and strengthen the enamel. Dr Ho advised choosing a toothbrush with soft bristles and consider using an antiseptic or fluoride mouthwash as a form of supplementary oral care. Addressing the misconception that brushing harder or using a hard bristle brush removes more plaque, he said: “We sometimes hear dentists say, ‘Don't brush your teeth like you are scrubbing the kitchen floor’. “This is to emphasise to patients the need for gentle, circular motions rather than harsh scrubbing. “Using hard bristle brushes and brushing too vigorously can be harmful to oral health rather than beneficial.” Dr Ho also said that although some studies may suggest potential risks of long-term mouthwash use, such as cancer, the evidence is inconclusive. “Using mouthwash with fluoride regularly is beneficial after brushing and flossing. If you have just had oral surgery, and your dentist advises that you use mouthwash containing chlorohexidine, then you should do so. “Always consult your dentist and voice out any concerns that you may have. It is important to cultivate a trusting relationship with your dentist by having open communication,” he said. Schedule regular dental visits at least once a year, or as advised by your dentist. Dr Ho said that it is advisable to, where possible, try to stick with a regular dentist. “Dentist-hopping could perhaps lead to delay in detecting and treating dental issues and cause more permanent damage down the road.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — When Mr Bernard Sim shed a third of his 160kg frame within a year after bariatric surgery, he was thrilled and for the first time, experienced what it was like to be able to move “quickly” when he returns to his walk-up apartment. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When Mr Bernard Sim shed a third of his 160kg frame within a year after bariatric surgery, he was thrilled and for the first time, experienced what it was like to be able to move “quickly” when he returns to his walk-up apartment. Growing up as “that fat kid”, he had problems losing weight and developed low self-esteem . By age 15, he was morbidly obese, which meant that he had a body mass index of above 37.4. A normal body mass index is between 18.5 and 22.9. Mr Sim, now 34 and working as a programme manager at a bank, knew that it was only a matter of time before obesity led to medical problems . “You don't need a crystal ball to foresee that by my mid-30s, I would probably would have developed a chronic condition,” he said. He tried dieting and exercising, but losing a large amount of weight to attain a healthy weight felt impossible. “Most people struggle to lose even 1kg to 2kg. What more someone who needs to lose 20kg and more?” In late 2020, he consulted a doctor at a polyclinic and was referred to the Switch team at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH), where he underwent a sleeve gastrectomy. This is a type of weight loss surgery that removes a portion of the stomach to make it smaller. There are two common types of bariatric surgery and Mr Sim chose sleeve gastrectomy. Switch, which stands for Sengkang Weight Improvement Therapy and Complete Health, uses an evidence-based weight loss programme to help people lose and maintain weight in the long term. The surgery was a success, but as the kilos melted away, Mr Sim faced a new problem: Excessive skin folds that interfered with his self-confidence and quality of life. Describing the skin folds as “overhanging off the belly” and “drooping down towards the groin area”, Mr Sim said that they made him feel self-conscious. There was also the matter of hygiene and a risk of skin infection due to the skin rubbing, friction, moisture trapped in between the folds and rashes that can happen. “Going out on a hot day, I’ll be drenched in my own perspiration in 15 minutes or fewer. Naturally, there will be some odour. “And if it wasn’t pleasant for me, it wasn’t pleasant for anyone,” he said. Despite having lost 50kg to 60kg of body weight, he still mostly avoided activities that required him to remove his shirt, such as swimming. “I could (go swimming) perhaps, but it’d be unsightly for others.” After consulting the Switch team, Mr Sim decided to undergo another surgery in 2021 — this time, to remove the excess skin. Around 6kg of excess skin consisting of skin tissue was removed in a type of body contouring surgery known as a circumferential belt lipectomy. During the surgery, excess pannus — the area of skin and fat that hangs over the pubic region — was removed around the entire circumference of the body. Dr Kok Yee Onn, a consultant with the plastics, reconstructive and aesthetics service at SKH who performed the surgery on Mr Sim, said that the remaining skin was “pulled down to meet the groin along the underwear line”, so that the scar is concealed. Recognising that some people may think that these surgeries were the “quick and easy way out” to lose weight and excess skin, Mr Sim — who now weighs about 90kg — told of the determination required. “It took me a lot of resolve, pain and discomfort to get to this point,” he said of the two years from the time he underwent bariatric surgery, then body contouring surgery and recovery. “But it's worth it, and I encourage those who recognise that they cannot (lose weight) on their own to explore this avenue with their doctors. “You don't need to be held back by your frame, by how you look.” The Switch programme at SKH adopts a multidisciplinary-team approach to help patients lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. Bariatric surgery and post-bariatric body contouring surgery are among its clinical services. It is estimated that more than half of the patients who had bariatric surgery at SKH underwent body contouring surgery or were interested in body contouring surgery, though the hospital did not give the exact numbers when asked. In addition to younger patients, the team has seen more older patients in their 50s and 60s seeking to be “healthier and more active”, Dr Kok said. Bariatric surgery is surgery that achieves weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold . Patients typically spend two to three days in the hospital and are ready to return to work within three to four weeks, SKH states on its website. As with any surgery, there may be potential risks as well, such as bleeding, leaks and infection. As for body contouring surgery, one private doctor said that she performs one to three a month. Dr Lee Hanjing, visiting consultant and plastic surgeon at PanAsia Surgery, said that the ages of most patients ranged from their 20s to 50s. A common misconception about body contouring surgery is that it is a cosmetic procedure, but there are medical reasons involved. Dr Kok from SKH explained that body contouring surgery is “a medical procedure that is aimed at improving a person’s health and function”. Typically, it involves removing excess skin and fat from various parts of the body such as the abdomen, thigh and chest. It is done through a series of incisions or liposuction, followed by reshaping and tightening of the remaining tissues. Dr Kok said that doctors may recommend body contouring surgery after bariatric surgery, depending on individual circumstances. “Unlike cosmetic procedures like tummy tucks, where patients are well and desire enhancement of a normal body, body contouring offers more than just aesthetic benefits,” he added. He also said that the decision to undergo body contouring surgery is “highly personal” and should be discussed with a plastic surgeon. Another thing to note is that not everyone is suitable for body contouring surgery. Patients with significant medical issues (such as severe ischemic heart disease) or unstable weight may be considered unsuitable candidates, Dr Kok said. “Those with unstable weight are not suitable as they may end up gaining weight after body contouring surgery and waste the efforts of having gone through it.” Dr Lee from PanAsia Surgery explained that following massive weight loss, the soft tissues of the body (underlying skin and fat) deflate as weight is shed. Typically, the amount of weight loss after bariatric surgery tends to be greater than that achieved through natural weight loss. “The skin that had been previously stretched out would now appear as loose skin with folds, because the quality of the skin following massive weight loss or bariatric surgery has poorer elasticity,” she said. Dr Kok highlighted that excess skin after drastic weight loss can interfere with daily activities, cause discomfort and affect the person’s self-esteem. It is also an obstacle to keeping good hygiene since cleaning between skin folds can be hard. “For some people, it significantly affects their mental health and causes low mood and even depression. “In severe cases, the large skin folds may cause mobility issues, increase the risk of infections and cause wounds with repeated hospital admissions,\" he added. Dr Lee said that “it is not possible” to prevent excess skin after drastic weight loss, and the best way to manage it is to surgically remove it. “The excess skin is a result of the weight and stretch from when the patient was at his maximum weight. “When the soft tissues deflate following weight loss, the surface area of the excess skin is generally still the same as before,” she explained. Dr Kok pointed out that although toning exercises may improve muscle tone, they cannot effectively address excess skin after significant weight loss, which often requires surgical intervention. “The best-case scenario… is the body naturally adapting over time with some minor skin contraction, but not to the extent achieved by surgery,” he said. Dr Kok said that about four in five patients who have undergone bariatric surgery desire body contouring surgery. Besides improving confidence and psychological well-being, studies in American and Asian medical journals have shown that patients who had body contouring surgery after bariatric surgery experienced significant improvements in physical function and quality of life, Dr Lee added. For instance, a pilot study published in 2023 in the Biomolecules and Biomedicine medical journal found that body contouring surgery led to short-term improvements in insulin resistance. Those who had weight loss surgery also had better long-term blood sugar control and were less likely to experience severe blood sugar spikes compared to those who did not. Even after a person loses a lot of weight, fat may remain under the skin. Dr Kok said: “Body contouring can also improve the patient’s chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension by removing fat, which is a metabolic burden. “In some cases, patients have been cured of their diabetes and hypertension after undergoing bariatric surgery and body contouring surgery.” Dr Ben Ng, an endocrinologist at Arden Endocrinology Specialist Clinic, said it is important to be aware that body contouring procedures are “not a treatment for obesity , and not a weight-loss method”, although fatty tissue is removed from certain parts of the body during the procedure. Although there are several studies looking at the potential metabolic improvements using body contouring surgery, the evidence is “limited at present”, Dr Ng noted. “Currently, metabolic surgery such as the gastric sleeve that targets visceral obesity (fat around the internal organs) are showing the best clinical benefit. “Procedures such as body sculpturing may help, but definitive scientific data on the benefits of these procedures are still lacking.” Dr Ng explained that when a person gains weight, each fat cell increases in size. “During liposuction, for example, the fat cells in a specific area are permanently removed and this alters the shape of the body. “However, if the patient does not maintain a healthy lifestyle, the remaining fat cells will grow bigger,” he said. Body contouring procedures remove subcutaneous fat, which is the fat just under the skin, and not visceral fat. Visceral fat has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. That said, body contouring procedures can potentially help from a psychological perspective and motivate individuals to want to exercise more, Dr Ng said. “For health benefits and improvements to chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, it important to consider more evidence-based procedures such as metabolic surgery. “I would encourage all patients desiring weight loss to discuss in greater detail with their doctors,” he added. Dr Lee from PanAsia Surgery observed that patients generally feel more confident after body contour surgery, which improves their emotional and mental well-being as well as motivation to keep fit. After body contouring surgery, Mr Sim found that managing the drains and negative-pressure wound therapy machines attached to his body was the most challenging part of his recovery. After the surgery, surgical drain tubes, compression garments and supportive pressure support devices are usually used to enhance recovery, Dr Lee said. Mr Sim had about two negative-pressure machines and four surgical drain tubes attached to his body immediately after the surgery to remove excess fluid and promote healing. “I had to sleep with the surgical drains as well. There were occasions when I found myself just bound up right in the middle of the night and had to untangle myself. “Going out with a hospital bag and tubes sticking out my body also led to some uninvited attention,” he recalled. After the surgery, he was in the hospital for about six days. About three days after he was discharged, he was re-admitted to the hospital for a wound infection. The attachments finally came off about two months after surgery. Dr Kok said that the scars usually heal in two to four weeks, and patients can be back to doing physical activities a month or two after that. In the first few months after scars heal, however, exercises that cause excessive skin tension such as sit-ups must be avoided. Moderate activities such as jogging can start from the second month after scars heal; more intensive exercises usually from the third month. Dr Lee from PanAsia Surgery said that the cost depends on factors such as the areas being done on the body. Several areas can be combined in the same surgical setting. If multiple areas are bothering the patient, the surgery may be split into different operations. The amount of excess skin removed also varies. Body contouring surgery following bariatric surgery is subsidised at public hospitals because it leads to health improvements in chronic disease, confidence and function, Dr Kok from SKH said. It can also be claimed using the patient’s Central Provident Fund Medisave account. Mr Sim estimated that he paid around S$4,000 for the bariatric surgery and body contouring procedure after subsidies. He stayed in a Class C or six-bedder ward. The drastic weight loss and extensive body contouring surgery have been life-changing for Mr Sim. Recalling how he used to “stick out like a sore thumb” everywhere he went because of his weight, he said: “Living in Asia where most people have a smaller frame, it completely pulverised my self-confidence. “You go on a bus and you’re not able to share seats with people. “Your size is the first impression that people have of you, so right at the onset, everyone just knows you as ‘that fat kid’ — and that becomes your complete identity.” He would frequently get unwanted questions about his weight. “Out of nowhere, I would have people asking, ‘Have you thought of losing weight?’ or saying, ‘If you lose weight, you’ll be very handsome’. “It got to a point where I would expect these comments all the time. “I just carried on with life — not that it didn’t hurt,” he said. In social and professional settings, Mr Sim felt that he was often overlooked when he was at his heaviest. “I noticed that I wasn’t as ‘seen’ or ‘heard’ when I was at my heftiest — ironic. “I think there was a pre-judgement, that maybe bigger-sized guys don’t really know their stuff,” he added. “Whereas today, I notice that people and colleagues are more likely to want to get into conversations with me and understand my thoughts, whether it's seeking out my opinion or clarifications.” Besides having newfound confidence, Mr Sim also appreciates being fitter and more mobile. “I live in a walk-up apartment and now, I can get from the ground floor to my unit really quickly — that’s something I’ve never experienced before. “Previously, I will probably have to take breaks, struggle a lot. Getting onto airplane, sharing seats and sitting next to people, I don’t feel as self-conscious anymore. “Being able to be myself and not get pre-judged based on how I look is probably the icing on the cake.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features A nutritionist, dietician and dermatologist explained how collagen really works, what to look out for as buyers, and gave tips on what else you can do to improve your skincare. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Behold the marketing claims that say collagen broth or the “beauty hot pot” will give a youthful glow to your face and prevent wrinkles or the loss of elasticity to your skin. No matter how enticing it is, as a consumer, you need to know the science behind how it works, so that you understand what happens as you watch that translucent jelly-like collagen melt in the pot or swirl in your bubble tea. Collagen-infused food items continue to flood the market here — from personalities putting their names behind collagen soup mixes to hawkers selling collagen porridge or food prepared in collagen gravy, and stores stocking collagen broth in frozen packs and even collagen \"hot pot\" instant noodles. A nutritionist, dietician and an aesthetic doctor explained how collagen really works, what to look out for as buyers, and gave tips on what else you can do to improve your skincare. Collagen is a type of protein that the human body produces naturally using amino acids from protein-rich or collagen-rich food such as bone broth, fish and meat. It makes up 65 per cent of the total protein found in the body. As the largest protein, collagen is a chain of more than 1,500 amino acids. It is found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, cartilage and bones. Collagen works with other substances to maintain skin elasticity, volume and moisture. It also helps make up proteins such as keratin that form skin, hair and nails. Dr Edwin Lim, medical director of Edwin Lim Medical Aesthetic Clinic, said: “Additionally, collagen supports the function of fibroblasts, which promote continuous regeneration and repair of the skin.” However, the rate at which the body produces collagen naturally starts decreasing when individuals reach their mid-20s and this accelerates over time. Aside from the ageing factor, sun damage, smoking and alcohol and sugar consumption all decrease collagen production, leading to thinner and weaker skin. Ms Jaclyn Reutens, clinical and sports dietitian with Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants, said that genetics, too, can influence the collagen synthesis rate, just as how they influence the amount of melanin (hair, eye and skin pigmentation) every person has. Genetics also determine how much elastin and keratin the body produces. The answer to this is: No, the collagen found in food and drinks will not help to increase collagen production. The science is simply this: The human body cannot absorb collagen in its whole form to replenish the collagen lost. The molecules are too big to directly enter the bloodstream or the skin. When it enters the stomach, collagen gets broken down into peptides during digestion, which are short chains of amino acids. Once it is broken down, there is no control over and no knowing how much of it is absorbed. The body will deposit it where it is most needed, which may not be the skin but in muscles, bones, tendons or cartilages. Singapore-accredited nutritionist Adlyn Farizah said that the amino acids can also be found in many other protein-rich foods, not only from collagen-infused foods. In other words, your everyday food such as meat, poultry and seafood have just as much to offer in terms of protein intake to help your body make collagen. And you are paying for soup or bubble tea that may be adding more sodium or sugar into your body. As for collagen supplements, there are still no large-scale studies to prove they work. Doctors Payal Patel and Maryanne Makredes Senna wrote in an article on Harvard Health Publishing’s website under the Harvard Medical School that no human studies have clearly proven that collagen taken orally will end up in the skin and hair. What exists are some trials regarding the use of such supplements. Most of the studies on the benefits of collagen supplements and skin health are small-scale trials done by companies that manufacture the collagen products themselves, Ms Adlyn the nutritionist said. Ms Reutens the dietitian said that these supplements typically contain a hydrolysed form of collagen, which means that it has been broken down into smaller peptides to ensure more of it gets absorbed into the body. There are keywords that consumers can look out for in the packaging's ingredients list to discern whether a collagen supplement is more likely to work as advertised, Ms Reutens added. They include collagen peptides, marine collagen, and hydrolysed collagen on the packaging, rather than simply “collagen”. Terms such as hydrolysed marine collagen peptides, in particular, are considered a superior form of collagen compared to bovine-sourced collagen or collagen derived from cows. However, people allergic to fish and shellfish should not consume marine collagen. Look out also for prolyl-hydroxyproline and hydroxyprolyl-glycine — two peptides that have undergone more research and been proven to improve elasticity, texture and wrinkles. These supplements also usually contain ingredients such as vitamins A and C, zinc, antioxidants, and hyaluronic acid that are equally beneficial to skin. That said, individuals who suffer from kidney and liver problems should be mindful of their protein intake. Ms Reutens also recommended steering clear of products with fillers such as iron oxide, mineral oil, and carrageenan. Ultimately, more research is still needed to determine collagen’s actual impact in these results. Another aspect that requires further research is the safety of consumption and the potential long-term effects. One of the reasons for this is that the quality and sources of collagen supplements can vary significantly. Dr Lim from the aesthetic clinic warned: “Some supplements may contain additives or contaminants that could pose health risks.” Unlike medicine, supplements do not require approval and are not evaluated by the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore before they can be sold here. This may mean that the purity and content of such products vary. Similarly, there are no guidelines from the Singapore Food Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration for a food or drink product to be defined as containing collagen, Ms Reutens said. Furthermore, there are no established upper safety limits of collagen, though some studies have suggested that the recommended amount to take for effectiveness is between 2.5g and 15g daily. Consumers are therefore strongly encouraged to exercise due diligence when buying or taking collagen supplements. So without oral ingestion of collagen, you are better off sticking to the tried-and-tested methods of caring for your skin. When choosing skincare products that help to stimulate collagen production, Dr Lim suggested picking those that contain ingredients such as retinol and vitamin C, which are more likely to yield visible results. Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A, and promotes cell turnover as well as collagen synthesis. With consistent use, it can reduce wrinkles and improve skin texture. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that works to protect the skin against environmental damage and support collagen formation. Like any other skincare product, it is worth noting that their effectiveness can be influenced by factors such as one’s skin type, the product’s formula, and the concentration of active ingredients. Dr Lim also said that there are a number of treatments that can directly stimulate collagen production in the dermis (middle layer of the skin). One of them is high-intensity focused ultrasound, which uses ultrasound energy to heat the layers of the skin. Others include the CO2 fractional laser and microneedling, both of which create controlled micro-injuries in the skin to trigger the body’s natural healing response, leading to a boost in collagen production. CO2 fractional laser is also taken up by people looking to heal acne scars. Due to the direct nature of these treatments, they can provide more visible results compared to supplements and topical products, Dr Lim said. The results tend to last longer because they are able to target the deeper skin layers. Although a decrease in natural collagen production rate is a natural part of ageing, there are still plenty of natural food items and lifestyle habits that can help to maintain skin health. In terms of lifestyle habits: To go one step further in supporting skin health, consider other types of supplements beyond collagen-based ones, Ms Reutens suggested. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce skin damage and lower one’s risk of skin cancer, she added. Biotin, a B vitamin, is beneficial for not only skin health, but hair and nails as well. You may also take a vitamin C supplement if you are not getting enough amounts from your diet. Now that you are educated about collagen, the next thing to do is to inform those who are not as discerning. As an informed consumer, you should have the mind to keep to common-sense health habits that will also help you make some savings: Pay less for the rich collagen hot pot, stop smoking cigarettes, reduce alcohol intake, and have a well-balanced diet. For a well-balanced meal, Ms Adlyn the nutritionist recommended following the Health Promotion Board’s My Healthy Plate guide. This would mean filling one’s plate with: If you must consume alcohol, keep to two drinks or fewer daily for men or one drink or fewer daily for women. If you have any pressing concerns about your skin or hair conditions, talk to your doctor or a dermatologist for advice.

The author is an IT director with a government agency, and a part-time student pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at NUS. The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life. In this instalment, Mr Toh Hong Giep, 51, recounts his learning journey over the years to become a more “T-shaped” person, with broad knowledge across different disciplines and deep expertise in a few specific areas. Mr Toh, an IT professional, is now pursuing his second master’s degree in business analytics. Despite having a different approach to learning than his younger coursemates, it is important to embrace new technologies to stay relevant, he says. In today's rapidly changing world, continuous learning is not just a nice-to-have — it is a necessity. As an IT professional with more than 20 years of experience working in multiple countries, I understand the importance of keeping up with the latest technologies and business practices. I am currently an IT director with a government agency. My responsibilities include overseeing projects to ensure that they receive timely support and actively engaging stakeholders to stay in tune with their business needs. Equally important, I will roll up my sleeves and work alongside my team to fix technical issues. One concept that has been particularly useful in my career is the idea of being a “T-shaped” person through lifelong learning. This means having broad knowledge and skills across different disciplines (the top of the T) and deep expertise in one or a few specific areas (the vertical line of the T). For example, to enhance my understanding of the business world beyond the technology lens, I pursued the Tsinghua-Insead Executive MBA programme (EMBA) in 2007. This was 10 years after I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems & Information Science from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 1997. The EMBA was an 18-month programme, anchored in Singapore and Beijing, with lessons in Fontainebleau, France and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It provided me with a broader perspective on business, ranging from strategy and marketing to finance and operations. I also got to interact with professionals from different industries, which gave me a fresh perspective on various business challenges. The course opened my eyes to the myriad and complex decisions often faced by senior management. This allowed me to better approach issues from their perspective and build closer partnerships. My passion for learning did not stop after my EMBA. In 2021, at the age of 49, I enrolled in the NUS Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) programme and will graduate this year. I’ve always enjoyed studying computer science and this programme was a great opportunity to get a deep technical understanding of the various techniques and tools used in data analytics. It covers topics like fraud analysis, propensity analysis and recommendation engines which businesses use to predict what customers will like. Lifelong learning is not without its challenges. As a working professional, finding time to learn can be hard. It is difficult to balance work, family, and personal commitments. Luckily, my wife and two teenage children are very supportive. To strike a balance between family and study, I usually set aside weekend afternoons or evenings for family activities while leaving the rest for my coursework. Even with family support, staying motivated and focused can be daunting. To overcome this, I break my coursework down into manageable tasks and proactively seek support from faculty members and fellow classmates. Interacting with classmates from the younger generation, especially millennials, I see that they have a different approach to learning. They are more digitally savvy and prefer interactive and engaging methods such as gamification and micro-learning. While this may not appeal to everyone, it is important to embrace new technologies and learning models to stay relevant in the digital age. For example, I learned to go back to lecture recordings or use online resources to clarify any unclear points. This works well for me as I can schedule my learning to fit pockets of free time. Being a T-shaped person has made me more versatile, adaptable, and valuable to employers. It has allowed me to collaborate across different fields and apply knowledge from various areas to solve problems. Despite the challenges, lifelong learning has been fulfilling and rewarding, and has allowed me to grow personally and professionally. As the car magnate Henry Ford once said, \"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at 20 or 80. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.\" ABOUT THE WRITER: Mr Toh Hong Giep, 51, is an IT director with a government agency.

The author is a corporate safety manager for a local construction company. The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life. In this instalment, Mr Mohammed Faiz Junaidi, 38, recounts his academic journey from the Institute of Technical Education to completing his master's degree as an adult. Despite his early struggles, he discovered his passion for his career as a safety professional and upgraded his skills over the years to retain his competitive edge. I completed my Master of Science in Health and Safety at the Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS) in March. This was just a year after getting my Bachelor of Science in Safety, Health and Environmental Management , also at MDIS, at the age of 37. Looking back at my 16 years as a safety professional, I would not have imagined achieving this when I was younger. As a child, I had a mischievous nature and found it difficult to sit still. Staying focused was a challenge, as images of toys and cartoons continuously flashed through my head. As I got older, my mind would often wander to football. During that period, conversations on mental conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder were scarce, and I did not seek medical attention or get a diagnosis. Luckily, my academic performance was unaffected. I finished primary school in 1997 and subsequently passed my GCE N-Levels. With my parents’ encouragement, I completed a Nitec in Automotive Technology (Light Vehicles) at the Institute of Technical Education Ang Mo Kio. In 2007, I began working as a technician at ComfortDelGro’s taxi service centre after my National Service. However, my time in the automotive industry was short-lived. A few months later, I was offered a position as a trainee safety advisor in the oil and gas industry. This marked the beginning of my career in Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE). I was motivated to advance in this career as I saw how safety lapses led to injuries, and how machinery became faulty in the hands of untrained workers. I also enjoyed communicating with workers and their management on how to prevent injuries and unnecessary breakdowns. I obtained a specialist diploma in workplace safety and health at the BCA Academy in 2011. This allowed me to become a registered safety officer recognised by the Ministry of Manpower. During that period, balancing my work with part-time studies was still manageable because I was still single. I was then a safety coordinator in the oil and gas sector and planned my night classes around my shifts. In the following years, I observed changes in the industry, such as more foreigners getting registered as safety officers. Most job postings also required safety officers to have degrees. Thus, in 2019, I enrolled in my degree programme at MDIS. I chose MDIS for its attractive fees and because its degree is IOSH-accredited. IOSH, or the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, is a global organisation for health and safety professionals. I felt that such accreditation would give me an edge over similar degrees from other institutions. Compared to my previous studies in 2011, I had to care for my two children, then aged one and four, and support my wife. I was then a HSE advisor for an integrated facility management company working normal office hours. When I returned to school, I was excited and nervous. The lecturers were very accommodating to our work commitments. They shared their contact details with us so we could reach them if we had questions. A big challenge that I faced when attending school was that I had less time to play with my children. When I got home after class, they would be sleeping, and would still be asleep the next morning when I left for work. Nevertheless, with my family’s unwavering support, I excelled in my bachelor's programme and graduated with first-class honours. I was eager to continue my professional growth and started my master’s course exactly a year later. It was an easy decision to carry on at MDIS, thanks to the lecturers who assisted us. Furthering my studies was a dream which I thought was unachievable since I was from the ITE stream. Through my academic journey, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the HSE field, including best practices in risk management, occupational safety, and environmental sustainability. I have also honed my analytical skills, enabling my ability to identify potential hazards and develop effective strategies to mitigate them. As I reflect on my journey thus far, I am grateful for the opportunities that have shaped me into what I am today.

I wonder whether anyone would seriously argue that requiring helmets or safety harnesses for construction workers would be undesirable because of “real, practical and operational complexities”. Of course there are complexities and costs, but we as a society tackle these complexities and incur these costs because human safety is at stake . Respect for safety and human life is part of our social compact. Therefore, the alleged “complexities” of arranging bus transport for workers, instead of having them ride in lorries, would not involve a “change in the social compact”, as various businesses have claimed . Far from it — it would advance the values that Singaporeans hold dear. One might argue that costs may increase (although I have seen no attempt to quantify these costs concretely). But other safety measures — protective equipment, safety protocols, and limits on working hours also cost money. The question, then, is whether taking more steps to secure the safety of workers, to the equal extent that we secure the safety of other road users, is worth the money. I say it is. And if the costs of prohibiting lorry transport are intangible, I ask: What about the intangible costs of allowing it? Would workers who are made to ride in lorries lose morale, resulting in a diminished question of work? Perhaps this argument is speculative. But it is no less speculative than the claims by the business groups that banning lorry transport will cause traffic jams . There is also an issue of consistency in policy. If riding in the back of a lorry is safe, why should workers be the only ones carried in lorries? If lorries are deemed safe enough, why not allow large families or groups of friends to get around in lorries instead of multiple cars? Why not allow minibus operators to provide lorry transport for the public, or have a lorry service to carry groups of tourists on tours? Why not replace school buses with lorries (which can probably hold more children)? These, too, may well be cheaper for everyone. But if lorry transport is deemed not safe enough for the public generally — even if it is cheaper — then why should we consider it safe enough for some workers?

    "article_content": "Voices My innate love for animals from young and the desire to help them had led me to turning it into a veterinary career. Today, however, I speak the language of programming in the technology industry. The writer is undergoing a cybersecurity specialist training programme with Red Alpha Cybersecurity, after previously working for two years as a veterinary technician. My innate love for animals from young and the desire to help them had led me to turning it into a veterinary career. Today, however, I speak the language of programming in the technology industry. The change, drastic as it may sounds, wasn’t made out of necessity. Rather, it stemmed from a self-reflecting period where I chose to push myself beyond passion to explore other career options. I graduated with a Diploma in Veterinary Bioscience from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2016 and worked as a veterinary technician at an animal clinic for two years from 2019 to 2020 after completing my national service. Many things were uncertain at that time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. People were losing their jobs and workers being forced to change career paths. Through these, I saw the importance of continuous learning to obtain new knowledge and skills throughout our careers, especially in times of crisis. The pandemic might have had many businesses on the ropes, but it also inspired innovation and was a game-changer for the start-up ecosystem. I was motivated by the sector’s vibrancy and wanted to be a part of it. While it was difficult to give up what I had studied to pursue new pastures, I found that I could still fuel my passion for animals through volunteer work at animal shelters. I joined an online automotive marketplace in January 2021 to experience life in a start-up environment where people wear multiple hats. I picked up different skillsets and worked in cross-functional teams which exposed me to tech development. In July 2022, I enrolled in a part-time Bachelor in Information and Communications Technology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences to boost my knowledge of new technologies that connect the physical and digital worlds. At the same time, I was looking out for jobs that could complement my studies. That took me to Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme for Tech Professionals, specifically Red Alpha Cybersecurity's specialist training programme which provides classroom and on-the-job training for those who did not have relevant experience in cybersecurity, a lynchpin of the digital world. I left my previous workplace in March this year and joined Red Alpha in April as an Associate Cybersecurity Specialist to pick up new skills in areas such as penetration testing and network forensics. I am currently in the training phases of the programme and attending courses on hacker tools, techniques, incident handling as well as penetration testing, which is a simulated cyber attack to check for exploitable vulnerabilities, so that I can obtain relevant certifications and the requisite skillsets to be a practitioner in the industry. At the same time, I am able to tap a strong network of cybersecurity practitioners made up of instructors, industry mentors and Red Alpha alumni, and that has helped to accelerate my learning and made the transition more manageable. Working in a start-up previously required creative problem solving and active communications, and I found that these soft skills were also applicable in the cybersecurity field. Switching from a career path fueled by the passion I had since young to one that was shaped by a more pragmatic approach wasn’t easy. It was a heavy decision to make as I had to commit both money and time to it. The learning curve has been steep especially since I have to learn an entirely new set of skills, but I know that I have to work extra hard to be successful. Technologies are ever-changing, and thus those who excel are people who can adapt and learn as they progress in their careers.

    "article_content": "Voices My career in the eldercare sector began in February 2018, when I volunteered with the Silver Generation Office (SGO), the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care. The author is a centre supervisor at All Saints Home. The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life. In this instalment, Ms Chang Xue Qi, 28, describes the challenges of being the youngest supervisor at a senior daycare centre — especially when dealing with staff. On top of picking up people management skills on the job, Ms Chang is also pursuing a master’s degree in applied gerontology to better serve her elderly clients. My career in the eldercare sector began in February 2018, when I volunteered with the Silver Generation Office (SGO), the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care. My grandmother sparked my interest in caring for the elderly. She was an instrumental figure in my growing-up years, having left her job as a factory worker to look after me when I was born. Through her, I learnt values such as empathy and compassion. I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2018, with an honours degree in political science. Inspired by my grandmother, my honours thesis was about improving the effectiveness of policy communications to the elderly. I joined SGO full-time in July 2018. There, I actively reached out to seniors and their caregivers to assist them with various government schemes and policies. That sparked my interest to learn more about ageing issues, so I took up a part-time specialist diploma in gerontology at Temasek Polytechnic in October 2020. It was difficult juggling work and study commitments. Blessed with supportive family members, lecturers, classmates and colleagues, I managed to graduate in May 2022 and was the valedictorian for my cohort. It is one of the proudest moments in my working life. Before graduating, I was offered the opportunity to manage the All Saints Home in Yishun, which is a nursing home that also provides day care and other services for seniors, but I was unsure if I could be a good supervisor. However, my current boss encouraged me to try interviewing for the job. To my delight, I was accepted and started work in March 2022. I was, and still am, the youngest supervisor in my organisation. Managing a daycare centre is an uphill task. I could communicate well with seniors, but it is a different ball game with staff. I had to learn people management and communication skills on the job. For example, when I receive complaints about staff behaviour, I need to tactfully speak to those concerned about it. Many of them are senior staff who are much older than me. I often spend time thinking about the right words and body language to convey my message, so that I can strike a balance between correcting misbehaviour and keeping staff motivated. All this happened as I was starting my part-time master’s degree in applied gerontology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in August 2022. I felt that this programme was a natural progression from my diploma, as it could equip me with skills and knowledge to better serve the elderly. If all goes well, I should graduate in July 2024. My family is my pillar of support; they unconditionally allowed me to pursue my aspirations and even offered to fund my studies. They did not have to do so, as I later secured a full tuition scholarship from Ngee Ann Kongsi, which I’m deeply grateful for. Juggling my new job and the master’s is definitely challenging. I have to sacrifice my weekends to study. On weekday nights after work, I rush to NTU for my classes — a nerve-racking journey due to traffic. Nevertheless, I enjoy my classes. My favourite module so far is leadership and management in aged care, where I learnt about strategic management and various personality types. I now understand why people behave in certain ways, and how I can fine-tune my communications with them. It is both rewarding and challenging managing a team of 14 staff, with vastly different ages and backgrounds. Working in an elderly-dominated environment has also trained me to be mature and tactful in handling difficult situations. Being a supervisor, I’ve learnt to be less task-oriented, and instead focus on engaging staff and caring about their well-being. This was a paradigm shift from my previous SGO job, but surely and slowly, I am learning to empathise with my staff more. My boss once said he wanted to pay it forward by mentoring me, because he benefited from his own experience. I aspire to do the same too. My advice to people embarking on a similar journey? There is no fixed age to being a leader or supervisor. With the right mentorship and a positive learning attitude, you can make it. ABOUT THE WRITER: Ms Chang Xue Qi, 28, is a centre supervisor at All Saints Home. She is pursuing her master’s degree in applied gerontology at Nanyang Technological University.

    "article_content": "Voices The issue of car ownership amid skyrocketing Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums was hotly debated by TODAY readers this week, after a recent Big Read shone the spotlight on why people still buy cars in Singapore. Here's a selection of comments. The issue of car ownership amid skyrocketing Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums was hotly debated by TODAY readers this week. In TODAY’s Big Read series last weekend, car dealers, owners and industry observers shared their views on why people still buy cars in Singapore, and how the market has responded to help consumers. Readers were divided over the issue, with many saying that families with young children or the elderly should be entitled to own a car. Others disagreed, saying that Singapore’s public transport system was sufficient, while some suggested changes to the COE system to bring down prices. Here's a selection of comments: COEs should be allocated based on need, not affordability. Families with children or (the) elderly should be entitled to own one family sedan (not a luxurious continental car) without the need to pay for COE. A basic car for a family should be treated like a HDB flat. The current formula based solely on affordability is twisted — those who are well-off can own multiple cars… even though such individuals don't need it; or those using the car for business, such as private hires. HO YEW CHIN If you're out without your kids and it starts raining, you'll find it hard to get a cab or PHV (private hire vehicle). Now if you have one kid with you, your pool of options lessens because you either have to call a standard cab or the PHV family version. If you have more than one kid with you, getting a family PHV with multiple child seats is challenging and your pool of options drastically reduces. Of course, you can always take public transport, which comes with its own set of challenges depending how old your kids are. JAN TAN Sometimes, we families with small kids would love to travel via public transport, but our fellow commuters are something else. Lifts meant for the elderly and prams are all filled up with abled(-bodied) people who don’t bat an eyelid to those in need. On buses, people stand at the area where prams are supposed to be parked… Our transport system is excellent. It’s the users who are lacking EQ and IQ. NOURA YUSOFF I’ve got a 76-year-old mum and 93-year-old grandma. Every Sunday I take them out for dinner which (makes them) very happy. I occasionally take them to the supermarket to buy groceries. That’s how important owning a car is. The Government should make it affordable for all families to own their first car. Those who buy a second car should be made to pay higher. GOH KHENG LENG I die die won't buy a car because our transport system is good. Point to point, no need to fight or wait for parking, kena (get) summon, (pay) road tax, insurance… and season parking. Taxi, Grab and others, reach destination, open door (and) walk, which is so convenient. ROY TANG My parents and their parents, together with my uncles and aunties’ generations, did not have a car when they were bringing up their families. It can be done, in fact brings you much closer to your children than being a driver. CALVIN YO Times have changed. Do not live the way our fathers have lived on this land. This is now a modern city, live like a city dweller. If you insist on owning a car in a city, it is an extravagance you must be prepared to pay for. Weekend rental or car-pooling is another alternative over public transport. TAN FAITH In Singapore, driving or riding is actually not considered a \"leisure ride\" since our country is small. So many traffic lights too… even if you pay for ERP (Electronic Road Pricing), you can still be stuck in a traffic jam. YUJIN TAN Ultimately, we must recognise that a car is still a luxury rather than a necessity (even for those who really need it), regardless of which angle you look at it, and that affordability is not something we can solve for. CHENG FEI The answer lies in the satellite-based ERP system, which is long overdue… When the new ERP system can control the usage of roads at an optimum level… it could result in the Government being able to release more COEs for each monthly bidding. Car ownership does not cause traffic congestion. It is the use of cars on the roads at the same time that causes traffic jams. TAN KOK TIM Separate the COE for families and (those) that need a car to make a living. Those who own more than one family car (should be) considered a luxury COE. PETER LEE A Catch-22 situation. A better public transport system needs higher ridership to be cost effective. Higher ridership means more crowding, more inconvenience, especially during peak hours… More taxis, more PHVs, higher COEs, higher fares, more traffic, more congestion, more unproductive. Higher COEs also push up other transport costs. There must be a balance. The system needs an overhaul. If our infrastructure cannot support the bulging population growth, slow it down.

    "article_content": "Voices I have been a housekeeper at various hotels in Malaysia and Singapore for 14 years and counting. Ms Sophia Lee at her workplace at Village Hotel Bugis on Nov 10, 2023. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young people who have chosen careers in manual trades — and are thriving. Here, Ms Sophia Lee, 35, who has been a hotel housekeeper for nine years, shares about her love for creating memorable experiences for guests, despite her friends sometimes making fun of her job. I have been a housekeeper at various hotels in Malaysia and Singapore for 14 years and counting. My first housekeeping stint was at a hotel in Ipoh, Malaysia, in 2010. I was earning my diploma in Hospitality Management at Keris College and had to complete an internship with a hotel before graduation. It was my introduction to the world of housekeeping, at a time without much technology. Back then, room attendants had to carry and consult extensive paperwork when cleaning, particularly for VIP rooms. Updating the room cleaning report was a manual task, as was the meticulous counting of soiled linen — a far cry from the electronic systems used today. That internship laid a strong foundation in housekeeping for me, and I fell in love with the job because it allowed me to be on my feet and be actively engaged. Plus, I also had a passion for crafting exceptional experiences for guests. Since then, I continued to hone my skills at various hotels, including my current role at Village Hotel Bugis, where I have been based since 2017. A typical workday starts with a team line-up during which we will need to meticulously discuss room assignments, special guest requests, and any specific details requiring our attention. Our primary focus is to ensure that our guests feel welcomed and have a great stay. My responsibilities include overseeing cleaning schedules, conducting quality assessments, and managing inventory to ensure things operate seamlessly. Like many service industry roles, housekeeping has its unique set of challenges. A significant one is adapting to guests’ ever-changing demands. I recall an instance where a guest reported an issue with their room's air-conditioning moments after checking in. Upon inspection, it turned out that the system required some time to reach the desired temperature, which is normal. Unfortunately, the guest was impatient. Recognising the situation, I immediately asked my colleagues to expedite the cooling process in another room and contacted the duty manager to switch the guest to the room that was already cooled. Within a few minutes, the issue was resolved, and the guest appreciated our prompt response. What I find most rewarding about my work is the immediate satisfaction derived from the positive feedback from our guests on their stay. Though we are the “ninjas” behind the scenes, we know that housekeeping plays an important role. My team and I are always looking to enhance the guest experience with us. Once in 2018, I had the idea to create a kid-themed room. We got excited and we spent time getting creative. It involved hours of wall painting, decorations, and carefully choosing suitable furniture for the theme. A week later, we unveiled our room. The reaction from our guests exceeded our expectations, and demand for these rooms skyrocketed. Families were booking them months in advance, and compliments poured in. It will always be a reminder to me how innovation can enhance our guests’ experience, which makes the job exciting for me! For aspiring housekeepers, I recommend that you start by taking a role to build your foundation. There are many skills that are essential for housekeeping, such as attention to detail, effective time management, and good communication. Specific training is also vital so that we can uphold high standards of cleanliness, safety, and guest satisfaction. I have gone through such training myself, for example Workforce Skills Qualifications in areas such as cleaning and sanitation, and workplace safety and health. Despite this, hotel housekeeping is a profession that may not always receive the recognition it deserves. It is not uncommon for family and friends to misunderstand the challenges and dedication that this line of work demands. My friends sometimes make playful remarks about me \"helping guests wash toilet bowls”. However, I take immense pride in what I do and am always quick to respond that I can even draw a proper toilet bowl, as I've seen quite a few in my career. The essence of our work goes far beyond cleaning. It revolves around creating memorable and joyous experiences for our guests, and requires dedication, adaptability, and a profound passion for hospitality.

My father, a professional mechanic, would perform “magic” whenever he fired up a car engine that could not start. It fascinated me to no end. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young people who have chosen careers in manual trades — and are thriving. Here, Mr Charles Lee, 34, recounts his journey to becoming an automotive engineer at his family's car workshop. Recognising a need for relevant skills beyond his mechanical engineering degree, Mr Lee earned a certificate at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and gained work experience before convincing his father that he could add value to the business. My interest in the automotive industry started when I was eight. My father, a professional mechanic, would perform “magic” whenever he fired up a car engine that could not start. It fascinated me to no end. By the time I turned 16, I was already helping out at his workshop during the December school holidays. I learnt to change engine oil and replace tyres. As I grew older, I was taught basic diagnosis skills. Fast forward to 2015. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. I got a job as a procurement engineer dealing with made-to-order parts and later, worked at a company that fabricated aerobridges. I have always maintained an interest in joining the automotive industry. When I saw my family members struggling with the physical demands of the job as they got older, I decided to take the plunge. In 2016, I started taking a part-time Nitec in Automotive Technology at Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West. My father was initially not keen on the move, asking me why I was studying at ITE when he had sent me to university. However, I went ahead because I wanted to get the technical knowledge required to help him and the family business. I graduated with a Certificate of Merit one-and-a-half years later. Recognising a gap in my knowledge about high voltage vehicles, I also enrolled in an Institute of Motor Industry course in Penang in 2018. There, I learnt how to safely handle high voltage automotive systems. That same year, I joined Hyundai distributor Komoco Motors and stayed there for three years as an automotive engineer. I had the opportunity to travel to Korea to see technologies and receive training for vehicles that are not found in Singapore. Being an engineer can be quite taxing physically. During my training at Komoco, I was required to help take down and do a solo repair on a double clutch gearbox. At about 90kg, it was probably the heaviest load that I have ever carried. However, an experienced mechanic told me how and where to use my body strength to do the repair without hurting myself. That came in handy in learning how to handle heavy loads. I did a short stint with a Chinese battery company, before joining my family’s business in 2022. Over time, my father accepted that my knowledge can improve customer experience, reduce costs to customers and improve our technology use. For example, I helped to digitise all our invoices and expenses. This allowed us to quickly find our customers’ records. We now know what was last done to their car, how much was charged, and how frequently a customer visits us. In turn, that gives us the freedom to offer appropriate discounts. My family agrees too that it is time that I take on the responsibility to keep the business going. Fortunately, I find this trade very interesting. My job involves helping out with repairs while managing diagnostics and marketing. A typical day starts when a vehicle comes in with an issue. I will diagnose the issue to determine the type of repairs required and get the required parts. A common challenge I face is deciding on the right repairs for a vehicle while ensuring the customer’s budget is met. Sometimes, work and parts that look easy may be deceptively difficult. However, I get satisfaction from learning the quirks of different vehicles and helping someone’s day turn from bad to good. I also take pride in helping workers upskill. One of my proudest moments was when I successfully guided a worker through a complicated gearbox repair which he had never done before. I feel my own unique background and experience will help the family business smoothly pivot to electric vehicles. Hopefully, with external investment, we can eventually be a dealer for green vehicles. If I ever have kids who want to follow in my footsteps, my advice to them would be to get industry experience to build up their reputation and credibility, embrace new technologies and always do the right thing for the customers that put their faith in you.

Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young people who have chosen careers in manual trades — and are thriving. Here, Mr Eric Ng, 41, shares his unconventional journey to becoming a professional airbrush artist. Despite lacking a formal art education — and the painstaking work involved — Mr Ng’s passion for his craft has led to projects for Malaysian royalty and other celebrities. My innate love for art since young is the reason why I am an airbrush artist today. As a child, my eyes would light up at the sight of colours, and I spent hours with crayons, filling every piece of paper I could find. My aunt knew that something extraordinary was happening when I started sketching detailed scenes on paper. She then started to sign me up for drawing competitions. I remember getting third place in one at the age of five. I did not have the opportunity to study art or drawing as my family did not think it was a promising career, but I continued to draw in my free time. I graduated from ITE (Dover) with a Higher Nitec in information technology in 2001 and completed a diploma in sound and audio engineering at SAE Creative Media Institute in 2004. I then got a job as a video editor with a local media production company. During my employment, I chanced upon videos about “Orange County Choppers”, an American company which specialises in custom-built motorcycles, and started to gain interest in airbrush painting. Out of curiosity, I bought an airbrush painting starter kit and started picking up skills via YouTube. My passion for airbrush painting grew. I attempted to start a small business and began painting motorbikes for some friends. One of my clients was from Yew Heng Group, a local auto dealer, who saw my potential. I gradually started a partnership with Yew Heng Group to set up Paint Extreme in 2010. Today, I have two staff members under me. The bulk of our business comes from painting bicycle frames and racing helmets. We also paint items such as sculptures and various 3D-printed objects. Airbrush painting is painstaking work. The process begins with preparation, which includes sanding off old paint and spraying primer onto the object. Colours are then mixed according to the client’s preference, and the object is masked with tape before painting. Airbrush artistry demands an acute eye for detail and a steady hand, as artists delicately manipulate colours, shading and gradients to create stunning visual effects. It is not just about evenly coating surfaces with paint; it’s about achieving exceptional finishes, protecting against corrosion, and enhancing aesthetics. Depending on the design, I may use a small or big air-powered tool to accurately apply paint while adjusting for different materials and conditions. I then do a quality check before spraying the topcoat. Drying takes approximately 48 hours before a second round of checks is done. Should there be any blemishes, I will fine-sand the object and polish it to achieve the optimal finishing. It is then ready for delivery or collection. Success did not come easy. I dove into research and development to obtain the ideal paint quality for my clients, struggling to find paints which suited the humid weather in Southeast Asia. I brainstormed about how to fulfil my clients’ design requests. I also never stopped experimenting with different mediums — from acrylic to oil-based paint — to achieve different finishes ranging from single shades to multicoloured “chameleon” effects. I believe I have explored and learnt tremendously throughout my 17-year career. One significant achievement would be the opportunity to complete a project for the Malaysian royal family in 2019, which won me many repeat clients. Another would be collaborating with Mr Jahan Loh, a contemporary artist based in Singapore. Jahan designed and I painted a helmet for local singer JJ Lin. We also collaborated on another helmet for beer brand Heineken at the 2017 Singapore Grand Prix. In 2019, indoor skydiving company GoAirborne Macau contacted me to paint helmets for their crew. It was also a privilege to paint the helmet for Singaporean racing driver Yuey Tan in 2022. I am thankful that my family is very supportive of my career and in future I hope to be able to gain more international recognition for my work. For anyone who is interested in entering the airbrush painting industry, the most important aspect is to have passion and creativity. Also, do not take any shortcuts to reduce the time taken to complete a project — quality is of the utmost importance. ABOUT THE WRITER: Eric Ng Jun Wei, 41, is a professional airbrush artist.

From winning a tapas competition in Spain and a Michelin star in Singapore, to launching a failed pop-up restaurant, one must love both the good and bad to thrive in the Food & Beverage business, he writes. I studied electronic and computer engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic. During that period, I was a part-time cook at Fish & Co. My parents were not keen on me joining the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry as they saw how tiring it was, but I enjoyed the camaraderie in the kitchen and wanted to try out the job. I graduated in 2011 and after National Service enrolled in a Workforce Skills Qualifications diploma in food services (culinary arts) at Shatec. My mum encouraged me, despite knowing it would be tough — she knew how stubborn I was! In 2015, near the end of my course, I applied for the 8th Spanish Gastronomy Training Programme offered by the Spanish government. I got selected and was off to Valladolid, northwest Spain, for six months after graduating. We spent the first three months studying the Spanish language and cuisine. We were also attached to Tapas restaurants and worked there after school, including our off days. I was placed at a tapas bar called Villa Paramesa Tapas. It was challenging working from 6pm until closing. Sometimes we ended at 2am, but serving 200-300 people a night was satisfying, especially with just four in the kitchen. The next three months, I interned at one-star Michelin restaurant La Botica de Matapozuelos, near Valladolid. We would pick herbs from the back garden. Sometimes we foraged for berries or visited the farm at our chef’s home to catch chickens and harvest vegetables. It was a chef’s dream come true. We ended the stint with a competition to create a tapa dish, and I won. For the first time, I felt I was good at something. I returned to Singapore fully intending to work in Spain. Shortly after, chef Rishi Naleendra, who started Cheek by Jowl restaurant at Boon Tat Street, invited me for an interview. I had always wanted to visit him as he, too, had interned at La Botica. I joined his restaurant in 2016 while waiting for an opening in Spain. That year, the famed Michelin guide launched in Singapore. Chef Rishi asked if I could stay and help the restaurant achieve a star, and I agreed. We managed to do that in 2017. It is still one of my proudest moments. We kept the star for three years. During that time, I rose from commis chef to head chef in 2018. In 2019, we rebranded as Cheek Bistro and I stayed until end-2020 — the year Covid-19 hit. I had gotten engaged that year and wanted a change. Shatec had offered me a training instructor role and my fiancee and I agreed that I should accept it. We got married the year after. As an instructor, I truly enjoyed spending time with my students, but I still longed for the kitchen. So, I sold homemade char siew tarts, cookies and fish stuffed with laksa paste on my off days. I also created my own brand, FullCircle by J.man — a nickname Chef Rishi gave me. I found a business partner and left Shatec to set up FullCircle as a pop-up restaurant at Thye Hong Centre on Leng Kee Road. It operated from August 2022 to August 2023. I was happy to showcase my own cooking style. But there were challenges — from staff shortages to poor sales because of our location. After a year, the partnership ended. I took a break to refresh myself mentally. What I’ve learned from this experience is that it’s okay to fail and know when to stop. It was not an easy pill to swallow, but a necessary one. Things are looking up. In November, I entered another tapas competition in Spain and placed fifth out of 16 international contestants. In future, I plan on opening a Singapore-style tapas restaurant. My parents are proud of my achievements, and they tell their friends about me. My wife has grown to understand and support my work. She’s the backbone of our family, taking care of our two-year-old boy on top of her job as a teacher. I believe that to thrive in the F&B industry you must love both the good and bad. If you realise you only love cooking, then keep it as a hobby. ABOUT THE WRITER: Jay Teo Junxiang, 33, is the owner of pop-up Asian cuisine brand FullCircle by J.man, which is currently on a hiatus, but has a pop-up event planned at the Arts House from Dec 21-23. He has worked in kitchens since the age of 16 and has been a professional chef for eight years.

    "article_content": "Voices I refer to the article “Funeral industry encouraged to provide greater price transparency, clarity on packages” (Nov 17). I refer to the article “ Funeral industry encouraged to provide greater price transparency, clarity on packages ” (Nov 17). A report by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) last month highlighted the lack of transparency over funeral costs in Singapore. It also encouraged consumers to pre-plan funeral arrangements where possible. The main selling point of pre-paid funerals is that you can plan them to your preferences, without the emotional pressure of dealing with a loved one’s death. However, given Singaporeans’ general unfamiliarity with the funeral business, as pointed out by the CCCS report, it might be wiser not to make pre-plans unless certain safeguards are put in place. First, a central registry of pre-paid funeral contracts should be established to enable consumers, family members and funeral directors to expeditiously verify the details of existing contracts. Individual funeral service providers should also be required to keep records of pre-paid funerals. As a former funeral professional, I have encountered many occasions when a person died and their family members were not aware that a plan existed. A 2005 parliamentary inquiry on the funeral industry in Victoria, Australia, found that its system of self-regulation was “unsatisfactory” given the diversity of businesses and lack of agreed industry-wide standards. It added that a voluntary code of practice would not be beneficial without the “support of legislation”. Recommendations from the inquiry have been enshrined in law since 2006. In Singapore, where almost every funeral company is a small or medium-sized enterprise, pre-paid funds meant for future use could well be spent on existing costs. One also cannot rule out the possibility that a firm might exit the business before a package can be used. As such, monies paid in advance for funeral packages should be placed in an independent investment trust fund, which a funeral director cannot access until the death has occurred. The interest earned from an investment fund could also be used to fund funerals for the destitute. While pre-planning does allow consumers to make informed decisions, the continual lack of transparency in funeral costs remains a barrier in that decision-making process. Thus, unless the authorities make it mandatory that prices of funeral goods and services are made transparent and itemised and shared with consumers before a contract is signed, there is a distinct imbalance in favour of an unregulated industry. Such safeguards could be legalised under the ambit of a “Funeral Act”, to govern the entire industry. Presently, if one’s concern is the cost of a funeral, it is better to deposit funds in a nominated bank account rather than with a funeral company. Consumers can also consider listing out detailed ideas about a funeral in a will after having consulted a funeral firm. This will allow them to reap the benefits of a pre-paid funeral without the drawbacks of being locked into a contract that might eventually not be honoured.

    "article_content": "Voices When I tell people I work at Hyundai, they assume that I work in a car workshop. But after explaining that I assemble electric vehicles (EVs) using robots in a smart factory, their interest is piqued. Mr Muhammad Aliff Adha, 33, is a production supervisor at Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Muhammad Aliff Adha, 33, recounts how he overcame his initial struggles in school to excel in engineering at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). That foundation later helped him transition from building jet engines to assembling electric vehicles at Hyundai’s robot-operated smart factory. When I tell people I work at Hyundai, they assume that I work in a car workshop. But after explaining that I assemble electric vehicles (EVs) using robots in a smart factory, their interest is piqued. I’m proud to say that I’m part of the Korean company’s only EV manufacturing team in Singapore. I wouldn’t be where I am today, if not for my parents’ advice and a supportive learning environment. When I was in secondary school, I was disappointed when my N-Level results weren’t good enough for me to progress to Secondary 5. My only option then was the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). I wasn’t keen, but with my parents’ advice, I applied for an engineering course at the former Bukit Batok campus in 2007. I had difficulty adapting to ITE initially. Thankfully, my lecturers were very patient, guiding me in my lessons and believing that I can do well in my studies. I soon found out that I enjoyed engineering and hands-on learning. I graduated from my Nitec in Precision Engineering (Machining) in 2009 with a perfect grade point average, and was offered an Economic Development Board (EDB) Scholarship to join the Technical Engineer Diploma (TED) in Machine Technology at ITE. I accepted without hesitation. Though the TED course was more theoretical, the lecturers were very supportive and worked tirelessly to ensure that I understood what was being taught. This motivated me to do my best. In 2011, I topped my TED cohort and received a Gold Course Medal. My career journey started in 2014 soon after I completed my National Service. I found out that jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce Singapore was willing to accept fresh graduates from ITE. I applied and was accepted in January 2014. I started out as an assembly technician for commercial aircraft engines. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The aviation sector was badly affected, and I was retrenched in August 2021, after 7.5 years. That was the lowest point of my career. Fortunately, just before the retrenchment exercise, my TED lecturer contacted me and told me there was a career opportunity in Hyundai. I jumped at the chance and was given the role as a senior assembly technician in September 2021. As part of the pioneer batch, I was sent to Daegu, South Korea for three months of training. There, I learnt how to assemble EVs. Being in a smart factory was mind-blowing. I had to work alongside robots and use smart technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things. Working with robots is not as straightforward as one might think. I have to ensure that these high-tech machines are working well during production and that all parts are delivered on time to each step on the assembly line. This was quite challenging for me at first as I was used to manual work from my previous job. I had to ensure that I was familiar enough with the robots so I could figure out what the issue was when an error occurred. Then I would rectify it, move the robot to its starting position and restart the process. I also needed to do this quickly enough to minimise delays. Thankfully, Hyundai provided me with intensive training on how to do basic troubleshooting. Once I got the hang of it, I enjoyed and appreciated the integration of technology in the assembly process. It excites me every time I see how the robots assemble cars. It feels like I’m stepping into a different world! Instead of humans, we have robots moving car components around and assembling them. This greatly reduces our workload and improves productivity. Once completed, these newly assembled cars can be test-driven at the 620m-long track located on the rooftop. After 1.5 years, I was promoted to production supervisor. My duties now include ensuring that the production line runs smoothly and manpower planning. I am learning new things every day, and in future I hope to leverage my technical skills to come up with ideas on new technologies, improve existing ones and drive innovation. No doubt, robots can perform certain tasks better than humans, but tasks that require critical thinking and interpersonal skills will always require a human touch. ABOUT THE WRITER: Muhammad Aliff Adha, 33, is a production supervisor at Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore. He has nearly 10 years of manufacturing experience in both the aviation and automotive industries.

Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Ms Makesvary Krishnasamy, 22, recounts how she stumbled into a greenery and landscaping course at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Over time, she developed a love for plants and the outdoors — much to her family’s surprise — and is now a landscape supervisor deployed at the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Wonders. When I was younger, I wanted to help people and thought I would pursue a career in social services. Now, I help plants instead! I am a landscape supervisor at BNL Services, an environmental services company which provides landscape, cleaning, and waste management services. My team and I look after and inspect the trees and plants at Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Wonders. A typical day will see me check various trees for defects which might lead to falling branches, or even the whole tree. Once a defect has been spotted, I would need to rectify it. For example, if I spot dead branches on a tree, I will get my team to remove them. I love looking after plants and trees and I truly enjoy my work. It wasn’t always like this, though. My N-Level results weren’t great and of the 12 courses I listed in my ITE application, a Nitec in Urban Greenery & Landscape was my last choice. As fate would have it, it was the course I got into at ITE College East. I entered the course in 2018, having no idea what it would be like. By actively participating in class and horticultural activities organised by the school and industry, I slowly developed an interest. Having spent time outdoors and figuring out what makes plants tick, I discovered that, “Hey, it’s fun working with plants!”. My lecturer also played a big part in my career choice. Her passion for plants really inspired me — she was the one who showed me how important plants are. She gave me a lot of support while I was studying and created more opportunities for me to gain exposure and build my network in the landscaping industry. My family was surprised when they found out about my interest. They definitely didn’t expect me to be a plant lover since I wasn’t exposed much to nature when I was younger. Once they got used to the idea, they supported my decision to turn this interest into a career. Now, they are proud and happy that I choose to do what I love. After graduating from my Nitec course, I enrolled in the newly-introduced ITE Work-Study Diploma (WSDip) in Arboriculture & Horticulture in 2020. That was when I joined BNL Services. Stepping into the work environment as a young trainee, I found it a challenge to work with people of varying field experiences. But I took my time to learn from everyone. I worked hard to prove my capabilities and made sure I bonded with my team so we could all learn from each other. The WSDip course taught me more than just technical knowledge and skills. It also prepared me for the working world by teaching me how to interact with people from different age groups. This particular skillset keeps things interesting for me as well — I meet many people with diverse talents and perspectives in this industry and I really enjoy it. It gives me an opportunity to work with and learn from them. I may work with plants, but there is plenty of human interaction as well! I stayed on with BNL after completing my WSDip in 2022. I’m grateful to the company for giving me the opportunity to kick start my career in this industry. A highlight of my career so far was getting the chance to represent BNL and showcase the National Parks Board’s digitalisation capabilities to National Development Minister Desmond Lee at this year’s Green Thumbs exhibition. I know many girls would prefer not to pursue a career like mine. In this line, you can’t be afraid of working outdoors. As for me, I love being outside and bugs don’t bother me at all. Tree falls happen more frequently during the rainy season, so you’ve got to be prepared to work in the rain too. Personally, I prefer working without a raincoat as I find them quite restrictive. My love for nature goes beyond enjoying beautiful scenery. To me, plants and trees are living things, just like us. So instead of serving humans, I choose to serve plants and trees, despite having to do so under the hot sun for hours. ABOUT THE WRITER: Makesvary Krishnasamy, 22, is a landscape supervisor at BNL Services. Though she is just starting out in the industry, she hopes to be a plant and tree specialist in the future. She is currently pursuing a certified arborist licence with the International Society of Arboriculture. At home, she is “mum” to a growing collection of money plants.

Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Ms Kelly Cheah, 31, recounts her unconventional journey from aspiring engineer to head pastry chef at an award-winning cafe. Initially lukewarm about baking, she fell in love with creating pastries and rose up the kitchen ranks, overcoming challenges along the way. Despite being a science student and aspiring to follow my father's footsteps as an engineer, my education took an unexpected turn when I ventured into pastry-making. It was not an easy decision, especially when most people wanted to be doctors, lawyers, or engineers. I was young at the time, and rather than follow a prescribed path, I wanted to try something different. If it didn’t work out, at least I would have no regrets. My dad, who has always been very supportive of me, suggested that since I love to eat, why not learn how to bake? So, after my SPM exams in Malaysia (the equivalent of the O-Levels) in 2009, I took a gap year to travel around Asia to figure out my next move. To be honest, I didn’t have a huge passion for baking at first, but I did want to get a diploma. I went to several pastry schools in Singapore to enquire, but as a foreigner then, it was not cheap to study and stay here. In the end, I chose Shatec because it is a well-known institute, and the fees were more affordable. After starting my diploma course in pastry and baking in 2011, I discovered a love for the art of pastries. I enjoy creating beautiful and delicious desserts to complement a good meal. I graduated in 2012 and started as a commis chef at French restaurant DB Bistro & Oyster Bar at Marina Bay Sands that year. It was my first time in a professional kitchen. I was taught the importance of being curious and asking “why”. I learned this the hard way when I was reprimanded for not knowing the reasons behind my actions and just going through the motions. I also mastered the art of working quickly, as DB Bistro often faced intense rushes during festive seasons. This taught me to multitask and to stay composed even in the face of demanding chefs. The experience prepared me for the high-pressure kitchen at Joel Robuchon Restaurant, which I joined in 2014. There, I delved into the intricacies of French cuisine. I started as a commis 1 chef before being promoted to demi chef in 2015 and later chef de partie in 2016. As all the recipes were in French, reading them became an endeavour that not only expanded my culinary repertoire but also my linguistic abilities. I was entrusted with managing desserts and the petit four trolleys, which comprised over 20 bite-sized and classic French desserts that had to be prepared before dinner service began. In 2018, I joined Tarte by Cheryl Koh, a small takeaway shop at Shaw Centre that I helped transform into an award-winning pastry haven. I have been Tarte’s head pastry chef since January 2022. Balancing the demands of haute cuisine with the challenges of building a brand has been both daunting and immensely rewarding. My day starts at 7am, working in the kitchen to complete morning preparations with my team. Then, I ensure the dining area is ready for guests. I experiment with new desserts every week — regardless of whether they are intended for public release. This commitment to innovation remains a pivotal part of my role. We also take pride in using premium ingredients. I could be working with shine muscat grapes from Korea one day and sollies figs from France the next. I believe this approach is what makes our kitchen a culinary hub. On top of that, I'm learning how to manage and make the brand profitable. I've had to delve into budgeting and balance sheets, which were unfamiliar concepts when I was just a chef. Leading a team and earning their respect is a new skill I'm also developing. At Tarte, I must interact with guests, suppliers, and my colleagues, and this journey is teaching me the art of effective communication. As for my dad, he is very proud that I didn’t give up halfway and continued with my pastry journey. To aspiring pastry chefs, my advice is to embrace challenges, relish the joy of discovery, seek mentorship, and cultivate a love for the craft. Remember, every setback is a stepping stone to triumph. Bon Appetit! ABOUT THE WRITER: Kelly Cheah, 31, is a Penang native who became a Singapore Permanent Resident in 2017. She is head pastry chef at Tarte by Cheryl Koh, and enjoys pilates, yoga and checking out cafes and restaurants whenever she can.

    "article_content": "Voices As a student, I envisioned myself entering the creative or media industry. Ms Tsuri Xie is a vinyl installer at Vos Automotive Styling. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Ms Tsuri Xie, 34, recounts her career transition from a marketing job to installing vinyl wraps on cars. Drawn to the creative process, she picked up skills and managed to win fans on social media by sharing videos of her work. Negative comments, as well as chauvinism from those who think women know little about cars, don’t discourage her from pursuing her craft, she writes. I graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts with a Communication Design degree in 2010. As a student, I envisioned myself entering the creative or media industry. I found myself in marketing instead, and after some years landed a senior role in an international company. Despite the attractive compensation, nothing quite satisfied the itch to create. Along the way, I began investing in startups. In 2016, I invested in a now defunct automotive company called Fox Motorworks. That was where I first encountered vinyl wrapping, and the process intrigued me. I began playing around with scrap vinyl material, but not very seriously because it was a lot harder than it looked. Amid the pandemic in 2020, I left my job to set up a digital marketing firm. The founders of my current workplace, Vos Automotive, approached me then to join them as a marketer. It was a bold move for me, but the opportunity was a breath of fresh air. Shortly after, I closed my venture and joined Vos as a founding member. Like many businesses, we found it hard to hire skilled labour. This was my chance to start learning vinyl wrapping more seriously. At the end of 2020, I spoke to Vos’ owners about becoming a vinyl wrap installer. They gave me their blessing. I began by watching online videos and referencing those techniques against what other seasoned installers were teaching me. I also joined online communities where professional installers share tips with one another. That same year, I started recording videos myself at work for my own review. A friend suggested uploading them onto TikTok. I didn’t think too much of it but did it anyway. Before long, they grew in popularity, garnering millions of views. This gave me the assurance to push myself further. There were also many negative comments, which would affect my mental state adversely, but I tried to take them constructively as much as possible. I enjoy seeing every car as a creative canvas. Initially, being able to even complete a job gave me an unparalleled sense of achievement. After wrapping professionally for three years — and completing over a hundred projects — a finished design is still extremely satisfying to me. Some of my more memorable designs include a graphic anime-styled wrap, a BMW 4 series wrapped in marble print and a Mercedes G-Wagon wrapped in faux leather vinyl. A typical day involves planning and measuring the materials used, cleaning, designing and installing. The schedule can be demanding, especially during peak seasons. Fortunately, I have a team to assist me. Many of my teammates are my teachers too. New methods are always being discovered. Making progress means being willing to learn — never become the old dog that can’t learn new tricks. Unfortunately, chauvinism is very real in the male-dominated automotive industry. I have encountered many people who assume that women know little about cars. I’ve found that I need to prove my worth in this industry, as some clients do not trust a woman to work on their vehicles. Creative work is challenging work. While we strive for perfection, anything handmade is hardly perfect. Sadly, not everyone appreciates this and can be overly demanding. Additionally, prejudice against blue-collared work exists in Singapore. I have experienced many white-collared professionals talking down to my team and I. In fact, some who acted like my close friends despised me for going into blue-collared work. There was much chatter about me when I entered this trade. This does not stop me from pursuing my passion. To me, every wrap is a work of art. Seeing a satisfied owner further assures me that my decision was worth it. I’m thankful for my friends and family who truly supported me. Today, these are the same people who are telling their friends now they know me personally. To those wanting to enter the trade, be prepared to work on your posture or end up getting endless backaches. Be warned, too, that it is not a financially rewarding trade — the business is hardly scalable and anyone looking to make a quick buck should turn away. Passion is the only thing that will keep your fire going.

Bicycle mechanic Alfred Goh working on a bicycle in his store, Inkedmechanic. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Alfred Goh Jie Bin, 38, recounts his unconventional path to becoming a bicycle workshop owner. Mr Goh, who dropped out of school to support his family, learnt the trade from the ground up and later upgraded his skills in the United States. After working at various bicycle shops, and a brief stint in scuba diving, he finally opened his own business in 2019. I have loved bicycles since young. Cycling meant freedom as money was hard to come by. I could get around without worrying about transport fares or timing. My father died in 1996 when I was 12. My mum had to work, and I took a part-time job as a banquet waiter to help with finances. I would finish late and was too tired for school the next day. As a result, I got retained in Secondary 2 and left school during my repeat year, when I was 15. My mum was disappointed, but the upside was that I was earning an income which gave us a better quality of life. I also had more time to hang around bicycle shops. Slowly, I learnt the ins and outs of the trade. I worked my way up from sales to become a bicycle mechanic in 2002. In 2010, after eight years in the business, I wanted to further my technical knowledge and shop managing skills. I signed up for courses at United Bicycle Institute, an American school for bicycle mechanics. I travelled to their Ashland, Oregon campus on my own dime. My three weeks there cost me around S$15,000, but I felt it was a worthwhile investment. I took a professional repair and shop operation course, followed by various advanced certificates. Before this, I had not travelled much other than visiting family in Malaysia. It was challenging getting used to staying in a lodging with the rest of my coursemates. During lessons, I also had to learn industry terms not commonly used in Singapore. Cooking, laundry, grocery shopping and house parties became my life for those weeks. Armed with new knowledge and skills, I returned to Singapore looking forward to growing my employer’s business. In 2011, I had the chance to manage their shop operations, but that was short-lived as they closed down two years later. With no education to depend on, I started exploring other options. I did odd jobs such as being a hotel houseman and guest service officer. In mid-2013, I saw an advertisement for a scuba diving apprenticeship, which piqued my interest. I joined a dive centre and worked my way up to become an instructor and later an equipment distribution manager. Sadly, I left in 2016 seeking a more stable and financially rewarding venture. I returned to the cycling world, joining up-and-coming shops. I was excited to be back knowing I had the skills and experience to take their business forward. Starting over was difficult, but I persevered. At that point, I was 33 and married. I wished I could do more. In 2019, I took a leap of faith and opened my own shop. To say that running a business is challenging would be an understatement. The struggles worsened when Covid-19 happened shortly after opening. Fortunately, the circuit breaker and border closures encouraged more people to start cycling. With more customers, I faced new challenges being a one-man operation. To my surprise, former co-workers and customers offered to help. Some had been financially hit and volunteered to do odd jobs. It was a small side income for them, but I was happy to help. With life mostly back to normal now, business is not as brisk as before. Returning customers and recommendations keep me afloat. I am not highly educated so running a small business is a constant challenge. I am lucky I have the support of family and friends whenever I stumble on complex issues such as legal matters. A typical day starts with replying customer messages. Wrench work follows, which takes up most of my time, but I do have one staff helping with odd jobs. My day ends with replying to more messages. Staying in touch is vital to get more business. More than two decades ago, I was just a kid cycling for fun. I am still in that world, but happy to be behind the counter. My advice to those looking to enter the industry is to have tenacity and be content. When I was younger, I used to envy others’ success but now I am much happier spending time with family and friends than trying to impress others.

    "article_content": "Voices I graduated with a diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2011 and planned to further my studies. Mr Kwek Siew Bo, 39, is a deputy engineering maintenance manager at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Kwek Siew Bo, 39, recounts how he had to start working after finishing polytechnic to support his family. Despite giving up his further studies, Mr Kwek found a rewarding career at SMRT, where he was involved in setting up a new train depot and delving into the intricacies of operating new trains. I graduated with a diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2011 and planned to further my studies. My family, however, was struggling to make ends meet and could not afford university tuition fees. So, I joined the workforce straight after graduation to help support them. I was disappointed, but little did I realise that this would set me on a path to something meaningful and rewarding. As I was strongly inclined towards hands-on work in school, I started my career as a technician at Hewlett-Packard, working in a team responsible for producing printer heads. After my contract ended, I joined SMRT Trains in 2014 as an assistant engineer. Part of my role involved doing preventive and corrective maintenance. It involved tasks such as troubleshooting faults, replacing worn and defective parts, and periodic cleaning of equipment. Switching industries and adjusting to a new environment and demands was challenging initially. Fortunately, the company provided me with a six-month training programme to equip me with the skills necessary to perform my role. Leading a team of two technical officers proved challenging too, as effective communication with other teams was essential to support train service. Over time, I overcame these communication challenges by taking notes and clarifying with my supervisors and colleagues any areas I was unsure of to better understand how to perform the work competently. In 2017, I had the opportunity to help establish a new base of operations in the newly built Tuas Depot. I volunteered to be part of the pioneer trainborne signalling team there. Setting up a new depot was exhilarating. It involved installing new workspaces and workflows to commission trains with new Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems installed. Simply put, CBTC is a railway signalling system that uses telecommunications for train management and control. It is an upgrade from traditional fixed block signalling systems which detect trains in discrete sections of the track. Trains had to be retrofitted for the new system and I was involved in the commissioning of the equipment needed. I also ensured that it was properly installed and helped to test it to make sure it was functional. Every early morning, before the launch of the day’s train service, we needed to make sure there were sufficient serviceable trains. I was promoted last July to the position of deputy engineering maintenance manager and am now leading trainborne signalling and communications maintenance operations at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. I now supervise a team of assistant engineers and technical officers to manage train-related maintenance. Not only do I ensure that we have the resources required, I’m also responsible for their safety and welfare. I assist my team with the more complex faults that may require an experienced eye. I also provide recommendations to the management regarding train faults and recovery. This significant change in my life has opened doors to strengthen relationships with colleagues and build wide networks in the industry. My previous supervisor and I now work together as colleagues at the same professional level. It allowed me to attain a greater appreciation for the work my supervisors had done in the past and the challenges they faced. For those considering a career in the rail and public transport industries, I would say there is a world of diverse opportunities. My career in SMRT has enabled me to meet, interact and learn from professionals from various fields, including the Land Transport Authority, our signalling system supplier Thales, and other contractors. I’ve also had the chance to delve into the intricacies of operating new trains and acquire fresh skills that I was not acquainted with previously. I may not have been able to further my studies after graduating many years ago, but when I look back, I am glad it led me to this. There is never a dull moment, and the prospect of networking and continuously learning with professionals from different domains, knowing that at the end of the day, commuters are the ultimate beneficiaries with safe, reliable, and comfortable journeys, has made this job truly fascinating, meaningful and rewarding. ABOUT THE WRITER: Kwek Siew Bo, 39, is a deputy engineering maintenance manager at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. His hobbies include swimming, playing badminton and going to the movies.

Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Ho Boon Ping, 34, who started an air-con servicing business in 2019, recounts the highs and lows of his journey. After seeing how blue-collar roles are in demand overseas, he says that they deserve the same recognition in Singapore. When I was young, I thought studies were not important and neglected them. Not surprisingly, my N-Level results were not great. While browsing through the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) website for courses I could apply for, it occurred to me that with Singapore being such a hot and humid country, we can’t live without air-conditioning. So I opted for a Nitec in Facility Technology (Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration), which I started in April 2010. During the course, I went on an exchange programme at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, where I saw women and many locals in blue-collar jobs. I was even more surprised to hear that plumbers, electricians, and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) technicians were in demand in Australia. It made me hope that such jobs can achieve the same level of recognition in Singapore. In May 2013, I started working for Stulz (Singapore) — a German air-conditioning services firm — as a service engineer. During my interview, I frankly told the hiring manager that I did not have much experience. He was more than willing to train me, so I got the job. There, I learnt a lot about computer room air-conditioning and how temperature, humidity and airflow can affect machine performance. Stulz also sent me to Hamburg, Germany, for a week of training at its headquarters. It was an eye-opening experience. There, I also noticed that many of their technicians are locals as well. I stayed on with Stulz for six years, during which I also completed a part-time Higher Nitec in Marine and Offshore Technology as well as a part-time diploma in Building Services and Fire Safety from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. In 2018, my sister was hospitalised for eight weeks due to a lung infection. She couldn’t work after that and had to depend on the family. That was when I started thinking about leaving my comfort zone to help take care of my sister. I didn’t plan much — I resigned in May 2019 to look after her and rest. It was then that I decided to set up my own business as I love hands-on work and going to different job locations. In December 2019, I started Comfort Cooling Services, which provides air-conditioning and repair services. Unfortunately, Covid-19 struck just two months later. During the lockdown, I did some freelance work in building and servicing to get by. From there, I slowly built my customer base. I had zero connections so it wasn’t until mid-2021 that I started getting regular clients. I know many people are sceptical when engaging contractors to service their air-conditioners. I told myself I had to build up a business that provides honest and quality service. My ITE lecturers taught me good installation work, and I used that to guide me while building my business. When my customers engage my services, I won’t push unnecessary add-ons such as topping up refrigerant gas annually. This is a common contractor suggestion that is not necessary as long as the air-conditioner is installed properly and working fine. A typical day will see me servicing air-conditioners at different locations and sometimes meeting new customers, who get to know of me through word-of-mouth. It’s very satisfying for me as I feel that I learn something new every day, even though I have been doing this for a while. My biggest challenge is having to get over my fear of heights, especially when I have customers in older Housing and Development Board flats with no air-conditioner ledge. I have to use a safety harness to climb out of the flat to check or top up the refrigerant. It gives me great satisfaction when my customers give me good feedback on my work, and when I manage to solve their air-conditioning problems. To me, machines can’t do a hands-on job like mine. You need to be able to think on your feet. I feel that there will be great demand for skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and so on), especially when fewer people are taking up such jobs. For those thinking of going into this line, have faith in your skill and do what you are happy with. ABOUT THE WRITER: Ho Boon Ping, 34, runs his own business — Comfort Cooling Services — and provides air-conditioning and handyman services such as plumbing, replacing of taps, water tank accessories, and electrical switches.

    "article_content": "Voices I was recently retrenched. This came as a shock to me as I had been in a senior leadership role for nearly three years and had brought in significant revenue for my employer — a global company in the creative industry. This audio is AI-generated. I was recently retrenched. This came as a shock to me as I had been in a senior leadership role for nearly three years and had brought in significant revenue for my employer — a global company in the creative industry. I was informed that the reason for my retrenchment was “financial challenges” and it was not a “reflection of my past performance or contributions”. I asked about severance benefits, and was told I would not be getting any because the company was “not in a financially healthy position”. I have appealed for a payout in line with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s recommendations — generally up to a months’ salary per year of service for employees who have served for at least two years — and am still waiting for a response. Retrenchment benefits are not enshrined in Singapore’s labour laws. As mentioned, MOM gives only broad guidelines. Any severance amount depends on what is provided for in one’s employment contract, or paid out of good will — not because of legislation. Sadly, my contract didn’t include any such provision. A friend urged me to speak with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management who referred me to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. Both officers who spoke with me were sympathetic but ultimately said the same thing my company’s Human Resources told me — that they can only point my company to best practices — and could not enforce anything. My story isn’t the only one. The recent high-profile retrenchments at Lazada and Google have exposed a weakness in Singapore’s labour laws, which experts acknowledge are geared towards supporting companies. In the case of Google, affected staff were luckily offered a package that was “comparable” to retrenchment benefits in the United States. In Lazada’s case, employees were offered two weeks’ salary per year of service. The Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union, which represents its workers, is pushing for more. For perspective, I’ve worked as a Singaporean in Britain and Australia. Both these countries do have workplace laws that protect employees in the event of retrenchment. In Australia for example, if you are made redundant, there is provision of at least four weeks’ pay if you have worked with a company for at least a year. In Britain, employees get a payout if they’ve been working for a company for two years or more. This ranges from half a week’s pay to one-and-a-half week’s pay per full year of work, depending on age. These practices give employees a safety net so that they can continue meeting financial obligations while searching for new jobs. As a country that has ambitions to be a regional business hub, I urge MOM to strengthen the legal protection for employees here. If we are unable to strike a fair balance in the employment relationship, I worry about how competitive we will be in attracting and retaining global talents.

    "article_content": "Voices It has been 16 years since I first picked up a pair of hair scissors, and I’ve not looked back since. This audio is AI-generated. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Noel Ng, 31, recounts his decision to study hairdressing at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) and his journey towards becoming a salon owner managing a team of 24 stylists. It has been 16 years since I first picked up a pair of hair scissors, and I’ve not looked back since. In secondary school, I wasn’t motivated in my studies and struggled to pass my exams. My best subject was Design & Technology. This made me consider doing something that was skills-based at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), instead of continuing with my O-Levels. A new hairdressing course at ITE College East caught my eye. At first, my parents were sceptical when I told them of my choice. They felt hairdressing was not a reputable industry and were worried for me. I explained to them the possibilities if I became a successful hairstylist, and they relented. Having seen how far I’ve come, I think they are relieved that I’m doing well. I started my Nitec in Hair Fashion and Design in 2008. It was tough at first — cutting hair is not as easy as it seems! My lecturers kept lessons enjoyable though. The facilities at ITE — including a fully-equipped salon where we could learn everything from hair styling to colouring — also helped keep me motivated, as did the support I got. Back then, I practised on my family and friends — cutting their hair along a HDB corridor, with perspiration and hair all over my face. I supposed they liked it since they came back for more. That gave me more confidence to pursue my “art”. In 2010, I was selected to be part of Team Singapore at the 8th WorldSkills Asean in Bangkok and pit my hairdressing skills against other youths in the region. I had to train intensively before that, and I’m proud that it paid off — I earned a Gold medal. In 2011, I travelled to London for the WorldSkills’ international leg. This meant competing with the top-performing youths of each participating country. It was an eye-opening experience being able to represent Singapore on the global stage. I was glad to bring home a Medallion for Excellence. I completed my first Nitec in 2010, and graduated with my second in hair and scalp therapy in 2012. My first job was a hair assistant. I was later promoted to stylist and moved around a few salons over the next few years. However, it was always my dream to open my own salon. In 2016, that dream finally came true. With some savings, and plenty of support from my family, I opened Harts Salon in Bugis. As a salon owner, I have a lot more responsibilities. I have to provide for my team, get customers in, manage people, and generally make sure things run smoothly. To attract customers, I turned to social media marketing, showcasing our services and whatever was trending in the industry. The effort paid off and soon, I was getting back-to-back appointments. Before I expanded, I was attending to three to seven customers a day. It was a challenge to meet their expectations and I did worry at times that they would not like what I have done for them. These days, my challenge lies more with managing and training my team of stylists. I started out with a team of four and I’ve steadily expanded it to 24 across three salons. With a large team like this, it’s not easy paying attention to the individual stylist’s performance, but I try my best. I’m still growing and seeking out new ideas so I can stay ahead in the industry, for example by keeping in touch with the latest hairstyle trends. Operations-wise, I make sure there is transparency, and emphasise the need for good customer service among my team. As an ITE graduate, I’m committed to nurturing talent and providing opportunities for fellow alumni in the industry. For example, before Covid-19 hit I was going back to ITE on an ad-hoc basis to share my experience with students. I have also hired some ITE grads at my salon, and I'm proud that a few of them have advanced to higher positions elsewhere! For those looking to join the industry, you must enjoy hairdressing. When you start out, you are at the bottom rung but with perseverance and determination, you can be successful. ABOUT THE WRITER: Noel Ng, 31, is the owner of Harts Salon located in Bugis. He also co-owns Hint Salon at Tanjong Pagar and Hei Ardour at Orchard Road. He believes that a good hairstylist is like a surgeon operating on hair — and can earn just as much as one. Outside of work, his favourite pastime is searching for good food.

Mr Mohamad Rezza Abdul Malek, 36, is a crew manager and depot controller at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. This audio is AI-generated. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Mohamad Rezza Abdul Malek, 36, recounts the highs and lows of his eight-year career as an SMRT train captain. Now a depot controller, Mr Rezza manages other drivers’ schedules and train routes, but adds that he does miss being in the captain’s seat. I have worked as a police officer and flight attendant, but have always been drawn to trains. I am intrigued by how they move and operate. In 2014, I turned that fascination into a career when I joined SMRT as a train captain. It was a position I stayed in for eight years. As an operator on the North-South Line, my job was to drive trains and rectify any faults that occurred. A shift could start as early as 4.30am. I would usually begin by retrieving equipment such as the train keys, handheld radio, and iPad. I would then proceed to my assigned train and prepare it for service by doing onboard checks, before driving it from the depot to the main line. We began transitioning towards automated trains in 2018. It was a period of adaptation for me as I had to learn how to operate and attend to faults on automated trains. It was also challenging when we upgraded to a new signalling system on the North-South Line that same year. There were a few teething issues which caused delays. This made commuters anxious and frustrated, and I had to remain calm and collected when they approached me. Despite this, I enjoyed my time as a train captain, especially looking out for great views during the golden hours after sunrise and before sunset. Since then, I have had the chance to upgrade my skills and progress in my career at SMRT. Back then, my highest qualification was a Nitec in Precision Engineering (Aerospace), which I received from the Institute of Technical Education Balestier in 2007. Thanks to a work-study programme fully sponsored by SMRT, I was able to complete a diploma in Engineering (Rapid Transit Technology) at Singapore Polytechnic in 2023. It was tough balancing part-time studies for 2.5 years, while doing my job and taking care of my family. Nonetheless, I enjoyed gaining relevant knowledge which helped me in my daily work. I was also fortunate to be sent to Mauritius on a six-month assignment in 2020, where I was part of a team that helped share our knowledge of driving and handling trains with our counterparts there. There, I learnt to adapt fast to a different culture. Being away from my family also taught me to be resilient. The experience also made me feel fortunate to realise that Singaporeans enjoy one of the best public transport systems in the world. In February 2023, I was promoted to crew manager and depot controller at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. I now oversee the train captains’ reporting schedules and control the movement of trains in the depot. This includes ensuring that trains enter service on time and smoothly via a train control system which allows me to set routes within the depot. My new role allows me to manage daily operations, as well as share my knowledge and experience with the junior train captains. At times, I do miss being in the front seat of a train and making announcements to communicate with commuters. It’s fulfilling to see commuters enjoying a safe and smooth ride. My work is mostly deskbound now, but I must constantly be alert and attentive while on duty. A few seconds’ delay in my response to any issue could impact our operations. And although my job requires me to work on the weekends sometimes, I have learnt how to manage my time with my family. They have fully supported every decision I have made, and this has made me strive to be the best at what I do. Working in public transport is rewarding as many people depend on the MRT system to get around. To those who are thinking about joining the transport industry, I would say believe in yourself and give it a try.

Mr Koh Han Jie, 30, poses for a photo in Amber West Restaurant at ITE College West on Jan 26, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Koh Han Jie, 30, recounts his initial reluctance to further his studies, and how he fell in love with the kitchen during an internship. The Institute of Technical Education graduate, who has been a professional chef for eight years, now has his sights set on opening a restaurant. Being a chef was never on my radar until I entered the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). I wanted to work after my N-Levels, but my mother insisted that I continue with my studies. She encouraged me to pick up a skill. So, I enrolled at ITE at 17 and got into a National ITE Course (Nitec) in Western Culinary Arts at ITE Clementi in 2011. Even then, I wasn’t interested at all. I went to school and just hoped to pass. It was in my second year that everything changed. I was serving my culinary internship at a European restaurant in Raffles Place when I discovered that I actually liked cooking. During the six months there, I spent long hours with the chef and realised that this, and the fast-paced environment, created a special bond among the kitchen crew. It sparked my love for cooking and motivated me to do better. After completing my Nitec in 2012, I trained for the 2013 WorldSkills Competition in Leipzig, Germany, where I achieved a Medallion for Excellence. I went on to do my Technical Diploma in Culinary Arts at ITE College West the following year and had the chance to take part in a culinary cook-off organised by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay in 2014. The challenge was only revealed on the day itself — we had to cook eggs in three different ways in 10 minutes. I had then only just learnt the different techniques and even encountered some technical difficulties during the competition. But I won the cook-off and got an internship at Ramsay’s Bread Street Kitchen at Marina Bay Sands for a month. I was very happy and excited. I certainly didn’t expect this win would lead me to more opportunities. I obtained my diploma in 2015 and did a four-month internship at a three-star Michelin restaurant in Valence, France under renowned chef Anne Sophie Pic. It was a good learning experience, but certainly very challenging. I struggled with the French language. I understand basic kitchen terms but to receive instructions in French while keeping up with the fast pace in the kitchen was not easy. However, I did learn a lot about French culture and cuisine, station placing, and new cooking techniques, which helped me during my career. After returning to Singapore, I worked at fine dining restaurant Les Amis for two years before heading Elfuego by Collin’s for three years. My last stint was at French restaurant Ce Soir — I was there for two years and left last November as I plan to set up my own restaurant. This has been a dream of mine since I entered the industry. There are definitely huge risks and challenges that I will face, but setting up a restaurant provides a platform for me to put what I’ve learnt into good use. I also hope that doing so will inspire others to pursue their dreams. I looked at over 50 places before finally finding a suitable one in terms of location and price. If things go smoothly, I look forward to opening in May or June this year. What I enjoy most about cooking is coming up with new dishes and the different ways of executing them. The whole process excites me. I also find that taking part in competitions forces me to think out of the box to create top-level dishes. In the eight years since I entered the industry, I’ve taken part in several competitions: I was the first Singaporean to win the Young Talents Escoffier Asian trophy in 2017 in Hong Kong and the international leg in Zurich, Switzerland the year after. That is probably my proudest moment. As a chef, I normally spend more than 12 hours at work. Often, we sacrifice our personal time, especially during festive periods. Despite this, my love for food and commitment towards my guests are what keep me moving forward. My family are very happy with how far I’ve come, though they do wish they could spend more time with me. Cooking is an art form. It requires a lot of passion. If you intend to enter the industry, you really must love it. My advice — enjoy the process and manage your mental and personal health.

    "published_date": "2024/02/15",
    "author_name": "Alexis Heng Boon Chin",
    "author_url": "https://www.todayonline.com/author/alexis-heng-boon-chin",
    "article_content": "Voices I refer to the article “Baby Steps: 'Toughest period of my life', say women who underwent costly, emotional IVF process. Can more be done to support them?” (Feb 13). This audio is AI-generated. I refer to the article \" Baby Steps: 'Toughest period of my life', say women who underwent costly, emotional IVF process. Can more be done to support them? \" (Feb 13). It stated that some Singaporean couples travel overseas to do pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) of their in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) embryos, due to restrictive regulations at home. Currently, PGS is only open to women who are 35 and above, or those regardless of age who have two or more failed IVF procedures or two or more recurrent pregnancy losses. In 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said only 104 patients had undergone PGS thus far. It is necessary to understand the various drawbacks of PGS and why it is so strictly regulated by MOH. First, patients must be aware that genetic screening can potentially damage their embryo. The technique is highly invasive, involving drilling a hole through the embryo shell and extracting cells for biopsy. This is potentially harmful and can impair its development. Experts have pointed out that studies claiming no ill effects of PGS on embryos are often based on testing of excellent high-quality embryos rather than more \"delicate\" lower-quality embryos that might suffer more. Because older women tend to have weaker lower-quality embryos, these may be more prone to damage upon testing. Second, genetic testing is prone to misdiagnosis, which could result in patients discarding viable embryos that can give rise to a healthy baby. This is because the testing involves extracting cells only from the outer embryo layer that produces the placenta and umbilical cord, which is not representative of the inner embryo layer that gives rise to the baby itself. \"Mosaic embryos\" containing a mixture of genetically normal and abnormal cells have demonstrated the ability to self-correct and produce a healthy birth. This \"self-correction\" mechanism involves pushing out the genetically abnormal cells into the outer embryo layer, which gives rise to the placenta and umbilical cord. Older women have a limited number of embryos during IVF. Therefore, excluding or discarding mosaic embryos that can potentially give rise to a normal baby, would substantially reduce their chances of IVF success. Some older IVF patients may have no embryos left to transfer after genetic testing. Third, several large-scale clinical studies have shown that PGS does not improve IVF success rates. In 2019, a large multi-centre randomised clinical trial involving 34 IVF clinics in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia and including 661 patients aged between 24 and 40 years, found no significant overall improvement in IVF success rates with PGS. In 2021, another large clinical trial in China, involving 14 IVF clinics and a total of 1,212 patients aged between 20 and 37 years, reported similar unfavourable results that were published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. Hence, based on the latest scientific and clinical data, serious doubts about the medical benefits of PGS have emerged, and current stringent regulation by MOH is thus justified.

Mr Vigneshwaran Gunasegaran, a track access controller, is seen here at a SMRT operations control centre. This audio is AI-generated. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Vigneshwaran Gunasegaran, 39, talks about his transition from an army regular to a career in the rail industry. The Institute of Technical Education graduate, who has spent 10 years with train operator SMRT, works the graveyard shift and oversees track access for engineers and technicians. I started my career as an army regular, serving as an infantry leader and then a trainer at the Specialist Cadet School. After a decade of service, I embarked on a transformative career shift from carrying rifles to holding a portable radio to manage MRT track access with train operator SMRT. During my army days, I had fond memories of the years when I took the first train in the morning from Paya Lebar to Joo Koon station to report for duty at Pasir Laba Camp. I have always been amazed by the punctuality of our trains and the smoothness of the rides captivated me, instilling a deep appreciation for the efficiency of the rail services. It was this admiration that spurred my decision to join the rail industry and contribute to its excellence. March 10, 2024 marked a significant milestone as I celebrated my 10th anniversary at SMRT Trains. I started out as a technical officer in a team overseeing re-signalling work and my duties included testing communications-based train control. In 2018, I switched to a new role to become a ground controller. This involved coordinating track access at a specific interchange station along the North-South East-West Line. Continuing my journey of professional growth, I moved the following year to work in the Operation Control Centre, where I currently serve as a track access controller. In this role, I am tasked with controlling and authorising track access of all stations on the North-South East-West Line and ensuring adherence to safety protocols when SMRT engineers and technicians carry out their daily maintenance on the tracks, which is in the middle of the night when the trains are not running. I monitor track access by using the company’s Track Access Management System which gives me a clear overview of my colleagues on the tracks as well as their movements, so that I can ensure that these abide by safety protocols. Before track access is given at any point, I have to go through various levels of checks with my colleagues in the Operations Control Centre to ensure that traction power is off, safety protection arrangements are in place and engineering trains stabled at worksite. Otherwise, this would mean that my colleagues could be exposed to a risk of electrocution at the trackside and be seriously injured. My highest education qualification is a National ITE Certification in Electronics Engineering (Computer Technology) from the Institute of Technical Education but I hope to be able to pursue a diploma related to rail engineering through a SMRT’s educational advancement programme in the near future. Balancing the demands of night shifts with familial responsibilities has been challenging but fulfilling. Since my job requires me to work from about 9pm to 6am in the morning, I plan my schedule well in order to manage my work and spend time with family and friends. It was initially not easy as my children were young when I first joined SMRT, but with proper time management, I was able to juggle both my work and family responsibilities. I’m lucky that my family and friends see my passion and commitment towards work and support me wholeheartedly. As I work at night, I must constantly be alert and attentive on duty as any delay in my response to any track-related issue could impact the safety and timeliness of our operations. Although my job may be considered a blue-collared one, I find it rewarding because I can see tangible results from my efforts. From safeguarding colleagues on the tracks to ensuring seamless journeys for commuters, each day presents an opportunity to make a meaningful difference. Looking back at my journey in SMRT, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact our work has on the community.

A view during the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Britain, on Aug 8, 2022. This audio is AI-generated. I refer to TODAY’s report on why the 2026 Commonwealth Games is struggling to find a host. With the 2026 games seemingly doomed to be cancelled due to lack of a host, the Commonwealth of Nations may want to consider decentralising future events to several host cities instead. This can significantly reduce the costs of hosting the games, particularly the need to build new facilities which risks being underutilised after the event. Several different cities, or even small nations, can bid for hosting of one or more sports which they have more confidence in managing. It could be a discipline popular in their own country or region, or a case of them having existing infrastructure that are well placed to host the events. Given the global spread of Commonwealth countries, it should not be too difficult to find various hosts that can accommodate a schedule where the weather is conducive for competing. While the economic benefits are less for the individual hosts, so are the costs and risks. With different events conducted simultaneously in different cities, the Games can be completed in a shorter period too than the typical 10 days or more presently. While it means sportsmen and sportswomen from different disciplines may be in separate parts of the world, it may allow greater interaction among the fewer numbers onsite at each host city. Ultimately, this approach provides opportunities for more cities and countries to host events of the Commonwealth Games and encourage participation from those which have never done so. Some dilution of commercial sponsorship can be expected, but this may spur more attention on the sports themselves and enjoyment of simpler but more personal experiences of bringing people together. There is no way for the Commonwealth Games to compete with the Olympics, or specialised sporting events like World Aquatics or the World Cup for football. Perhaps a paradigm shift to focus more on member participation and meaningful camaraderie will help it establish its own niche to remain relevant.

The writer is co-founder of The Resonance Project. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Mr Elijah Chao, 20, describes how he co-founded The Resonance Project at 16 to teach music to underserved children. What began as a musical endeavour evolved into a movement of youths passionate about making a difference. I spent my late teens building a community and leading others to serve. And I wouldn’t trade the experience for any other. My former classmate Ivan Chiew — a guitarist and pianist — and I — a drummer, were just 16 when we started The Resonance Project (Reso), which has brought music to communities across Singapore since January 2021. We hoped to teach music to children who may not have had the same access to music lessons as we did. To my surprise, we weren't alone. Youths around Singapore resonated with our mission and within six weeks, we already had close to 100 student volunteers signed up with us. Working with a team this large was completely new to us. In the following weeks, I began to realise that what we were creating was not just about music. Rather, it represented a wider movement of students who wanted to make a real difference with their time. Scaling up quickly meant that Reso now had to support three weekly music programmes for our beneficiaries. We had to move fast to build some semblance of a curriculum and develop our first team structure. We designed a curriculum in four areas: Keyboard, ukulele, guitar and vocals. Providing free instruments was important to us, so we had to quickly raise funds through T-shirt sales to recoup the hundreds of dollars we had already spent on the first tranche of ukuleles. Uniquely, our programmes did not have an end date. This meant that the kids we served wouldn’t have to worry about us leaving in a few months. Each week, our volunteers would run a 90-minute to 120-minute session, inclusive of a practical lesson, games and time for catching up, on one of the four instrument curriculums we taught. Our pedagogy was simple, less music theory, more enjoying music as an expression, and most importantly, building strong friendships. Despite the hustle, the next few months were largely smooth sailing. I got to know the kids that I was working with much better, and started to realise the true impact we could bring about with our project. Many of the children came from less-than-ideal family situations and it was a privilege to be a “ kor kor ” (older brother) of sorts. Music might have been our medium, but it was my friendship and presence that really made the difference and brightened up their day. To my kids, I became affectionately known as “bird's nest hair”. It was always a joy to be greeted by the stampede of primary schoolers excited to see us. However, growing quickly came with downsides. The level of work and commitment required during the initial setup phase caused several volunteers to leave. We needed to do things differently to keep the team intact. That meant creating a culture of giving that our volunteers believed in, rather than just a “project” that might be phased out anytime. Covid-19 restrictions during the pandemic further accelerated this need. Our programmes had barely begun when we had to cancel sessions. Despite not being able to serve physically, we pivoted towards improving our systems, teams and curriculum instead. A committed group of about 70 — half our members at the time — poured hundreds of hours working online in task forces. They planned out over a year of curriculum, prepared for hybrid sessions and worked on our administrative systems. We also launched “Reso Recharge” sessions — weekly online meetups where team members could study, watch movies or have deep conversations. These sessions provided emotional support to our volunteers during some of the lonelier periods of the semi-lockdown period of the pandemic in 2020. Over time, our volunteers began to see Reso as a circle of trusted friends and something we found worth investing. We resumed sessions in late-2021 and welcomed 127 new members that November. Our team identity also began to form — along with many friendships. Our previous investment into programme planning also paid dividends. Being better equipped, we could focus more on building relationships with our beneficiaries. In 2022, our community grew to more than 300 members. We then had our first opportunity to meet in-person after a year of Zoom meetings. By 2023, many started to describe Reso as a home, a community that they really loved. We also began to reach thousands more across new communities through our events and community concerts. Now, in 2024, Reso’s weekly sessions serve more than 200 children and seniors at more than 18 locations, including social service agencies and senior activity centres. To me, these are not merely numbers — they represent real people and relationships. Three years in, our kids have grown to see us as their kor kors and jie jies (older sisters), while we are like “grandchildren” to our seniors. In short, we get to be like family; ready to listen, support them or even cry with them. Now, at 20, I’m grateful for the trust of my team, and for all the people from whom I've learned. I am grateful that we built a community, knowing that even after I step down, the work, the culture and the spirit of giving will continue. As for me, it will soon be time to explore new ways to bring people together. Through this journey, I’ve learnt that there is value in coming together, investing deeply in people and serving actively. We need many more communities that unite students from different schools in the service of others. ABOUT THE WRITER: Elijah Chao, 20, is the co-founder of The Resonance Project .

The writer is the founder of Don’t Say OK, Kanmani, a ground-up initiative dedicated to South Asian women. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Ms L Priyeswari Devi, 33, recounts how her experience as a South Asian woman in Singapore prompted her to start Don't Say OK, Kanmani as a space for women like her to tackle cultural taboos and dismantle societal expectations. I'm a mum to an adorable one-year-old girl, an educator specialising in community engagement skills, and the founder of a ground-up initiative dedicated to South Asian women in Singapore. My journey with Don't Say OK, Kanmani is deeply influenced by my late mother. She passed down not only knowledge and wisdom, but also cultural norms and rules set aside for South Asian women. For instance, “no entering a temple when you’re menstruating”. These were passed down by her mother, and her mother before that, and they were taught not to question these rules. Inspired by my mother’s struggles, I was determined to shatter this silence. Don't Say OK, Kanmani began in 2020 as a platform for South Asian women to share stories, seek support, and collectively challenge societal norms. The name Don’t Say OK, Kanmani (defined as precious one in Tamil) is a gentle nudge to many women, especially from minority communities, who perhaps tend to say “OK” too easily, accepting whatever is given without asserting themselves. For the past four years, we have highlighted the stories of countless women, each sharing her unique lived experiences. We do this by hosting fireside chats and panel discussions on a range of topics affecting women. These include menstrual health, cultural taboos, and female leadership. We delve into these subjects to understand their profound impact on our daily lives. Being a South Asian woman myself, I recognise that we have internalised certain societal expectations. Dismantling them remains a gradual process, with women and girls encountering unique obstacles, especially in patriarchal societies. For instance, it is challenging to address sensitive topics such as marital expectations, which can often evoke resistance or discomfort due to entrenched cultural norms. I empathised deeply with the barriers these women faced. They were not completely unfamiliar to me, as growing up, I too witnessed this in my own home. I've noticed that although girls and women eagerly sign up with us, they frequently hesitate to voice their opinions. Overcoming these barriers required not only sensitivity, patience, and a commitment to creating a non-judgmental space, but also a profound understanding of the emotional weight these topics carry. One approach we employ involves sharing our own stories and experiences — the emotions and struggles we've endured. By being vulnerable and transparent about our own journeys, we aim to create a sense of understanding within the community and harness the powerful tool of storytelling. I also recognise that participants prefer online sessions when it comes to some topics, giving the option to remain anonymous. We usually hold monthly small-scale sessions of up to 60 participants as these are more manageable for our team to handle. Each month has a different theme. For instance, in February we met with younger girls to talk about the importance of female friendships and finding support. In March, we hosted female business owners to discuss how we could further support one another. The success of Don’t Say OK, Kanmani isn't measured solely by participant numbers or events we’ve had. Rather, it lies in the resonance it generates within the community. For instance, my core team, including Asha Suresh and Nandhini Balakrishnan, whom I had never met before the initiative, joined after discovering our Instagram page, which currently has about 1,900 followers. Many other women have similarly connected with our work and collaborated with us on various projects. Now, the thought of navigating this journey alone feels unimaginable. Another source of joy was our fireside chat last December on female leadership and its societal role. Women expressed a longing for spaces like ours, fostering meaningful dialogue and community engagement. Their positive response affirmed the importance of valuing these leadership approaches and facilitating such crucial conversations. My mother died in 2022, but her response to Don't Say OK, Kanmani remains a profound source of inspiration for me. Before her passing, she conveyed immense pride in the initiative and its influence on the community.

In fact, our recent initiative called Tech Mama, aimed at bridging the digital gap between different generations, is a tribute to her — inspired by her willingness to learn new things — and included some of her acquaintances.

Miss Cassandra Yip-Lee (pictured) is co-founder of Earth School. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Miss Cassandra Yip-Lee, 24, recounts the inspiration behind her initiative, Earth School, the challenges faced in championing environmental education in Singapore and her plans for the future. I’m a passionate environmentalist who runs Earth School — a non-profit organisation that aims to increase environmental literacy among children and youth in Singapore. I started Earth School as a ground-up initiative about three years ago at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic with some of my classmates. We were then all second-year students in the National University of Singapore’s Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme, and we have been sharing our love and knowledge about nature and the environment ever since! I had previously worked at Young Sustainable Impact Southeast Asia, an incubator and accelerator for youth sustainability start-ups. I was inspired by the community there to one day also start something impactful. This opportunity came in 2021, during the Covid lockdowns, when everyone was picking up new hobbies. It made me think about my passions — nature and the environment — and what is missing in the current ecosystem: Education. Hence, Earth School came about. A consensus among my classmates and I is that, growing up in Singapore, we had very limited to no exposure to nature-based or environmental studies. I remember very clearly that my answer to questions such as “what do you want to be when you grow up?” was “marine biologist”, but that never seemed to be a career option. We believe in giving young Singaporeans hope (and proof) that being an environmentalist is indeed a dream that can be realised in our country. Over the past few years, we have worked directly with public schools, charities and grassroots communities to develop environmental education curriculums and pioneer sustainability initiatives. More than 50 students from five primary schools took part in our first programme, Student Heroes in Environmental Leadership Development (Shield), in 2022. Covid-19 regulations were still in place then, so we ran lessons online over Zoom. The 10-week programme covered a different topic each week, such as clean and affordable energy, and sustainable cities and communities. These are based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015 as a roadmap to creating a sustainable, equitable and prosperous world. We aimed to introduce environmental sustainability topics to young students in the context of Singapore and help them understand the challenges that we face and what is being done to mitigate them. A typical lesson would start off with an introduction to the topic, for example: “What is climate change? What is the science behind it? What are its impacts?” This would include diagrams and videos. We even built an online simulation of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve ourselves. We would also present big issues to our students, such as rising sea levels and deforestation. One of the more memorable moments was when an 11-year old asked us: “What happens after the Semakau Landfill becomes full ?” We then realised that young Singaporeans had the intellectual and emotional capacity to think about their future here. However, we no longer run the entire 10-week programme now due to the substantial resources required. Instead, we have taken individual lessons from it and continue to run them with various partners. One of the biggest challenges we face is convincing mainstream schools and educators of the importance of climate science and environmental education, especially for students under the age of 12. A common experience is when a profit-making educator or school approaches us to run a programme for them, and we get very excited about the opportunity to redesign a school wall to show parts of a terrestrial ecosystem, or build solar-powered cars with little girls. However, when we ask what their budget is, it turns out that they were expecting us to run it for free, including covering the expenses for materials. Unfortunately, there is a common misconception that non-profit organisations have zero costs. We learned from these experiences and have now prioritised working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and charities such as Glyph, Budding Minds and HCSA Dayspring to run free or heavily subsidised programmes for them. These include outdoor in-nature lessons and some indoor activities such as microgreen growing. We also have about 10 volunteers who help with nature walks, curriculum development and publicity. We believe that exposure to the natural world can inspire creativity and innovation, as well as instil a sense of belonging and responsibility to care for our country’s green places and wildlife. The best part about the work we do is when we see children get really excited — be it about spotting wildlife in their natural habitat or getting their hands dirty to grow their own microgreens. In 2023, we decided to register Earth School as Earth Academy Limited, a company limited by guarantee . Being a non-profit organisation allows us to make environmental education affordable and accessible to all. We are now working on building Singapore’s first nature classroom, which will be open to the community. My advice to those interested in starting an environmental NGO is to not underestimate how far perseverance will take you. Starting your own thing is incredibly challenging, but it’s a learning process where opportunities can present themselves when you least expect them.

TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Ms Tamara Tan Ann, 24, recounts her journey with 32 Pages, an initiative that aims to provide empathetic spaces for children to learn. What began as a volunteering stint blossomed into a programme that reshaped Miss Tan’s own narrative about her childhood. I was not always drawn to children. There was a time I disliked them and saw them as immature, entitled and unmanageable. This might sound strange coming from a co-founder of 32 Pages — a ground-up initiative started in 2021 that helps children build motivation and resilience in learning. My change of heart was a surprise to me, too. It all began with serving children in the community. As a psychology undergraduate in 2021 who was yearning for hands-on experience in the field, I sought internships that would equip me with the tools to provide therapeutic support to children and adolescents in the future. After learning ways to manage children’s behaviour and nurture their socio-emotional development, I was eager to apply these skills in a relevant setting. Fast-forward to 2024 — Chloe Ng, Cheryl Lee and I have been running 32 Pages for nearly three years. What began as a volunteering stint to serve communities living in rental flats and to hone my skills soon morphed into a profound journey that reshaped not only my perception of children, but also the course of my career. Our initial programme, Little Readers: Big Dreams, focused mainly on English literacy for children aged four to 10. It was met with tantrums, inattention and other classroom avoidant behaviours that tested our teaching prowess. This pushed us to confront a pressing need we saw within children in these communities — emotional resilience. Recognising this gap, we modified the programme to integrate socio-emotional growth as well, to develop motivation and resilience in learning among children. While our curriculum incorporates diverse tools — ranging from storybooks and worksheets to crafts and games — the crux of our approach centres on adult modelling. We see ourselves as our children’s role models, leading by example to show them how to navigate the world with empathy and resilience. In essence, we as adults shape their journey through our own actions and examples. Today, 32 Pages has served more than 100 children across three neighbourhoods — Redhill, Henderson and Bukit Panjang — with the help of a supportive voluntary community of more than a dozen members who feel as strongly about our children’s potential. We have also received support from partners such as South Central Community Family Service Centre, Leng Kee Community Club, and We Love Learning Centre, among others. The most impactful story for me comes from my interaction with a five-year-old boy who quickly became the nightmare of every volunteer during our time at Bukit Merah. He was the “naughty kid”, “problematic child” and “hyperactive boy”. It was difficult to work with him; he was disobeying instructions by refusing to sit properly and not taking part in our activities. It was after working with him for quite some time that I realised the problem. We were not listening to him. I should have known this; I was once a child who felt like her opinions were sidelined and actions were misinterpreted as defiance. Rather than reprimanding him for his outbursts, I made it a point to sit with him and hear his side of the story. Over time, as I listened, he reciprocated in engagement and participation, and even began to enjoy our shared reading sessions. My experience at 32 Pages has taught me that children fall behind not for a lack of resources, but because they associate learning spaces with negative experiences and feelings. The places we inhabit and the people we meet influence the stories we tell ourselves — about who we are and the people we can become. That is why we also train our volunteers to build meaningful relationships and hone emotional literacy — to allow children to feel heard in their struggles. Other times, the struggles we faced were more practical. Our programme relies heavily on the dedication of our volunteers, who enable us to provide one-to-one support for our children. Yet, sustaining this weekly commitment over a 10-week period, alongside full-time studies or jobs, is no easy task. What keeps us going is the improvement we see in children, such as witnessing them take deep breaths to soothe tantrums and having them share their lives, worries and aspirations with us. For children, suppressing these feelings translates into “challenging behaviour”. Instead of recoiling at such outbursts, I have found it empowering to treat these moments as opportunities for understanding what might be holding them back from learning. We believe our work also helps build up a generation of adults who can provide an empathetic space for children to grow. It not only encourages us to withhold personal judgement and model empathy towards children, but also towards ourselves. Over time, I’ve come to realise: I didn’t like children. It was because I felt disliked as a child. This was a personal narrative that fuelled my desire to support others who shared similar experiences. However, even though personal stories inspire us to foster change, it’s the stories born from that change that will keep us going. As changemakers, instead of dwelling on our personal past, we should focus on future narratives — new narratives that unfold within the lives of those we serve, the volunteers who join us in our mission, and even deep within ourselves.

It resulted in a “foot drop”, a condition where it was extremely difficult to lift my foot. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Ms Sherry Soon, 42, recounts her struggle with vasculitis, a debilitating autoimmune disease. Starting an online community, Autoimmune Diseases Singapore, helped her find support and a sense of belonging among others with similar conditions. In 2000, my life took a sharp turn when I woke up one morning with a debilitating pain shooting down my left leg. It resulted in a “foot drop”, a condition where it was extremely difficult to lift my foot. After 10 days of tests in hospital, I received a life-altering diagnosis: Vasculitis, a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the blood vessels. I was just 19 then and had a hard time accepting that my disease was incurable and that I would have to be on lifelong medications. The constant intake of several medications came with a host of side effects including heart palpitations, nausea, hair loss, weight gain and digestive issues — all of which made life a struggle. The tougher episodes had to do with the flares. My immune system, attacking my blood vessels, caused excruciating pain and horrific open ulcers on my legs. These flares worsened over time, with the strongest painkillers offering little relief. Simple daily activities such as standing and walking became potential triggers, a constant source of frustration as I watched my peers effortlessly navigate life. I wished that I could be a normal student. The year I got diagnosed, I was studying engineering at Nanyang Technological University, but was coping badly due to the demands of the course. My condition made things worse. I did not graduate and switched to a bachelor of business (business administration) degree course at the Australia-based RMIT University in 2003, graduating only in 2006. Living with vasculitis means constant uncertainty. Medications like steroids, crucial for managing the disease, come with their own set of problems. During a 2014 trip to Kyoto my scarf snagged on a cyclist’s wheel and that resulted in a devastating fall and subsequent hip fracture due to steroid-induced bone weakening. I had to undergo months of rehabilitation after an emergency surgery in Japan. Additionally, the invisibility of the disease presents its own disadvantages. While I may appear healthy, excessive standing can worsen my condition. This forces me to get a priority seat for people in need on the MRT train, but the fear of judgement for using a reserved seat adds to the stress of daily commute. Not knowing anyone else with vasculitis, or other autoimmune diseases, was isolating. It was hard to find anyone else who could understand what I was going through. Determined to connect with others facing similar situations, I organised a Singapore-based contact group in 2013. My first meeting was with two fellow patients, face to face, and it was a turning point: There was finally a space for open conversation and shared experiences. As our numbers grew, we started a closed Facebook group called Autoimmune Diseases Singapore in 2015. It had about 40 members at the time, consisting of a diverse group of working adults with specific rheumatological and neurological autoimmune diseases. When I first started the group, I was working as a learning specialist at a non-profit organisation. Balancing full-time work with organising group activities proved difficult. Nicole Chan, who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, joined us in 2018 as our community engagement manager. She quickly became a pillar of support, co-organising our activities. Today, we have more than 300 members. We meet once every two or three months, both in-person and online. Members are also encouraged to post their questions and communicate with other members online at any time. We also feature patients' stories on our website, and organise activities like watercolour painting workshops, kite-flying and “makan” (meal) sessions. During the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we packed care packages filled with handwritten “Thank you” messages and created a video expressing our gratitude towards healthcare workers. With help from the Singapore Kindness Movement and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, we designed a self-care journal that was distributed to more than 10,000 healthcare workers. These journals featured drawings from members of the public to encourage these workers. Looking forward, our long-term goal is to advocate for greater awareness of autoimmune diseases, even if they are less prevalent in Singapore. We hope to contribute to healthcare policies that consider the specific needs of those living with these conditions. The journey has not been without obstacles. Juggling my own health with running the group can be demanding, and members' health struggles can limit their ability to contribute consistently. A particularly hard thing to hear arose when a member talked about her refusal to adhere to her medications, leading to painful flares. Having experienced flares myself, it was heartbreaking to hear of her suffering. Despite the difficulties, the rewards have been immense. Seeing members form friendships and find solace in shared experiences is incredibly fulfilling. Recently, we held our first public event at The Red Box in Somerset, where we had members speak out about their feelings of loneliness in their physical struggles and how that changed when they joined our group. Their realisation, that the group provides a sense of belonging and connection, is truly our greatest success. We let patients know they are not alone on their journey with their autoimmune disease. We believe that it is easy to be kind. My advice to anyone considering a similar group is simple: Start now. Don't wait for everything to be perfect. ABOUT THE WRITER: Sherry Soon, 42, is the executive director of the charity organisation Be Kind SG, and the founder of Autoimmune Diseases Singapore. She is also a member of the Ministry of Health’s Agency for Care Effectiveness' consumer panel and SingHealth’s Patient Advocacy Network.

Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Mr Mason Ong, 20, recounts how a quest to borrow a pencil sparked the birth of Project WIN, a youth-led initiative which aims to address community needs through volunteerism. Despite challenges such as funding and scepticism, the project has successfully engaged more than 200 volunteers over the past four years. I have volunteered since I was in Secondary 1, as I was drawn to the potential of volunteering to change lives. I would find various ways to help the community, for example by delivering food to elderly residents. My journey with Project WIN, or “What I Need”, started in 2020 — right before my N-Levels — with a forgotten pencil case. I needed to borrow a pen or pencil to survive the day in school. It was then that I noticed some of my friends had only either one pencil or pen, and they could not lend me any. I later found out that was all they could afford, and it got me thinking: What can I do to contribute? What can the community do to chip in? That was the moment Project WIN was born. Our mission is simple yet aspirational: We strive to meet the needs of individuals in our community, and also foster a sense of belonging and connection among them. We do this by collaborating with various charities and organisations to find opportunities for our pool of youth volunteers to serve the community. We offer three broad services — volunteer requests, befriending and event organising. Our volunteer request service allows our partners to reach out to us to help at their events. One of them is Nee Soon Central Zone 3 Residents’ Network. They regularly request volunteers from us to support their initiatives, such as senior nights and festival celebrations. We also work with specific organisations to provide befrienders from our team. These befrienders are tasked to go through a crisis with a resident, which could be a medical crisis or loss of a family member. When a referrer comes to us, we try to recommend a befriender that best suits them. Last, we coordinate with partners such as senior activity centres and residents’ networks to organise a range of community activities. A particularly memorable one was a campfire and carnival for a special needs school in 2022. We were just emerging from Covid-19 and a friend told me about the school wanting to hold an event to celebrate coming back together. Even though it rained that night, we still managed to pull off the event. The smiles and joy that night is a memory that I will never forget. The trust and resources allocated to us grew with each successful engagement, and soon, we explored creating bigger events, such as the Nee Soon Central Youth Prom Night in 2023. To help youths connect with each other after almost three years in isolation, we brought together 100 participants from the Nee Soon Central Community Club (CC) to experience “prom night”. I saw many new friendships formed that night among the young who may not have met each other before in a normal setting, which I hope will continue to foster good neighbourly relationships. Our journey is not without challenges. Many times, we've been told to give up because “many people are already doing this kind of work”. We also often run into difficulties in funding our activities. There were questions about the credibility of a ground-up, making it tough to obtain the resources we needed. To overcome these obstacles, I ensure that my team has the specific competencies in completing an event. When we lack expertise, we seek help from experienced community leaders or organisations. When it comes to funding, we have been fortunate to partner with organisations such as Nee Soon Central CC. We earned the trust of its management committee and were appointed as one of its community volunteer groups in 2022. We ensure that our proposals present valid community needs and creative solutions to meet these needs. Funds are usually approved if these requirements are met. We are also proud to have worked with other organisations including the People's Association, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Ramakrishna Mission. As a ground-up consisting of a core team of 10 youths, an additional goal for us is to increase the youth volunteerism rate by initiating ad-hoc programmes in collaboration with community centres. Over the span of four years, we have engaged more than 200 volunteers and created more than 40 volunteer activities, including those mentioned above and others such as supporting the elderly during various festivities. Despite the challenges, the joy and fulfilment we've experienced through our initiatives has been immeasurable and we refuse to let these constraints hold us back. There's something special about bringing people together and creating meaningful connections. To anyone out there interested in starting their own ground-up, my advice is simple: Listen to advice from others, but don't let negative comments discourage you. Not everyone will understand your vision, but that's okay. Stay true to yourself and your mission. The landscape of community work is ever evolving, so be willing to pivot and adapt as needed. Build connections with everyone you meet. You never know who might be able to offer support or guidance along the way.

Mr Adrian Phoon (far left) and some members of The Morning Greeters greeting a runner while running at Woodlands Waterfront Park on June 9, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Mr Adrian Phoon, 36, recounts the ups and downs of his journey with The Morning Greeters, an initiative he started 11 years ago to promote kindness through the simple act of greeting strangers during a morning run. I founded The Morning Greeters with three other friends back in 2013 when I was a final-year undergraduate at the Singapore Institute of Technology. Our first “greet-and-run” session was on Jan 1, 2013 at Bishan Park. We publicised the event on Facebook and about 15 to 20 runners turned up. The idea for the group came after one of my runs. It was when I realised that despite living in Bishan for the past two decades, it felt like everyone I ran past on my usual route was a stranger. I had recently returned from a backpacking trip to Europe and felt that Singapore, despite its small size, ironically lacked that close-knit community spirit I experienced in much larger countries. So, the next time I ran, I decided to greet every single person I passed on the trails at MacRitchie Reservoir. I was pleasantly surprised at how effortless it was, and it was heartening to see smiles on the faces of those I encountered. That's when I knew I had to do something, and The Morning Greeters was born. The Morning Greeters started off gathering runners from all walks of life for weekend runs. Now, a decade later, we are still going strong. Our hope is that, through these sessions, participants will “pass the baton” and cultivate a habit of greeting others in their own neighbourhoods. We meet at a different venue each week. The sessions usually start from an MRT station and from there, the group runs to a nearby park or park connector. We run for about 3km to 4km each session. Speed is not of the essence because we want each participant to be able to experience the good vibes of greeting others. One of the best decisions we made throughout this time was our commitment to consistency, regardless of external factors. Our members made a solemn vow to be there, rain or shine. In the early days, this commitment was tested. There were instances when the turnout was sparse, with just me alone or accompanied by one or two others. Some participants told us that the timing of our meets, usually 7.15am, was too early. We also held sessions on Sunday mornings, which deterred younger runners from joining us since they preferred to sleep in on the weekend. From time to time, we would hear negative responses to our greetings, such as,“What's so good in the morning?!\" Thankfully, it wasn't that often. It was these responses that kept us going and wanting to do more. We felt that our society needed us to remind them to be kind. It would have been easy to be discouraged, but we held on to our belief in the power of our mission. Whether we greeted one person or a dozen, I believe the impact of our actions transcended numbers. Since the beginning, I have envisioned ourselves being in a community where people are nice and friendly to one another. If anyone were to meet a mishap on the streets, my hope is that there is always someone looking out for them. We were fortunate to be noticed by a reporter from The Straits Times, who published an article in 2013 that attracted more people whose values aligned with ours. We also caught the notice of the Singapore Kindness Movement, and were officially inducted as a ground-up movement that year, which helped amplify our message. What started with just a few individuals grew to almost 35 regulars on a weekly basis. Gathering people to believe in the same cause is not easy, but we believed and reached out to one person at a time, and this created a ripple effect that we hope evolves into a tidal wave. One of our biggest hopes is to have more young members or students join us so that we can have fresh ideas and energy to do new initiatives. Another pursuit we were thinking of embarking on was to gather ex-runners or even ex-competitive runners to join us. Having spent 11 years with The Morning Greeters, my commitments naturally have evolved with time. From starting the movement as a student to now being married with two kids and running my own design firm, the journey has been transformative. One of the best takeaways from this movement is the wonderful friends I’ve made, in the community of runners and in the people who believed in our movement. To anyone with an idea for a similar movement, my advice is simple: Take action. You never know where it will lead, and even if it doesn't work out as planned, you'll know you gave it your best shot. ABOUT THE WRITER: Adrian Phoon, 36, runs his own design firm, The Floorplan Collective. He enjoys building new things and exploring creative pursuits, though his first love is the outdoors and running. The Morning Greeters is a ground-up movement supported by the Singapore Kindness Movement’s Kindred Grant, which provides seed funding for various kindness initiatives in Singapore.

Responses among readers covered a broad range of viewpoints. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore's need for foreign manpower and talent sparked debate this week, after TODAY's Big Read explored the tensions surrounding the topic amid an ageing population and record-low fertility rates. Responses among TODAY readers covered a broad range of viewpoints, with some asking why Singapore needs this much foreign talent and workers, while others support immigration but say that there is a need to better integrate foreigners and also address the country’s low fertility rate. Here's a selection of comments: Why are there so many retrenchments happening if there is a shortage of talent? For_Entertain_Only Why do we keep depending on foreign talent? Hasn’t Singapore been building (local) talent already? Our education is considered on top of the world, we have local talent with international exposure. So, what's wrong here? Maybe the country isn't growing real talent, but used the wrong approach in talent gauging by numbers only for decades. geckosg Getting more foreign workers to “solve” the economy is just throwing money at a problem that isn’t solved by money. Foreign talents will come in, do good work, and our economy will bump up a little bit. Then they’ll take their savings and go back to their country to live a luxurious life, and our economy will crash worse than it did before. Nivlacart Why are those who were educated here and went through the system not able to get jobs that employers are looking to fill? If the education system is fit for purpose in the first place, we won't have to constantly lament the lack of talents and resort to massive importation. TP LEE Singapore indeed cannot thrive without immigration, but is it thriving under the past and current immigration policies? Immigration when implemented well is a net positive thing. All the major financial and tech hubs in the world are highly cosmopolitan because talents are a global scarcity. Has Singapore become anywhere near the likes of San Francisco, London, and Hong Kong after two decades of massive immigration? Maybe we are not getting much real talent after all. wtf_m1 We need real foreign talent who can teach us things to help us get self-sufficient, but we don’t need cheap and fake talent from degree mills or fake degrees to compete with us Singaporeans. SAMSONITE SAM Fighting over cushy office and specialised jobs for locals is good and all, but why then are the hard caps being applied to the lowest-end jobs? … I don't see Singaporeans lining up to fill jobs like waiters, cleaners and factory line workers. ASTIA HG The policy needs constant review by people from different backgrounds with an unbiased approach to at least ensure policies and practices are not overdone to the detriment of local-born PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians). HUDDER TOOFS Singapore isn't alone, practically all other developed nations are facing a TFR (total fertility rate) crisis. It almost seems like the trend is towards countries fighting for an increasingly limited pool of skilled workers globally. I think we really need to ensure that Singaporeans are able to compete on the global stage, and not just in the local job market. But of course there's going to be so much opposition to reforming our approach towards education because it’s much easier to stick with what we have now (mugging + regurgitating during exams). whydoweneedusers We really shouldn't accept this framing unless there is an equal policy effort in promoting family-friendly policies and reversing the TFR trend. If not we might as well start questioning — what exactly is Singapore? A country? Or just an economy that needs to expand forever despite a dwindling number of people who are born here? FalseAgent There are two distinct and separate issues when talking about foreigners. One, if they integrate and assimilate smoothly into Singapore society and adopt our ways, I see no problem. But, two, if they come here to work but their loyalty isn't with Singapore but elsewhere, and they bring their own kaki to replace or displace Singaporean workers, now that is a huge problem. Another problem is the ultra-rich foreigners who come here buying up everything and thereby pushing up the prices (cost of living). LARRY WHOSOEVER TFR won’t be solved if the cost of living is high and WFH (work-from-home) is non-existent as a policy. Sending kids to childcare is expensive; grandparents need to be taken care of too. Only_Run7280 Let’s be practical, logical, and rational. We as Singaporeans are not reproducing ourselves fast enough — ageing population, high divorce rate, low marriage rate. If we keep complaining online and only remain keyboard warriors, soon we will not exist to even complain. Let’s post constructive criticism, take more ownership and think rationally in improving our country as citizens than being purely emotional.

From left: Heart.th's founders Samuel Law, Jasmine Lum, Raymus Koh and Nicole Soh holding their activity booklets at the Singapore Kindness Movement's Kindness Day SG at Paya Lebar Quarter mall on May 20, 2023. This audio is AI-generated. Singapore has about 450 active ground-up initiatives, made up of groups of individuals who come together in self-organised projects to help the community. TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Ms Jasmine Lum, 27, recounts her year-long journey with Heart.th, an initiative that aims to help young people better engage their families through meaningful conversations at home. Heart.th is a ground-up initiative that aims to strengthen parent-child relationships by sparking conversations at home. It began as an idea from my days as a history undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University. I stayed in a campus hostel and spent time with my parents only on weekends. During meals, our conversations were often limited to the usual exchanges of “Have you eaten?” and “How’s your day?”. I was deeply dissatisfied with these trivial conversations and longed to build deeper connections with my parents. After some trial and error, I found that fun facts I learnt from my history modules were good conversation starters. It was especially true for topics about Singapore’s early years — during my parents’ childhood. In 2021, I attended Focus on the Family’s 1825 programme for young people aged 18 to 25, where I met others who were passionate about creating stronger families. They came from varying family backgrounds, but all had the common hope of seeing strong and united families thriving in Singapore. Listening to their family experiences, I began reflecting on the important role that good communication plays — mainly in overcoming family conflicts and building strong relationships. As part of the 1825 initiative, we were challenged to come up with a project for families. I started to develop a plan for Heart.th, which would combine my interest in history with my new-found belief in quality communication. I shared my idea with some friends I met through volunteering at Focus on the Family. Their names are Samuel, Nicole, Jakin and Raymus, and they all also believed in the importance of quality family conversations. We believe that every meaningful conversation between parent and child is likened to building a bridge that connects them, which can withstand challenges and conflicts that may arise. The biggest contrast in familial relationships could be seen between my co-lead Samuel and I. Unlike me, he had the most engaging and intriguing conversations with his parents over meals — indeed, eating together with them was one of his greatest joys. Their conversations made him realise how alike he was to them and how connected their stories were. He also found that through conversation, he could adopt the resilience shown by his parents to grow to be a stronger individual. Drawing from our stories, we started Heart.th with the idea of creating booklets filled with conversation starters. The idea came into fruition in early 2023, when we curated online activity books from scratch for students aged 11 to 15 that aimed to help them start conversations with their parents. There were three activity books with different topics for families to choose from — namely food, phones and classroom. We also included some fun Singapore history, and various activities and discussion questions for families to take part together. My team added a personal touch to the books by including our own family's stories. As we were looking for partners to support us in printing physical booklets, Samuel received a call from the Singapore Kindness Movement, wondering if he was doing any other projects. With the opportunity presented by Singapore Kindness Movement's grant, I launched Heart.th as a ground-up movement in May 2023 with my four friends. We later got the funding we needed to distribute more than 400 copies of our booklets to youth, parents, grandparents, educators and churches. This year, we started monthly gatherings where about 10 young people passionate about family were equipped with tools to facilitate family conversations. It was birthed from a need to go beyond the booklets and have physical gatherings to engage with the youth on a deeper level. Each month covered a different topic on communication in families, and the young were encouraged to share their own family experiences and hopes for families in Singapore. The founding team members took turns to facilitate these sessions, and the sessions were organised such that older youth volunteers aged 21 and above would help mentor and journey with the younger ones. The usual turnout for these sessions would be around 10 people. Though that may seem too few, I believe that the stories that have been shared are not small in any way. Some of the youth needed a safe space to talk about their families, and it has been a privilege to provide a space for them to share their thoughts authentically. A common challenge faced by any ground-up movement would be balancing between being realistic and going “crazy” for our dreams. It has been a delicate art — juggling work and not neglecting my own family time and being involved in our activities. I’m still learning to be more disciplined in my time management by planning things in advance and communicating my need for support to loved ones. Heart.th has been active for a year and I have found it an exceedingly fruitful experience so far. I believe that even if your own family experience has not been ideal, you can be a builder of strong, thriving families with one open conversation at a time.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks I am one of the many young adults who started tertiary education in 2020 during the pandemic — a Covid-19 student, in other words. Chua Jun Hong, 18, is a third-year Ngee Ann Polytechnic student studying information technology, and is also an OCBC Ignite intern. I am one of the many young adults who started tertiary education in 2020 during the pandemic — a Covid-19 student, in other words. As a result, most of my first two years studying information technology at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) was a solitary experience. Projects and presentations were all done virtually, while we attended lessons from the comfort and safety of home. It was only in my final year, after my internship began, did I discover what I was missing from my polytechnic experience. For most, tertiary education is the bridge between childhood and adulthood, learning what it takes to become a financially independent individual entering the working world for the first time. But with everyone studying or working in silos from home due to the pandemic and lacking the rich physical interactions that a polytechnic environment can bring, I did not realise that I gave little thought to what life could have in store for me in the working world. That was until I joined a year-long internship with OCBC Bank in 2022, which is considered to be quite a lengthy programme. Known as Ignite, it is a new scheme meant for third-year polytechnic students in the information technology field. The selling point for this internship is that it is specially tailored to every student’s interest, be it data analytics or mobile app development. Having honed a keen interest in mobile app development for a while, my interest was piqued when I first found out about the internship. But then, I had lingering doubts about registering for this programme. When I mention to others that this is a year-long internship, I usually get looks of astonishment and disbelief. Most internships in polytechnics are typically four to six months long. I also had reservations about spending my last poly year in an internship, after already having spent the last two years studying from home. I wanted to, at the very least, experience the “normal” poly life by studying and hanging out with friends on campus before my graduation. And while my peers are on their semester breaks, going out and having fun, I would still be at work. Nevertheless, after giving it much thought, I decided that an internship would be good for my career, especially in today’s competitive environment. In a time and age when working adults are heading back to schools as part of Singapore’s lifelong learning push, I thought the other way round — with students building their careers early in actual workplaces — was also important. I felt that a year-long experience in the corporate world would greatly benefit me as I could put into practice the skills I learnt in school. With only 20 spots available for the Ignite programme’s pioneer batch of interns, securing a spot was rather competitive and all interested students had to demonstrate coding abilities and project management skills through a hackathon organised by NP. Thankfully, my team and I managed to do well in the hackathon with the help of my lecturer, Dr Joel. We developed a website and mobile solution that shortened the time needed to create a joint banking account. It is now my 10th month into the internship. As part of the mobile development team in OCBC’s group operations and technology division, I get to work on introducing new features to the bank’s business banking mobile apps, develop skills learnt in school, understand industry standards and get the latest updates on enterprise technology. I was able to apply the things I learnt from my polytechnic modules like the mobile application development and solutions design and development classes I attended in my first and second years in NP. These skills I learnt from school helped me to understand technical concepts and the process behind designing an IT solution. Several months into my internship, I was given a task to revamp one of the features in the OCBC business banking mobile application, and I worked with my colleagues to create a better user experience for customers using the application. One thing I have learnt, coming from the perspective of a “Covid-19 student”, is the mantra that work happens in person. My colleagues and I have the option to work from home, but on most days, I choose to commute from my home in Jurong to OCBC’s offices in Tampines every weekday, despite the long commuting hours. There are so many benefits: from being able to discuss difficult coding tasks in person, to the celebrations shared when my colleagues and I solve a bug on an app. Despite being a “mere intern”, I felt a sense of pride that I have participated in something bigger than myself by helping to improve something that actual customers use. It is not something that I would have experienced had I just stayed in school, and is certainly an experience I can take with me and speak about in future job interviews. In any case, it feels as though I have already embarked on my first “real” job, since I no longer need to return to school for classes once I complete this internship. The past ten months have been invaluable to my personal growth into adulthood, all thanks to the guidance of my colleagues at the bank and my academic supervisor at NP, Mr Andy. It is their spirit that drives me forward, and I will cherish these experiences when I begin my actual career elsewhere.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks For six years, I found myself straddling various responsibilities. As a teenager then, I worked full-time as a customer service officer in the aviation sector while pursuing my bachelor’s degree in marketing and international business at Murdoch University. For six years, I found myself straddling various responsibilities. As a teenager then, I worked full-time as a customer service officer in the aviation sector while pursuing my bachelor’s degree in marketing and international business at Murdoch University. During my final year of my three-year-long bachelor's degree, my grandfather fell seriously ill. He was over 80 years old and very weak and needed all the help he could get. Between my siblings and me, we rotated nightly shifts to look after him so as to ensure he received all the care he needed. This happened on each night that my dad was working overseas while my mom had to take care of all aspects of our own household, on top of her own health. I remember burning the midnight oil to work on my school assignments while caring for my grandpa at home. Those days felt long. I felt worn out at the end of an eight to 12-hour workday, while doing my best to juggle deadlines of my assignments and exams, which were stressful at most times. As a teenager who also has social needs, I struggled to give up plans with friends to look after my family or prioritise assignments over family time. I recall feeling very overwhelmed, stressed and fatigued at that time. I struggled for a while with the burden of all this responsibility placed on me. I often fell asleep during lessons, could not concentrate properly at work and had frequent migraines too. There were days I felt like giving up on my academics. So what if I didn’t do well in school? But I never did throw in the towel. What kept me going was my goal of working in a global company, and that my education, work experience and determination would eventually help me get there. This was an aspiration that I had since I was little — that there was a bigger world for me to participate in. Being part of a multinational corporation also showed me that there are equal opportunities for every individual to make an impact, regardless of their background. I also aspired to be in a position where I could learn about different perspectives from around the world thanks to my diverse teams of colleagues. Upon my graduation, I was still undecided about the field that I wanted to pursue, but I knew I wanted two things: To gain hands-on experience, and to do something that has a positive impact on society. One day, I came across a commercial for Skills Ignition SG — an upskilling programme by Infocomm Media Development Authority and Google. The ad showed a delivery worker, who had little to no digital-related work experience, benefitting from a programme that is meant to give Singaporeans a head start in such jobs. The idea of becoming a trainee at a major tech company excited me, but with a GCE Normal (Academic) background, I didn't think I stood a chance as it seemed that only top students or those who went to a top university would be considered. I hesitated in applying as I didn't think I would qualify and didn't meet all of the prerequisites. But my fiance insisted that I should try even if I didn't get in. After all, my family situation had already eased up by then. I had more time on my hands to commit to my goal of landing a job in the tech industry by focusing on picking up new skills. So, I decided to reach out to the trainee featured in the ad on LinkedIn to learn about her story. Thanks to her positive feedback and my fiance's support, I applied for the programme. Within a few weeks, I received an email stating that I was shortlisted for an interview. I just remembered screaming in excitement, \"My application went through!\" Each time I passed an interview round, it felt like a huge relief. When I finally received the email from Google saying I was accepted, it was the most incredible feeling. I was jumping with joy and could not wait to get started on this new path. During the three months of vocational training, I learned about the different digital marketing frameworks and how to create marketing proposals. Developing websites, and products and marketing them to specific markets were additional skills I picked up during the training. In addition to marketing and communication, entrepreneurial activity had a great deal of impact, as my long-term goal was to start my own business one day. When I started my six months of on-the-job training at Google, it felt like I was about to start a new chapter of my life. I was so nervous and couldn't find the courage to make conversations and connect with other people. But the open environment encouraged me to meet new people over coffee chats, learn more about their team culture, and get acquainted with my new role. This was a far cry from my six years juggling various responsibilities, when I had to sacrifice my social time due to another competing need. Looking back, I am grateful to myself and my family for riding through that challenging period together, and that ordeal only inspired me further to pursue my dreams of working in a global company. Five months into the internship programme, I saw an available opening within the tech customer experience team at Google. I took it, and even though I thought I lacked the technical skills for the job, my prior customer service experience and ongoing traineeship journey helped to secure that spot. It's been two months into my new role now. I'm learning something new and exciting every day and having the chance to express my thoughts without fear of rejection or judgement made me feel good about myself. I started to embrace change and improve for the better. And this was all because of that perseverance, and that leap of faith to step outside my comfort zone and do things that are uncomfortable but necessary for my own well-being. Five years on, I am no longer the stressed and easily overwhelmed person that I was in my teens. With so much placed on my shoulders then, I realised I lacked the breathing room to discover myself and my own abilities. The job experience and shadowing sessions helped me perform better in creativity, communication, and teamwork in my full-time role. Most importantly, I discovered the importance of believing in myself, and there is a bright future awaiting those who dare to break out of their mould.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks After my N-Level examinations, I was uncertain whether I could find a job. The author graduated from the YMCA-Inclus Train and Place Series, a vocational programme launched in 2022 to train youth with special needs. After my N-Level examinations, I was uncertain whether I could find a job. I had pursued a course in nutrition and food science and always dreamed of joining the food and beverage industry upon my graduation. But for a long time, I had many questions about my future and what I could do when I entered the working world. Will any organisation hire someone on the autism spectrum like myself? Does my handicap exclude me from the workforce? Is there a place in this world for someone like me? When I was around 18 to 19 years old, I attended some training courses to prepare myself for the F&B industry, but was not able to find suitable job placements. My mum, who is always very supportive of me and my aspirations, helped to look around for suitable training courses that I could learn from and increase my chances of employability. It was a blessing that my mum got to know about the YMCA-Inclus Train and Place Series, a new vocational programme launched this year funded by the Citi Foundation. Taking place over several weeks, the programme equips youth with special needs, like myself, with vocational skills related to the F&B and hospitality industries. Additionally, we are provided with enrichment activities aimed at improving our physical, mental and emotional well-being. Upon completion, the programme supports us through guided interviews and access to a network of partners, to enhance our opportunities for long-term employment. I recall my mum telling me about this programme at a time when I felt lost and uncertain, with a tendency to refuse new experiences. But her belief in me and her conviction that this programme was a real opportunity made me really interested and I wanted to give it a shot. Yet, not everything went as smoothly as I hoped it would. It is a fact that most people with autism have problems with motor skills, which can range from bad handwriting to difficulties with walking. In the initial stages of the programme, I struggled with activities that focused on fine motor skills, problem solving, stress management and teamwork. More often than not, I got frustrated that I was not able to complete the tasks given. Another challenge I faced was learning new things and picking up new skills in general. I usually get very anxious when faced with a new task before me. Instead of calling it quits, I decided to persevere and try my best to overcome these challenging moments during the programme. The daily encouragement of my parents kept me going. I am also grateful that the trainers at YMCA are really nice and patient to me, helping me ease into the programme. Over time, my confidence grew with their support. Throughout the course of the programme, I also got to pick up new skills in the F&B industry, such as attending to customers, food hygiene and cutlery cleaning. Another exciting part of the programme is that I got to participate in arts and sports enrichment sessions to improve my well-being. I participated in dance sessions every Friday, where I really enjoyed the high energy music. I never knew that dancing could be so much fun! After many weeks of learning and fun moments, I was so elated when graduation day finally came. I was part of the first batch of youth who graduated from the programme on April 14 last year. With support from the trainers and my family, I was able to find stable employment in an F&B-related job at a local hotel. During the programme, I went through role-playing sessions and job interviews to prepare me to enter the working world. The interviews were guided, which meant that staff members from Inclus sat in during my arranged job interviews with potential employers. Inclus is a social enterprise that empowers persons with special needs through gainful employment and independence. They guided me on how to better express myself and also explained what the contract terms meant so that I could better understand the job I was applying for. Without them, it would be an uphill task as I do not think I can easily pass a job interview on my own. At my new job, my main tasks include polishing cutlery, setting up and cleaning the seating area. I really enjoy my work! I met managers and colleagues who are really patient with me, as I settle into my new routines and tasks. Aside from putting the hard skills I learnt into work, I also learnt how to better communicate with my colleagues. When I need some advice on how to perform better at work, I am thankful that I can still approach my job coach from Inclus. Over the past few months of working, I learnt that F&B services in general can be very dynamic, and there are a lot of changes to adapt to. One thing I am still working on is to be more flexible and be able to adapt to changes in my work schedule, as well as being more attentive and careful. Looking back, I think what made a difference was the fact that there are many opportunities for persons with special needs to learn and grow. In the past, I would usually say no to new things. But now, I will at least try, and I encourage others to do the same. There is a place for people with special needs in our society, it just takes some work to get there. I can see that my parents were happy for me when I secured a job, and I am so blessed and thankful for their love and support for me for the past 19 years. Now, I want to become more independent, so that I can take better care of myself and give my parents more assurance for my future.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Back in 2015, my worst fears as a 12-year-old kid were realised when I didn’t do as well as I wanted to for my Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Former TODAY intern reporter Lou Si Yuan poses for a photo, for Gen Z Speaks, on Jan 25, 2023. Back in 2015, my worst fears as a 12-year-old kid were realised when I didn’t do as well as I wanted to for my Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). I thought about this recently when I watched a viral TikTok clip of a mum influencer who posted about her daughter in tears upon receiving her O-Level results. While most netizens’ attention was on the mother’s decision to share such a private moment in public, my thoughts were on the reactions of her daughter. I recall being in her shoes nine years ago. Staring at the number on my results slip, I burst out crying in the school hall because I scored 20 points lower than I had hoped. But PSLE was over, and there was nothing I could do to change my grades. The only thing I could do was to spend the next week carefully considering what school to go to. Every school I had hoped to attend was now out of my score range, so my parents and I had to hastily assemble a list of schools that I could qualify for in my area. It was then that I remember hearing the phrase “every school is a good school” for the first time. It sounded like a consolation for my poorer-than-expected results — my parents said it as they discussed the pros and cons of each school almost as if they were trying to justify my school choice to themselves. But my disappointment was immeasurable. For a time, when people asked me which school I picked, I’d say it was one of the crappy neighbourhood schools in the Bedok area, without identifying which school it was. At the time, my understanding of the term good schools consisted of those elite schools that boasted of rich culture and produced swells of top scorers. The kind of school that you’d proudly bring up when people asked you what school you came from. The recent discussions about the relocations of Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) and Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) underscored how different the public views them. Such brand names have the ability to raise property values in a neighbourhood just by relocating there. No one would bat an eyelid if my “neighbourhood” school moved to a new space. Today, three years after I left my secondary school, I can proudly look back at my time there with fondness and gratitude. But I didn’t always feel this way. Back then, I recall feeling envious whenever I learnt about the opportunities that students from other schools had. I would often hear about the Victoria School experience of one of my close friends from primary school who had scored well for his PSLE. He’d recount all the interesting things that the Victorian experience could give him, such as a month-long boarding programme for students to live on campus. I would also hear other friends regale with stories about how they tried their hand in co-curricular activities (CCA) like shooting and sailing, which weren’t available in my school. I recall feeling jealous that I wasn’t presented with the same opportunities they were. Would I have joined sailing as a CCA? Probably not, but it would’ve been nice to have it presented as an option, rather than not having it at all. How would you discover that you’ve got a knack for archery if you never got to try it? But over time, I realised my school did prepare me for life in the way that I needed, which was to grow at my own pace. I wasn’t burdened by unhealthy expectations to excel, in the way that I might have felt if I was in a school where academic excellence is the norm. Instead, I experienced a freedom to focus on developing other aspects of my life. I had the time to cultivate my personal interests and explore different topics that weren’t covered in my everyday schooling syllabus, expanding my horizons beyond what I was traditionally exposed to. Over the next few years, I devoted as much free time as possible to cultivating my love of writing. Be it essay writing for school or my own creative stories, I wrote extensively in an A5-sized notebook that I carried with me everywhere. Though they weren’t the most well-written pieces, I enjoyed expressing myself through writing and this extensive effort ultimately improved my writing skills. Writing seemed to be the one thing I enjoyed that I was also half decent at. Any other free time that I could squirrel away was spent exploring other hobbies and interests, like learning the guitar and keeping up-to-date about international news and current affairs. Despite this, I was never able to shake away this feeling of mediocrity, not because I wasn’t confident about who I was and what I could do, but because of outsiders who have a preconceived notion about what a neighbourhood school kid represents. There is a stereotype of students like us as rowdy, lazy or just simply not as intelligent as the folks from elite schools. But this was not my experience at all. The people I met in secondary school did not fit neatly into these stereotypes and were a diverse bunch of folks from all walks of life. They might not have the best academic grades, but it is not because of the lack of trying. I fondly remember setting up “camp” at the study tables in Our Tampines Hub for six- to eight-hour long study sessions with my friends in the months leading up to our O-Levels, with some teachers even dropping by on weekends to offer us extra help. In these sessions, I hear of my fellow students scheduling late night tuition classes that could stretch until 11pm so that they could brush up on their weaker subjects. And yes, while my classmates sometimes did things that defied logic, you never know if it could result in an innovative way to accomplish things. Work smart, not hard, was what we’d say. That urge to defy society’s stereotypes of neighbourhood school students spurred me to work harder in Secondary 4 to prove others wrong. I pushed myself to work harder than ever for my O-Levels to ensure that my grades could qualify for admission into my desired polytechnic course. And in polytechnic, I was given many opportunities to explore my interests, ultimately leading to an internship at TODAY. While I still have a long journey ahead of me, it felt like I had come full circle after seeing my secondary school teachers sharing the articles that I wrote, proudly proclaiming that it was their ex-student that wrote it. I know the moment when you receive bad grades, it feels like the end of the world. For some reason, pupils become convinced that upcoming national exams are the end or be all of your life, and that it is a crucial turning point in your life that you cannot mess up. But hey, despite messing up pretty badly for my own PSLE, things still worked out for me. I won’t lie, sometimes scoring better makes life easier because you’re presented with more opportunities that will bring you closer to your goals, but there’s no harm in taking a different route to get to where you want to be. It really doesn’t matter which school we end up in. What neighbourhood schools may lack in resources and opportunities, the experience makes up for it by giving us resilience and an underdog spirit. As Hannah Montana, the icon of my Generation Z in my opinion, put it in her song from the 2009 Hannah Montana movie: “There's always gonna be another mountain, I'm always gonna wanna make it move. “Always gonna be an uphill battle, sometimes you're gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there, ain't about what's waiting on the other side. It's the climb.” There is more to life than grades, take a step back, enjoy your youth and just live in the moment. Trust the process, because at the end of that day, you’ll remember the journey more fondly than the destination.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks We were tasked to \"fall in\" outside the Maju Camp cookhouse at 6.30am. But with just two minutes shy of our deadline, I knew my section of women and I would not make it in time. TODAY journalist Loraine Lee participate in the Combat Buddy Aid acitivity during the Women’s Boot Camp on Feb 11, 2023. We were tasked to \"fall in\" outside the Maju Camp cookhouse at 6.30am. But with just two minutes shy of our deadline, I knew my section of women and I would not make it in time. I had already folded my bedsheets, packed my helmet in a bag, and filled up my water bottle. Yet, my section mates were still getting ready. I’ve heard nightmarish stories from my male counterparts about being punished for lacking punctuality during their basic military training phase in their National Service (NS) days. As one friend told me, the whole section would be sent upstairs to the dormitory, then ordered to report in again, along with a not-inconsequential number of push-ups as a punishment for being late. So when we finally left our room at 6.32am, I had a sense of impending doom. But in the name of camaraderie, I figured I might as well be late too and suffer the penalty that would surely come. But when our commanders told us not rush in case we trip and fall, then ushered us to the cookhouse for our breakfast, I was greatly surprised that we were let off the hook. I was one of 31 participants at this year’s Women’s Boot Camp — a two-day experience at Maju Camp in Clementi which gives women a chance to taste of NS life, albeit a toned-down version. Organised by the Advisory Council on Community Relations in Defence (Accord) and supported by the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps, this year’s camp was targeted at youth. Most participants were aged 18 to 20, having voluntarily signed up through their respective junior colleges and polytechnics. All had various reasons to be there, such as wanting a taster of the NS experience because they were interested to join the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Volunteer Corps, or just to understand what their male counterparts go through in their late teens. Me? I had been asked by my editors to take part in it, and I was quite intrigued by the idea. After all, who wouldn’t pounce on the opportunity to shoot a rifle? The caveat was that I had to spend a night in Maju Camp, which was quite an intimidating trade-off. It's no open secret that the physical training during NS can be gruelling, which troubled me as I’m also extremely unathletic. That fact sunk in when I realised that during the standard obstacle course, the ledge that we had to scale over, which was cruelly called the \"low wall\", was beyond my reach. As we did not have the army boots a typical recruit would be required to wear, we could only do nine of the obstacles. Admittedly, I failed on my first try of some obstacles. I somehow ended up facing backwards and towards my instructor when I scaled the ledge for the first time. I also utterly failed at trying to climb up the low rope. But another part of me did experience the thrill of being able to go through the obstacles, learning how each station serves to train NS men and regulars for different wartime scenarios. In another training exercise, we were taught by SAF instructors how to apply tourniquets and how to evacuate a casualty safely through combat buddy aid. I gleefully brought that skill home with me, showing off my newfound skills to my exasperated mother by dragging her around our home after the camp. My favourite part of the camp, of course, was handling the SAR21 rifle, the reason why I signed up for this camp. For one, I never expected weapons to be this heavy, having seen people wield them with ease at the National Day Parade. The weight of the gun with its strap around my neck weighed me down, and I wondered how people could go through the obstacle course carrying this weight, or having to endure long route marches with the rifles and field packs that can weigh as much as 20kg each. Despite this, the most memorable part of the boot camp was the enthusiasm of the other participants, who had endless questions for the women of the Singapore Armed Forces Volunteer Corps as well as the SAF trainers. “What happens during your period when you are out on the field,” asked one participant. “What are some things women can’t do in the army,” asked another. I was expecting a corporate rah-rah response about how women in NS went through it exactly like other men do, or some motivational line about how women can do it too. But their answers were refreshingly truthful, that women do experience things differently than men in the army because of practical differences. For example, one of the obstacles in the standard obstacle course cannot be performed by females because it involves putting pressure on their uterus. During outfield trainings, I was also surprised to hear that women might need to keep their used sanitary pads before disposing of them after the exercise is over. In preparation for the boot camp, I spoke to some friends about what NS life is like. One told me about the time he choked while squeezing the contents of a ration pack directly in his mouth. Another recalled how he could barely think after a gruelling route march. When asked to recite the SAF's eight core values during their \"water parade\", he gave an incorrect answer and ended up having to do push-ups. Truth be told, what I went through during the weekend was a sanitised version of NS. I had a spoon to eat my rations and didn't need to wolf down a meal by squeezing food out of a bag. I also somehow could get away with my bad jokes with my commanders during the water parade, such as when they asked us to drink \"beyond the point of thirst\". In fact, I was expecting a lot more colourful language to be used in my two-day NS experience. I think I was the only person spewing vulgarities at the camp. Nevertheless, I read some comments from netizens who thought that participants of the Women's Boot Camp got it too easy, describing the camp as an “offence to NS” that would incite women to “think NS is so easy”. This, I find, is unwarranted. The participants had joined the camp as volunteers to actively try to experience what many male Singaporeans go through, and their willingness and enthusiasm deserve applause, not dismissal. As camp organiser Joanna Portilla said, it is easy to take peace time for granted. It is also just as easy to stay ignorant about what NS men and regulars do on a daily basis to keep our country safe. Going through the boot camp made me truly understand that NS isn't easy. And the trainers and volunteers were there constantly reminding us of how much more regulars would have to do on a daily basis. I finally understood why my male friends would constantly go on about their NS experiences, because the two years they spent serving the country was a common ground to bond with others. Despite the bootcamp being only two days long, I can somewhat understand the lingo and inside jokes, although I still get confused by the numerous acronyms used. I learnt new figurative language about how I can’t run as fast as my trainer’s grandparents, for example. Beyond gaining a better appreciation of the men and women protecting our nation, I left the camp with a body ache and an army assault bag, a memento of my time there. I hope more women would get the opportunity to attend a camp like this. And if the Singapore Police Force or Singapore Civil Defence Force organises something similar, I hope I’ll get to attend it.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Last December, I had a whole speech planned out to address my cohort of attendees during the “graduation ceremony” of a leadership camp to reflect on the past four days and three nights that we spent together. Jemmima Tan Shin En, 16, is a first-year junior college student at Eunoia JC. Last December, I had a whole speech planned out to address my cohort of attendees during the “graduation ceremony” of a leadership camp to reflect on the past four days and three nights that we spent together. My team, Watch Four, picked me to represent them as their speaker, and we had spent the previous day consolidating our thoughts and bouncing ideas off each other on what to say. Quite quickly, we came up with a few main takeaways from the inaugural Our Singapore Leadership Programme (OSLP), a four-day camp organised by the National Youth Council and National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI), in partnership with the Ministry of Education. As part of the final day of the camp, I recall how changemakers were invited to speak to us and impart words of wisdom about leadership. One mentioned that we should “surround ourselves with like-minded people”. At first, I took it down in a note on my phone, as a few heads in the audience bobbled up and down in agreement. Yet, something felt wrong, and I held on to the backspace button on my phone. With less than 10 minutes to go until I was due to speak, I went on stage and said: “Surround yourself with 'unlike-minded' people. Find that common ground.” Why? The camp taught me that in order to challenge my beliefs, I had to be with people who held different views, which would either serve to solidify my convictions or break down perceptions I once held true. Before attending this programme, I had grown up in an all-girls school for 10 years of my life. From an early stage in my life, I thought I had my morals and beliefs figured out. But this residential camp, a leadership programme open to representatives from different secondary schools, succeeded in challenging my preconceived notions. With me were 53 Secondary 4 student leaders who came from MOE schools as well as madrasahs, as part of the camp’s inaugural run from Dec 5 to 8, 2022. Like me, every student leader present had been nominated by our respective schools to attend this programme. Stepping into the NACLI Multi-Purpose Hall, where the camp was held, I could not recognise a single familiar face. It was like reliving my first day of school all over again. Yet that was precisely what set this camp apart. With everyone having different backgrounds, each person brought uniquely contrasting views to the table. Everyone’s personality was a mosaic of their past struggles, present obstacles, and future victories. During the workshops organised, we tackled issues in depths unachievable elsewhere. We were encouraged to take our rose-tinted glasses off and fruitful conversations found fertile ground. Topics like our Singapore identity, the environment, and innovation were discussed as we spoke about how future generations can build a shared future. While some simple questions confounded me, camp facilitators were thankfully there to shepherd us every step of the way, encouraging us to stretch our limits and confront preconceived notions. A prime example of how we bonded was the night we spent sleeping over in the National Museum Singapore, where we traced our Singaporean roots and awed at the work of our forefathers. Despite our different backgrounds, I knew that we were in this together. With each passing day, my group members broke barriers and grew together as a team. Our differences never once sparked animosity, instead, they opened up doors for us to get a taste of the world outside our own. Above all, the meaning of leadership often popped up during our group discussions. To me, the idea of leadership has been frighteningly distorted in our modern society. Instead of a charismatic idol with millions of followers, I see a leader as a shepherd leading his or her sheep. Leading, as I’ve come to learn in my admittedly limited years of personal experience and observation, is not about holding the loudhailer on the stage. Just like how shepherds walk alongside their sheep and guide them with their shepherd’s staff, leaders don’t merely stand in the front to command attention. The best leaders leave footprints by walking the talk. They lead from within the community and within their hearts. During the camp, we had multiple chances to converse with Green Advocates – people who started social enterprises and organisations since their youth. I quickly noticed a pattern: Their ambitions were not limited by age. Some of them made a mid-career decision, others sowed their seed in entrepreneurship while still schooling, and despite their youth, these changemakers have already left such deep footprints in the sand. It made me realise that age is not a limitation. So long as we all have visions of a better future, we should not let age stop us from charging ahead and making those dreams a reality. Looking back at my camp experience, it provided new and insightful experiences, as well as deep conversations and inspiring awakenings. As we parted ways, my team reminisced with a bittersweet note, as though we were long-time buddies. If there was one takeaway I got, it would be to surround yourself with people that will spark growth in ourselves, and to take that leap and see our aspirations materialise.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks It’s been close to three and a half years since I dove into a career path within the death care industry. Rachael Tay, 23, is a corporate development manager at Casket Fairprice. It’s been close to three and a half years since I dove into a career path within the death care industry. For as long as I could remember, my childhood was filled with hearing conversations about funerals and death. As a child, I never really understood why people were always so curious about this industry or why they thought it was special or interesting. I would wonder why parents would shield their children’s eyes from a void deck wake, or take a long detour to avoid passing by a funeral. My parents, who run the funeral company Casket Fairprice as the family business, would do the opposite. They would deliberately slow down their footsteps when passing by a wake, just to take a peek at what others were doing, with me tagging along behind. They called it “market research” and it was a common occurrence for a younger me. In my mind, the idea of embalming the deceased and laying a person to rest did not feel out of the ordinary. I didn’t even realise that not many my age felt the same way. As a kid, I would stand there observing bereaved families grieve over their loved ones. The concept of death, loss, grief and mortality was something that I registered early on in life. It was this awareness at a very young age that made me seek something different and meaningful in life, but I was only able to fully understand death and mortality and how it relates to life after I began a career in the funeral industry. Prior to starting my unconventional career, I also had an unconventional education path as a school dropout. Two weeks after starting school at my dream secondary school, I dropped out of the formal education system in favour of homeschooling. Why? I craved the freedom of choice from a young age. I wasn't naturally gifted in the areas of mathematics and science, but I had an interest in the study of economics and business, which were post-secondary courses. Yes, I recognise that it is important to get a grasp of fundamentals, but a younger me was laser-focused on what I knew I wanted to pursue in life. Thus, I embarked on a homeschooling journey, where I had the freedom to decide what I wanted to do with my time. Needless to say, my decision to quit school was met with the dismay of many friends and relatives, who were afraid that I would fall behind in the rat race and turn out to be a failure. I somehow managed to do well enough to enter university a month after I celebrated my 15th birthday, pursuing a Bachelor in Business Administration at Singapore Institute of Management (SIM)-University at Buffalo. At the same time, I had the opportunity to work part-time as a customer service officer in a hair salon along Somerset. One of my favourite things about the job was the sense of satisfaction I got through serving customers and seeing them leave the salon with a smile. It was through this job that I knew that I wanted to work in a customer-oriented industry, in a place where providing customers with contentment and peace of mind comes first. Around that time, I was helping in the redesign and content creation for Casket Fairprice’s website. I remember spending hours just researching and reading up on the ins and outs of the funeral industry. Only through that did I come to realise that funerals are also for the living — it is a profession where good customer service plays a crucial role. At a time when bereaved families need the most support, the funeral operations team makes the biggest difference in making them feel taken care of, composed and at peace with the choices that they made. I was also touched by the reviews left by customers who expressed gratitude to the funeral operations team. I could really feel their sincerity and appreciation for the team who were there for them when they needed it the most. I suppose this is where the seed was first sown. For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for significance and direction in my work. Joining the funeral industry thus offered the opportunity to bring relief to the lives of grieving families and their loved ones. What could be more fulfilling than that? I wanted to know more, discover more and do more for those who are on this journey and for those that are supporting them. I was passionate about wanting to serve this community. Some might say it’s a calling, but for me it just felt right. It felt like a natural path to go back to my roots and to embark on a career that I had passion for. When I first started out, I was mostly learning and understanding about the operations behind every funeral arrangement. But the journey has not been an easy one. As part of my first few years in the business, I’ve helped to transfer bodies at the hospital, take activation calls in the wee hours of the night and even acquired an embalming certificate. Today, I’ve undertaken a more backend role, where I develop, grow and bring the company and my team to greater heights. As a funeral service provider, I know that while it is important for us to organise a dignified funeral service for departed loved ones, it is also our job to soothe the minds of the living. The thing about seeing death and grief so much is that it makes you self-reflect and puts things into perspective. At the end of the day, life is short and most things are not a big deal. I’ve learnt to take things in my stride and go with the flow. Why sour relations over something trivial? Why let egos get in the way? Outside of work, I’ve become more “cincai” (Hokkien slang for doing as one pleases), and stopped being so uptight about things. Since starting work in this industry and hearing several stories of our departed clients, I’ve come to realise that one of my biggest fears is that at the end of my life, I will come to regret not prioritising the things that matter. Having regrets is a huge burden to carry, and one example is that we often fail to appreciate the people we have around us until it’s too late. I see this play out frequently in funerals, with loved ones expressing their regrets of not spending enough time with the deceased, making amends for a past wrong, or saying the words that were left unsaid. It's sad to hear these stories, but it serves as a very important reality check. Being surrounded by death has made me more aware about the fragility of life. But there’s a difference between constantly living in the fear of death and accepting your mortality — one is crippling while the other is liberating. For me, it’s the latter. I feel that if we become more in touch with our mortality, we cease being lured away by life’s distractions and focus on what really matters. We get caught up in the many “side quests” of life that we fail to prioritise the people, dreams and goals that matter. And for me, what’s most important right now are the happiness and wellbeing of my loved ones, discovering new experiences and being able to serve the community. Since then, I’ve been able to grow, learn, and develop through the path I took. Looking back, there are many wonderful lessons I’ve learnt over the years that I wouldn’t trade for anything else.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks I would never have guessed two years ago that I would one day be the founder of a travel company that does social adventures, in spite of a pandemic that had decimated global travel. Larry Lee, who started a travel business catering to Gen Zs and millennials. I would never have guessed two years ago that I would one day be the founder of a travel company that does social adventures, in spite of a pandemic that had decimated global travel. Like many of my Generation Z peers, Covid-19 has turned my university experience upside down. I was a second-year undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University when the world went into lockdown, with what was once supposed to be the highlight of my youth turning into a socially isolating one. Instead of being a part of a raucous community of university students who could hang out after lessons, online classes and Zoom hangouts became the new norm. It was also a challenging time for my mental health. Without any physical connection to my friends, I was spending a good part of my time alone. The pandemic made me realise how much I had taken simple things like group dinners and school-wide activities for granted. But as borders reopened, I was fortunate enough to be one of the first students to go for a semester abroad for an undergraduate study programme at Denmark Technical University. So, I spent half a year in Copenhagen and my time overseas was transformative. I found myself immersed in a vibrant student community, where I got to learn with peers from all around the world. During my exchange, I travelled extensively and went on a ski trip to the French alps with 50 other students from Singapore. It was incredibly easy to connect with them as we had a lot in common. In particular, there were a few of us who were in the field of software engineering, and we quickly bonded over our interests. These connections lasted beyond the trip as we still meet up to work and eat together every now and then, more than a year later. The experience was a revelation: I experienced firsthand how an adventure could turn strangers into friends, and how it could expand our horizons in unimaginable ways. The semester abroad was undoubtedly a highlight of my university life, as I experienced personal growth, developed meaningful friendships, and discovered the joy of being part of a like-minded community. As I returned home to complete my last semester at university, I realised that upon becoming a working adult, I could lose such social experiences with large groups of like-minded peers. School would be the final opportunity for that, and my window of opportunity was shorter than most thanks to Covid-19, I thought to myself. Of course, one might argue that working life can be social too, but I believe it won’t be able to provide the experiences that school life offered me. The transition from schooling to the working world often comes with a shift in priorities and a lack of structured social experiences. Once we leave the familiar environment of school, there are no more classes or school clubs that give us the platform to meet and connect with other peers. I’ve read much about how it can be difficult for working adults to maintain existing connections, much less find the opportunity to make new friends. When I entered the corporate world as a software engineer, I experienced another sense of deja vu from those pandemic years as my company was working remotely. I wanted to meet new people and expand my network, but there were few meaningful ways to do so. Each day, I would wake up, log on to my computer, and go about my work day without a single face-to-face interaction. Most events and gatherings are short-lived, and the connections made there are often superficial and fleeting. My working days were pretty mundane and time seemed to slip away without anything memorable happening. I was reluctant to accept the reality that this would be my life for the next 50 years. So, I turned to TikTok and started posting videos asking people to ski in the French Alps with me. I made sure to use a catchy title and that was the birth of The Great Singapore Ski Trip. Soon after, sign-ups were pouring into the Google Form, which I used to gather interest in my ad hoc vacation idea. This overwhelming response from fellow Gen Zs and millennials in Singapore confirmed my suspicion: there was a strong appetite for social adventures. I realised that I was not the only one who had been feeling this way when we transition from being a student into our working lives. Many fellow Gen Zs and millennials want to expand their social network in an authentic and fun way. And what better way to meet new friends through travel, a pastime many young Singaporeans already love. Thus, the idea for Sotravel, a community-focused travel platform, was born. Nevertheless, starting the company came with its fair share of challenges. To obtain a travel agent licence from the Singapore Tourism Board, I needed S$100,000 of paid-up capital. This was a daunting sum of money for a fresh graduate like myself. I pooled my savings and there was still a significant shortfall. For a time, I contemplated giving up and shelving the idea. But I pressed on in the end, knowing that I would be letting down the community if I were to do that. Knowing that there was great financial risk, I decided to borrow the remaining capital from friends and family who believed in the idea. It was an incredibly daunting process to ask people around me for money, but it would be a huge regret if I did not try. I am grateful and privileged to have such supportive family and friends, and knowing that they had backed me up when I needed to kickstart my business idea drives me to work even harder to build something they would be proud of. I also roped in two of my friends to become partners when I realised that this entrepreneurship journey would not be possible alone. The three of us were already friends thanks to a couchsurfing trip during our exchange, and despite our different backgrounds, we shared the same belief that our idea could work. As Sotravel began to gain traction among travellers, we faced logistical obstacles as organising large group trips is a complex task. But with every challenge we overcame, our determination to make Sotravel a success grew stronger. Over time, we have become deliberate in how we designed our trips. We only host trips that are activity-based, because we understood that most Gen Zs and millennials do not want to sit on a tour bus shuttling them around monuments. We concentrated on creating travel experiences that were more fun with larger groups, such as skiing, outdoor climbing and trekking. More importantly, our itineraries were designed to break the ice, foster friendships, and create unforgettable memories. Because everyone on the trip would already have a common interest in the activity they are doing, that common ground helps build a sense of community. In the coming month, Sotravel would have brought over 130 travellers to ski, surf and climb all around the world. I never expected a simple TikTok video to evolve into a platform like this. Looking back, I'm reminded of the importance of connection, the power of shared experiences, and the magic of travel. In a world where genuine connections can be hard to come by, I am grateful to be building a community that offers an opportunity for people to rediscover the joy of togetherness.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks In my lower secondary days, I was a consistent top scorer with a near perfect score for all subjects. Gen Z speaks writer Veronica Lee Wan Ling, 23, poses for a photo at Republic Polytechnic, on May 3, 2023. In my lower secondary days, I was a consistent top scorer with a near perfect score for all subjects. Life was going to be a breeze, or so I was told. Everyone around me said that having good grades was a clear marker of success and that my educational journey would be a smooth-sailing one. Without thinking too much about it, I was admitted into a class for those taking nine-subject combinations in the O-Levels, believing that this was the norm for students who were top 10 percenters. After all, my younger self assumed that this was a path well-trodden by top performers. If others could do it, I could too. But I was sorely mistaken. I quickly discovered that sciences were not my forte. I started showing signs of struggle and gradually underperformed during examinations and tests. I wanted to reach out to someone for help, but I never did take that step in my secondary school days, having been held back by my own ego and pride. Failure wasn’t an option for someone who has had everything going for her. I decided to weather the storm, so I stuck with my nine-subject combination while endangering my mental health unknowingly. In hindsight, my O-Level results shouldn’t have been a surprise, but I remember having mixed feelings about my grades. On one hand, my L1R4 score was a single point, but on the other hand my L1R5 score brought me into the double digits. I did poorly in my science subjects, which dragged my score down. At that juncture, I should have already realised that the sciences were not for me. I had grandiose dreams of becoming a chemist, perfumer or even a biologist; the path pursuing science was tempting, with many areas of specialisation that appealed to me at that time. What I failed to consider, though, was my own limitations in those subjects. I made my decision based on what I thought I could be, and not on what I knew I could, or could not, do. That was why I was stubbornly stuck to what I thought was the right path towards excellence, and went ahead to enter the science stream in junior college. As it turns out, this was my second unwise choice in my educational journey. My life in junior college became too much for me to bear, especially with the rigorous curriculum involved. The lectures were all Greek to me, making it even more challenging for me to grasp key concepts. While I made many friends there, the steep learning curve took a severe toll on my JC journey. As such, I withdrew from the institution, marking the lowest point for me in my education journey. At that time, the prospect of my educational journey ending right there and then was an extremely real possibility. I applied for a chemistry-based course in polytechnic, again thinking that I could pull through. While I got in, I floundered again, which was not far from what I expected. I was so mentally exhausted by the time I was removed from that polytechnic due to my poor performance, I could no longer bring myself to pave another route for my education right away. With only an O-Level certificate, I took a gap year to recuperate, hoping to pick myself up again. I am glad I did. I realised that all my life, I was stubbornly fixated on two things — my dream and societal expectations — that I failed to consider reality. During this time, I realised I was chasing an artificial goal of academic excellence, without much thought towards what I wanted to end up doing. As such, I looked into as many industries as I could, given the limited options to choose from within the gap year. In that time, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to dabble with retail marketing and videography as a support staff, and also a handful of short stints on marketing teams with some companies. Through this experience, I discovered that I enjoyed creating content, and the most rewarding moment was seeing how what I created had a direct impact on the business I was supporting. This time, I knew what I wanted to do in my life, and I decided to reapply into a polytechnic to pursue a diploma in mass communication. Republic Polytechnic (RP) stood out for me, especially with its problem-based learning pedagogy, as I felt that it will help with my transition back to student life. During the admission interview, I had the chance to briefly share about my educational journey with my interviewers. I was lucky that instead of turning me away, they reciprocated with heartfelt advice. The former school director even extended me a kind gesture and brought me to RP’s education and career coaches for a counselling session, which helped to ascertain my choice. The day I received the admission offer marked the beginning of a new phase in life. Throughout my three polytechnic years, my thirst for knowledge and curiosity served as my constant motivation as I joined various interest groups, such as a student publication The Republican Post, and RePResent, a group that produces digital content for the school. I took on numerous projects with key industry partners such as Mediacorp, and participated in competitions to put my skills into practice. In my final year, I also had the opportunity to intern at the Prime Minister’s Office Strategy Group, my first work experience after my one big detour in my education journey. Being able to expose myself with these opportunities and graduating with a diploma in merit would not have been possible without the relentless support from my lecturers. Today, I am awaiting admission into a local university to further my passion in communications. Looking back at my education journey, I realised there is more to learn about myself through adversity, and despite the difficult journey I went through, I never gave up on myself. I now understand where I stand and how determined I am to get there. It hasn’t been easy, but I believe that it is okay to make wrong choices and learn valuable lessons later. The bitter taste of failure helped to shape the person I am today and gave me a greater awareness of my own strengths and weaknesses as I progress through life. Yes, I may be several years behind some of my peers, and my path might have turned out to be more convoluted than others. However, I know now that there really is no such thing as a fixed route in life, with one exception: that ignoring reality and having tunnel vision is a sure path to disappointment and regret. Instead, what matters more is reaching the finishing line. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Veronica Lee Wan Ling, 23, is a polytechnic graduate waiting to enter university.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Before the days of ChatGPT and Midjourney, I remember a time when the field of artificial intelligence (AI) was regarded as a buzzword for automating mundane tasks away. A longtime enthusiast in artificial intelligence, the author founded the first AI interest group in his polytechnic. Before the days of ChatGPT and Midjourney, I remember a time when the field of artificial intelligence (AI) was regarded as a buzzword for automating mundane tasks away. Perhaps it wasn’t seen among my peers as being on the cutting edge. In my first year at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) in 2020, most of the tech interest groups were mainly related to app development and cybersecurity. AI was not something that could compel enough students to want to start a collective of like-minded individuals. Simply put, there wasn’t much interest in an AI interest group. But as a 19-year-old who has been devoted to the pursuit of AI and machine learning, I knew that this was a field that would blow up not just in popularity but also importance. The human mind is so complex in its intricacies and it is a considerable achievement that medical science has been able to understand how it works. The next bound was for a machine to replicate what our brain does. The possibilities are endless, as the public is now starting to discover with tools like ChatGPT. So, encouraged by my lecturers who taught us to think innovatively and out of the box, I had a wild idea to start an AI interest group in NYP. I have to admit: I was somewhat worried that I did not have enough content to share with people who would join this group, or that my technical knowledge in AI was still limited. Little did I expect that the greatest challenge in forming a collective of interested students wasn’t the machines, it was in trying to decipher the human connection. I have always been interested in technology and artificial intelligence (AI) since I was a child, thanks to my father, who holds a computer science degree. And as a family, we bonded over sci-fi movies and series such as The Matrix and Black Mirror and geeked out on technological advances in the news. Stuff like the Smart Nation Initiative that the Government launched in 2014, which doesn’t often make for conversational material among people in my cohort, was something my dad, my older brother and I discussed voluminously about. Our dinner talk often revolved around how the latest tech would change our daily interactions and experiences. We would discuss and debate the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on robotics, the latest advances in machine learning, and the exciting future ahead as machines begin to pick out patterns and predict our actions. As I got older, my brother, who was studying for his diploma in cybersecurity and digital forensics at NYP’s School of Information Technology, continued to fuel my interest through his daily post-school recaps. I still dearly remember these conversations that played such a formative part in my childhood. But there remained one unanswered question of how one would set about teaching a lifeless machine to make sense of the world and make autonomous decisions, possibly surpassing human intelligence. So, hungering for an answer, I paid the library a visit one Thursday afternoon while waiting for my O-Level results and borrowed a book titled Machine Learning Fundamentals, which was published by Packt Publishing. Reading it was a revelation that kickstarted my passion in the field of AI, and what also helped was being further exposed to tech through programming Lego Mindstorms and creating games using the Alice programming environment. But my thirst for knowledge, as well as the influence of my father and brother made me want to pursue a career in information technology. So, I followed my brother’s path in NYP, securing an education in IT at NYP that would give me the rigorous academic experience I desired. As it turns out, NYP’s IT diploma programme had indeed surpassed all expectations I had. I was given full rein to explore my interests and further them with opportunities like competitions, internships and extracurricular programmes. I could always feel my lecturers’ passion for the subject in their slides and lectures, and they never failed to address all the quips I had about the industry. It was also with their encouragement that I decided to start an AI interest group at school for other like-minded students. But the initial months were the toughest phase. My first tasks: I needed to learn how to write a proposal, pitch an idea, and convince others that learning AI was a worthwhile endeavour. How do I articulate this massive train of thought into a one-liner? Why would anyone be convinced to be a part of this? Where could I find members to join my executive committee? Beyond that, I had many concerns and doubts swirling around the top of my head. While there were online materials and how-to guides readily available, I found many of them challenging for beginners to understand. I wanted to create content from scratch, from the eyes of a regular polytechnic student, so my peers and seniors could relate to it. I was glad my family was very supportive when I shared the idea with them, with my dad and brother giving me valuable advice. Especially my brother, who also had experience starting an interest group in NYP. He taught me the basics, from organisational structure to developing a proposal. What also helped was that my classmates and lecturers were by my side too, providing me with necessary feedback, even joining me for brainstorming sessions for my proposal, which I had to revise thrice before submitting it to the school. In June 2020, NYP AI was launched as the first AI interest group among all polytechnics in Singapore. But the challenges didn’t end there, as I had to make sure the group was productive and achieve the goals that the executive committee and I had set out. I still vividly recall our first event: A “beginner-friendly” project that used AI to predict housing prices. I had spent hours creating the slides and done multiple rehearsals to ensure that everyone could understand my sharing. I soon realised that my way of teaching could be overwhelming and confusing for some participants. At some point, I thought I was not cut out to teach — I was too dull and serious of a teacher. However, as NYP AI’s committee team grew and received more participant feedback, I learnt creative ways to infuse interactivity into our events. Getting student interest was another hurdle we had to tackle. We relied heavily on word-of-mouth, our blog, schoolwide email blasts and our social media for publicity. However, it wasn’t enough — we were not seeing growth in numbers. It was disappointing. For all the effort we’d put into creating the content, we wanted to reach out to a greater student population. Was NYP AI too niche, or were we not cut out to run an interest group? Our recognition increased as we adapted our teaching styles to be more approachable. Hosting events frequently definitely created visibility for us. From 30 members, we grew to 150 members in three years and continue to get larger. As we adapted and found new solutions to our problems, I thought that this is exactly what I like about AI and machine learning. Learning from experience is at the core of AI and my whole experience came full circle. My growth as an individual charting the unknowns in human relationships mirrored that of a machine making sense of the world. My greatest takeaway? It is to let go of fear, which is the core hurdle of every passion project. Do the task, because even if you fall, you will still fall forward. NYP AI would have remained a vision if I had not taken the leap of faith, it wouldn’t be a reality if I had surrendered to my fears and doubts. Looking back, this project turned out to be a humbling and meaningful experience for me. Witnessing my schoolmates’ “Aha!” moments when they finally understand an AI concept is enough to put a smile on my face. It makes the road taken worthwhile.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks “Each time the phone rings, my heart will skip a beat,” I recall my mother saying when I was young. “Each time the phone rings, my heart will skip a beat,” I recall my mother saying when I was young. When I was about six months old, I developed an unusually large bruise on my chest. My parents took me to a community traditional Chinese medicine practitioner who advised them to immediately take me to the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH). After several tests at the hospital, I was diagnosed with haemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder. Those living with haemophilia lack clotting factors to form blood clots, which means that without timely medical attention, it may be life-threatening. This diagnosis has been life-changing, not just for me, but for my whole family. Worried about not having enough money to pay for medication, my father sold the family car. He also changed his job from an electrical technician to a taxi driver so as to have the flexibility and a mode of transport to rush me to the hospital whenever I needed medical attention. To supplement the family’s income, my homemaker mother took to distributing flyers occasionally. Every three to five days, my parents would have to take me to an outpatient clinic for infusion. Each visit could take between two to four hours. When an injury happened outside of office hours, I would have to be rushed to the emergency ward where there might not be a specialist who would be able to set up the infusion procedure. I recalled once being admitted at 7pm and only leaving the emergency department at 6am the following day. My parents were apprehensive when expecting their second child, and only decided to go ahead with the pregnancy as tests indicated a negligible chance that this child will also have the same inherited bleeding disorder. Living with haemophilia meant being familiar with unexpected bleeding that can occur randomly. Within an hour, the swelling around the joints can be so painful that I would no longer be able to walk. In both primary and secondary school, my class was assigned a classroom on the ground floor so I did not have to navigate flights of stairs when I came to school on crutches or in a wheelchair, which was quite often. My early years were sheltered. My mother did not leave me out of sight, and the flooring of the flat was padded with soft mats to cushion any fall. At most, we would take short walks in the neighbourhood and return straight home. I was a sporty young child with lots of pent-up energy but cautious teachers did not allow me to participate in any physical or sporting activities during my primary school years. My only outlet then was when my parents would take me to the neighbourhood basketball court where I would be allowed to dribble and shoot a few hoops. Other than physical activities, I was also not included in other school events, sometimes without due consultation. I grew up feeling discriminated against, left out and alone. Despite my parents’ consent, I was the only one from the class excluded from the National Day Parade (NDP) celebrations, as my primary school teachers thought there were too many steps to climb at the Marina Bay floating platform. I recall how I was not offered the opportunity to take part in an overseas business trip while I was in polytechnic, and I did not know the reasons for it. I gave feedback to the school authorities, but to date I still have no idea why I was excluded. In spite of focusing on the limitations due to my condition, I was determined to explore how I can be a contributing member of society. During my time at a polytechnic, I would volunteer as a befriender to children who are sick or from disadvantaged families. Fortunately, I had a second chance to volunteer for the NDP, which is my way to contribute to this quintessential event celebrating Singapore. Perhaps more importantly, it was able to reconcile my feelings of being discriminated against nearly a decade ago, after my school left me out of the celebrations. These opportunities gave me the chance to step out of my sheltered cocoon, and I relish connecting with people from different walks of life. The best years of my life were serving in the National Service. My supervisors were very supportive and gave me opportunities to take on leadership roles. Living with haemophilia has inspired me to be a healthcare professional to explore better and alternative treatments so that others living with health conditions can have a better quality of life and thrive. I studied pharmacy science and have served nearly two years as a pharmacy technician at a restructured hospital. There are two approaches to treating haemophilia. Replacement therapy is used prophylactically (taken at regular junctures) to prevent dangerous bleeds, and importantly, preserve the health and function of joints. Together with appropriate training and the use of protective equipment, people living with haemophilia can lead physically active lives and participate in a number of sports even at the competitive level. The more affordable alternative is to seek treatment as and when needed. Due to cost considerations, my parents had to take the difficult decision to decide against using prophylactic treatment. So long as there is some bleeding, I will have to be sent to the hospital to receive treatment. It would require three to five treatments to truly end the bleeding. The expenses can be much higher if it is a major injury. During my NS enlistment, I had access to medical coverage which supported the costs of treatment. My doctor advised me to leverage the coverage to switch to a newer treatment which is currently not on the list of subsidised drugs. In those three years, there were zero bleeding episodes, which empowered me to embrace life fully. But now that I have completed my NS, I no longer have access to the comprehensive medical scheme. I have to give up on that treatment and revert to my former treatment regime which is on the list of subsidised drugs. Eight months later, a major bleeding episode occurred. I am currently using the subsidised medication. Coupled with partial charitable funding from the hospital and the Haemophilia Society of Singapore, I still have to put aside half my salary for treatment each month. Excessive bleeding in the joints and muscles can lead to longer-term consequences. Now, at 25, I have already developed arthritis, which is excruciatingly painful with each flare-up. It is hard to imagine a future like this, but I have to make the best of my condition because this is what I was born with. The reality is that people living with haemophilia can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives, and contribute like anybody else towards the community. We need access to treatment for this rare disease so that it is not dependent on one’s ability to pay but based on one’s medical needs. Those around us can lend support by seeking to understand the disease and be inclusive. Educators could set an example of inclusivity. Instead of restricting students with haemophilia from regular activities, they could include less impactful sports such as swimming or frisbee and focus on involving students living with chronic health conditions. By penning my thoughts here, I wish to invite the community to unleash the untapped potential of those of us living with haemophilia, by jointly envisaging and achieving a bleed-free future for all. Those after me do not need to live with chronic joint pain and longer-term consequences such as arthritis. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Benjamin Tang, 25, is a pharmacy technician at a public hospital. He is diagnosed with haemophilia A, an inherited bleeding disorder in which the body lacks clotting factors to form blood clots.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Over the past 20 years of my life, I have held many jobs. Gen Z Speaks writer Qistina Hatta holds a wedding photograph of her father and late mother. Over the past 20 years of my life, I have held many jobs. I’ve loaded shipments, replenished groceries, and done stints in the media industry as a freelancer. But being a daughter and a caregiver to my sick mother was the first job I had, and it was the hardest. I am the only girl among my three brothers, so my natural nickname in my family was just \"Girl\". As the third child, all the middle-child stereotypes of being rebellious were somehow not applicable to me, as I always acted as the peacemaker in the family. I was 16 when Mama was diagnosed with stage four colorectal cancer in June 2019. Being her only daughter, she confided in me about everything. I was one of her best friends. Working in so many odd jobs during my polytechnic years, I developed a sense of anxiety whenever I had nothing to do for a day and slowly became a workaholic. I would have production shoots or editing to do after school, and my weekends were spent holed up in a warehouse and then again crammed in my space to edit out videos and articles. I worked so much that I got burnt out and fell ill a lot. Mama was always so supportive, but still so worried about me. She always loved me no matter what, but I wanted her to be proud of me. Mama passed away from cancer in March 2023, a week before her 52nd birthday. Before she passed, Mama would say that she was going to see Nenek (Malay for grandmother) again. My late grandmother left us six years ago. Even till the end, she loved her Mak (Malay for mother) and wanted to spend more time with her. It is the same for me, even though I spent the most time I had in her final years being her caregiver, and staying by her side. It was the hardest job I ever had to do. However, I would do it all over again just to be with Mama. Growing up, my mother was always like a superhero to us kids. But her bout with cancer let me see her vulnerable sides. A couple of days before my Mathematics O-Level examination in 2019, I brought her to her first chemotherapy session, after she had surgery a few months prior to remove her growing tumour. My brothers were especially confident that she was going to be fine. But I knew how human she really was, and I knew that she was feeling anxious. It was her first chemo and she panicked. She begged me to call the nurses because she couldn’t breathe. She never knew how to deal with her panic attacks, and I struggled trying to calm her down. She clenched her fists to her chest, screaming, but nothing came out of her mouth. Mama was not a superhero, she was merely a human being who needed care and love. That was the first time I saw her give up. Alas, the first chemotherapy session was unsuccessful, and she never got to finish the cycle. It was too intense for her to deal with, and for the first time ever, she couldn’t do it. She never wanted to do it again. She recovered post-chemo at home, in so much pain that she would stay in bed all day. I would incessantly peek through her ajar door to see her chest move, just so I knew she was alive and breathing before I left for my O-Level examinations. It hurt me so much to see her in so much pain and have nothing to do to help her. Yet, even until her last breath, her only worry was the family she was leaving behind. Even when she was unwell and weak, she always made sure she did something, such as cleaning the house, like the neat freak that she was. She even told us to repair the plumbing in the kitchen when she was in her final days. In 2021, we finally convinced her to go back to chemotherapy to try and fight the cancer when it spread to her liver. Despite these hospital visits, nothing worked. I saw her lose hope and drift away from me. I was still a full-time student then, with after-school activities and engagements. Needless to say, I felt extremely guilty for not being there for her as much as I wanted to be. I accompanied her to as many hospital visits as I could, and I spent many lunches in the hospital. It still wasn’t enough. She fought the best that she could because she still had so much to live for. Until we found out in December 2022 that no treatments were working anymore because her organs were failing by the day — the cancer had spread to her lungs and her heart. I was in my last semester as a year three mass communications student at Republic Polytechnic when I got the news. I always felt like I had the time to be with her, that I would have at least a few more years. Struggling with my last semester, I was back and forth between school and the hospital. Just like I did, the past three years of my life. I spent so much time in the hospital that I knew which floors had the better bathrooms. However, Mama requested that she spend her last days at home, which meant that she needed someone to be at home with her. I stepped up to be there for her, though I wasn’t the only one. Thankfully, a nurse from the Methodist Welfare Services would come weekly to check on Mama’s condition too. The hospital also provided her with numerous bags of painkillers, including morphine and fentanyl, to help her manage her suffering. There were a lot of different medications that had to be given at the times the patient needed them, and I had to learn them on the job. To this end, the help I got from the hospice nurses was invaluable. Initially, all she required were fentanyl patches that I had to switch out every three days. Over time, she gradually started to experience difficulty performing simple daily tasks like standing up or taking a shower. Jaundice, caused by an increase in bilirubin in her blood as a result of her liver failing, caused her skin to turn yellower and yellower. The nurse taught me how to administer various medications to relieve her pain. These episodes came frequently in the middle of the night, when Mama would scream in pain or when she was simply unable to breathe. Being a caregiver was challenging enough, but it was especially difficult to watch as Mama deteriorated into a hollow body after each day. I couldn’t recognise my Mama anymore. Fortunately, I had a lot of support from our family. Mama was well-loved, and everyone always said that there was no one she loved more than her children. She would side with us even if we were in the wrong. Mama had our backs, always. Mama’s siblings, my uncles and aunts, came over very often to help me during the day. They wanted to spend as much time as they could with Mama, too. My two older brothers and my father also took turns helping me take care of her while I rested. The nurses and doctors who came to visit Mama always had one thing to tell me: to take a break when I get tired and to share responsibilities with my family. My father, too, was instrumental in this family-wide effort. He was the one who mostly took over me when I got fatigued, and he wanted me to rest whenever I could. He was also the only one to stay at the hospital every single day by her side when she was last hospitalized. Even with so much help, I felt so guilty for saying I was exhausted. It wasn’t just because of interrupted sleep but also because it was mentally draining. I was at her beck and call, night and day. I was bound to reach the point of burnout. I never wanted Mama to feel like a burden. One thing she hated was depending on others. She raised us to be independent on our two feet. On the other hand, I was so tired. I worked so many jobs — as many as three part-time jobs during my second year in polytechnic. But taking care of her was much more painful and tiring than I thought. Before I could reach burnout, I did what I never thought I would do. I asked for help. It wasn’t easy because Mama raised me to do things by myself. I requested that another caregiver take over at night while I got at least a few hours of sleep. However, she passed the following night. I saw my mother take her last breath as I held onto her hand tightly. I told her to let go, that we’d be okay. But at her last breath, I desperately hoped she took another. I couldn’t imagine my life without her. Many of my relatives and friends say the typical sentences you would hear, like how sorry they are or how she’s in a better place. Only one sentence comforted me the most: “She isn’t in pain anymore.” The one thing I wanted to do was ease the pain she was in, but this one sentence was the truth. It comforted me to know she wouldn’t struggle anymore. But I wished we had another adventure together. I wished for more time. She’s gone now, and I have to accept that. Our emotions and experiences will never disappear, but they can turn into something different. Grief is difficult and never goes away, but that does not mean that I should give up. I knew my limits, and I asked for help. Now, though I feel grief, I must learn how to forge ahead. We’re only humans; we feel, we love, and we fall. The grief that I feel now changes me, but it could also teach me to love harder. Her memory will live through my brothers and me forever. I know that I am not alone. I wasn’t the only one to lose her. She made me who I am today, and that is why she will always be with me because I am a part of her. She lived the life she wanted, and now it’s my turn. Mama always said: “Keep moving forward”, and so I will. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Qistina Hatta, 20, is a Republic Polytechnic graduate and is currently waiting to begin her university education.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Five years ago, everyone around me was in relationships and I decided that it was time for me to find a partner too. Gen Z speaks writer Chang Yi Tian Jolyn, 26, poses for a photo with her boyfriend, Samuel Ang Wei Jie, 30, at Gardens by the Bay, on July 16, 2023. Five years ago, everyone around me was in relationships and I decided that it was time for me to find a partner too. I was 20 then, and it occurred to me at the time that my social circle was relatively small. Even as someone who just exited her teenage years, my groups of friends consisted mainly of females from my school and my part-time jobs in F&B and retail. When I entered polytechnic, I didn’t develop any interest in the boys I met either. By all accounts, I was a complete greenhorn in the dating scene. But I knew that this status quo could not be the case, and so I started being on the lookout for someone to date. I wanted a partner who was mature in his thinking. Coupled with my lack of exposure to the wider workforce and insufficient opportunities to meet new people, I turned to dating apps to find a partner. Back then, my best friend encouraged me to download Tinder as she had met her then-boyfriend on the app. I wasn’t very familiar with the variety of dating apps but Tinder felt like a suitable platform for young adults like me who were looking to date. Since this was my first time, I didn’t want to overwhelm myself by using too many dating apps, and only focused on Tinder. That being said, I was initially sceptical about using the platform, chiefly because I might be wasting time trying to build a relationship with someone who may not share the same relationship goals and values as I did. I also feared scams given reports about scammers preying on people looking for love on networking and dating apps. I’d heard stories that people on dating apps also use the platform to widen their social circles, but I was clear on my intention: to find a boyfriend who could eventually become my long-term partner. I wasn’t sure if I could find my perfect match on Tinder at the time, but I knew that I needed to get into the dating scene and be more proactive about finding someone special. So, I embarked on my online dating journey with caution, keeping those considerations in mind and staying true to what I was looking for. I was attracted to guys who are kind, have a sense of humour, communicate well, are respectful of personal boundaries, and are filial to their parents. These were characteristics of someone who was “mature” in my books. A poll recently found that Generation Z believe that their partners and themselves have to be \"authentic\" when it comes to dating , while prioritising self-care and mental health. I also took the time to thoroughly read each person’s profile and only matched with them if they piqued my interest. This approach helped narrow down the pool of partners I was interested in. At the same time, I was conscious not to judge the person’s character solely based on their images and choice of words presented on their profile. To leave a good and authentic first impression on potential matches, I also put effort into crafting my profile, to make sure my online profile truly represented me. And so, that was how I met Samuel, my fiancé. I came across his profile a few days after using the app. His page gave me a glimpse of who he is as a person, and his Taiwan travel photos hinted that he was someone who enjoyed travel. Samuel started the conversation and we hit it off. We continued conversing daily, sharing the details of our lives with each other, sending images of our meals and talking about our favourite activities. We would text every single day and he would also constantly check in to ensure that I reached home safely whenever I was out. Back when we were still chatting online, Samuel offered to buy lunch and deliver it to my house. I was cautious not to readily reveal my address just yet or to have our first in-real-life meet-up at my place, so I rejected his offer. It was better to err on the side of caution, I thought. Looking back, I was glad Samuel didn’t walk away after this rejection. I needed to feel safe, and it helps that our first physical date took place in a crowded place that I was familiar with — a cafe I frequented. In my case, I took a couple of months to get to know Samuel through our conversations via text before the meetup. We also exchanged social media handles, so I could get a better gauge of his personality and interests before deciding to meet him. What I learnt about him also gave us more topics to connect over. I felt confident about pursuing something further, and we arranged for our first date over brunch after two months of non-stop texting. It was nerve-wracking as our date approached, as it was my first time meeting someone from an online platform, especially one who I was texting with for so long. As a precaution, I informed my brother and best friend of my whereabouts. Thankfully and fortunately so, the date went extremely well. We met every day after our initial date, going on walks together as it’s one of my favourite things to do. He eventually asked me to be his girlfriend two weeks later! We’ve always been open about the fact that we met via a dating app. Our parents were initially surprised since dating apps were not a thing during their time, but they were open-minded and had no qualms after meeting and getting to know the other party in person. Our friends also commented that it was great that we had a platform to meet as our paths might not have ever crossed if not for dating apps, and that we subsequently built a healthy relationship. A relationship takes effort, even when it comes to the smallest of things. Our relationship worked out as both of us made continuous effort to sustain our conversations daily. Till today, we send each other “good morning” and “goodnight” texts, and even share about our meals on days that we don’t have the chance to meet up. Throughout our five-year-long relationship, Samuel and I have been able to continuously learn more about each other. It definitely helps that we’re aligned on our values in life, and we still explore new experiences together as a couple — be it going to museums, hiking or attending fun pop-up events. Fast forward to today, we’ve since applied for a Build-to-Order flat and plan to get married in the next few years! Looking back at my journey, I know I was fortunate to have met the right partner by sheer chance on a dating app. I recognise that there might be many single men or women who aren’t as lucky to find the right person on an app, or are apprehensive about taking the relationship further. When I talk to my single friends about online dating, a common concern they have is their personal well-being and safety. But I believe that it is possible to take precautions when using these apps and stay safe online. The time it takes to feel comfortable with someone you meet online is not fixed for all. You don’t have to follow any timelines and will need to naturally warm up to them at your own pace. Another word of advice for singles when conversing with matches they meet online is to act on your gut. I trust my own instincts, as they usually turn out to be right. Instincts aside, people should also be rational and listen to their heads, and not be blinded by the pink haze of prospective love. This means adopting good practices, like notifying family members or close friends to check in with you after a date with someone you meet online. If you sense a red flag, don’t hesitate to stop all contact and you can also block their profiles on the dating apps. If you feel like things are progressing too quickly, and the other party is going to great lengths to earn your trust and affection, be mindful enough not to be drawn into it. For those who are considering online dating, it’s important to broaden your horizons, keep an open mind, be welcoming to new experiences, and stay safe. Most importantly, it is about being proactive in finding love. You never know what possibilities might be out there waiting for you, so why not give it a try?

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Ms Darcel Al Anthony, 23, is a Year 4 student at the National University of Singapore studying English Literature. Growing up in Singapore, my life has been a colourful tapestry of diverse cultures and languages. My journey has been one of self-discovery, introspection, and a profound appreciation for racial harmony. From enjoying various cuisines at hawker centres to celebrating festive occasions with friends of different ethnic and religious groups, I am thankful for living in a diverse country that celebrates multiculturalism. But for those with complex ancestry like me, who find ourselves at the intersection of different cultures, it is often the case that we have to grapple with the complex concept of identity. You see, my forefathers came from diverse backgrounds, including of Eurasian, Indian, and Peranakan origins. My grandparents and great-grandparents lived in a typical Singaporean kampung and spoke Malay. On the other hand, my maternal grandfather hailed from Pondicherry and was a Malayalee who spoke English, Malayalam, and Tamil. When he came to Singapore in the 1930s, he married my grandmother and picked up Malay conversationally. And so, while English became the sole language spoken at home by my entire family, I studied Malay in school, despite it being customary for most Indian students to learn Tamil in Singapore. Let me just say that I deeply appreciate how harmony between different races has been such an integral part of my family history and my own life. With my mixed heritage, I take immense pride in my identity as an Indian girl. Nevertheless, despite Singapore being multicultural, some people have found my background confusing. Although my South Asian roots primarily trace back to Tamil origins, like I said earlier, I do not speak the language. When I was younger, this caused an identity crisis for me. Unlike my friends who learned and spoke their mother tongues, and were thus able to connect with their culture through language, I couldn’t do the same. Language was just one aspect that contributed to my sense of being different. As Catholics, my family celebrates Easter and Christmas, and we do not observe Hindu festivals like Holi or Deepavali. I have been ridiculed for both my unfamiliarity with popular Bollywood music and films and my limited tolerance for spicy food. Over time, I became aware of some unfair judgements that people have made about my cultural background. It troubled me greatly that my inability to speak Tamil or follow certain practices painted me as a “fake Indian”, and true enough, others have called me that before. I was deeply distressed by the thought of not holding up to the image that many people have about Indians. Thankfully, I no longer hold such beliefs now. Just because I do not know how to speak Indian languages or follow cultural traditions does not make me less of an Indian. Over the years, I took it upon myself to learn more about Indian culture to deepen my connection with my heritage. Through literature and university courses, I delved into the history of Indians in Singapore and the myriad traditions of different Indian groups such as Gujarati and Maharashtrian, I eagerly engaged my lecturers with questions that they have always graciously answered. For example, I enrolled in a “South Asia in Singapore\" course at the National University of Singapore, where I learnt about the historical context and migration patterns of South Asians here spanning from the colonial era to the contemporary period. The course underscored the remarkable diversity among South Asians in Singapore, highlighting variations in their origins, languages, and religious affiliations, thereby dispelling the notion of a homogeneous South Asian community. Moreover, I found joy in sharing my cultural journey with loved ones who have happily joined me in my visits to the museums and heritage trails. This year alone, I have visited the Indian Heritage Centre in Little India three times. Participating in community events is also a wonderful way to connect with people from different backgrounds and understand different cultures. I regularly volunteer at my neighbourhood’s community club, and I have had the pleasure of teaming up with a diverse group of friends to create a music video for a Deepavali celebration. We filmed in Little India, engaging with various shopkeepers, and immersing ourselves in their traditional trades. We embraced the spirit of Deepavali by dressing up in colourful ethnic costumes and partaking in the festivities. We learned about the significance of Deepavali and the vibrant celebrations, such as preparing delicious delicacies like gulab jamun and creating Rangoli patterns using coloured powders to usher prosperity. Another community event that gave me new insights were the Racial Harmony Day carnival celebrations on July 21, featuring an array of fun segments like musical performances and writing Chinese calligraphy. These activities cultivated my appreciation for different cultures and revealed historical significance, like the Indian origin of Snakes and Ladders, also known as \"Parama Padam.\" Food stalls at the carnival offer beloved dishes from various cuisines, such as Chinese popiah and Peranakan laksa. It is always heart-warming to watch others, regardless of ethnicity or religion, bonding and celebrating our multicultural society. Such cultural exchange fosters a shared identity as Singaporeans. To me, this intermingling of cultures within the community is what creates a sense of belonging and strengthens social bonds. It is what helps to nurture a unique Singaporean identity that is rooted in unity and acceptance. At 23, with growing confidence and self-assurance in my identity, I learned that labelling individuals based on their languages or cultural practices is futile. Instead of labels, which serve to put people into boxes, I found that we should all welcome the idea of learning about one another's beliefs and practices because this helps to dispel misconceptions and find common ground. Today, my passion for learning more about Indian culture has remained strong as I find that connecting with one's heritage is an ongoing and fulfilling process. During my summer break this year, I had the valuable opportunity to intern with the Singapore Indian Development Association (Sinda), a self-help group supporting the Indian community. My days there gave me further insights into cultural activities and their significance. My colleagues were touched by my desire to connect with my roots and taught me Tamil phrases eagerly, without any judgement that I wasn’t able to speak the language. Such experiences not only deepened my understanding of Indian culture but also allowed me to share my background with others and fostered a mutual appreciation for different cultures. I firmly believe that racial harmony forms an essential aspect of the social defence pillar of Total Defence, as it strengthens social cohesion. By nurturing a sense of responsibility towards one another, we can all contribute to the well-being of the broader community and help build a united and strong Singapore. Although Racial Harmony Day is not officially observed at work or in tertiary educational institutions, I believe that it is necessary as it serves as a reminder to cherish the unique blend of cultures that coexist harmoniously in Singapore. In Singapore, with its diverse individuals from various backgrounds, some of us may encounter instances of racism and discrimination. Celebrating racial harmony helps to foster appreciation for each other's traditions, values, and histories, enriching the tapestry of Singaporean society. It is a part of our daily lives. I believe this is how we can continue paving the way for a more inclusive and harmonious society. As a mixed-heritage individual, my journey towards self-acceptance was made possible because I felt empowered to learn more about my own identity. I have come to appreciate the beauty of different cultures and recognise the importance of fostering understanding among my peers. It has been a long journey but I am proud of who I am. Like my favourite Singaporean dish, rojak, I am a mix of various ingredients and spices, a vibrant amalgamation of cultures and traditions.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks For 23-year-old Amelia Yamato Leow, solo travel is not about getting away, but about understanding herself better. Every Jan 1 in the Yamato-Leow household, soft and chewy mochi will be placed on the dining table at home – part and parcel of my family’s tradition in welcoming the Japanese New Year, also known as Oshogatsu. And typically about a month later, my household awakens to vibrant hues of red and gold as well as inverted “fu” calligraphy decorations adorning our walls, as the Chinese side of my family celebrates the Lunar New Year. It is through these traditions and festivals that I am constantly reminded of how closely intertwined my Japanese and Chinese roots are. But as I grew up, I am often asked which part of my heritage I identify with more. I learnt as a young girl how complex the concept of identity is, growing up as a Singaporean-Japanese who has also lived for a time in the United States, China and Canada, before finally moving here 14 years ago. Today, I understand that humans are not monolithic creatures and it is never about choosing one culture over the other. Yet, as a kid, there were moments I felt confused as to who I was, especially when I lived in places where there were certain cultural expectations and stereotypes. For example, while I was living in Singapore, the accent I picked up from living in the US and going to international schools in China led most people to assume that I wasn’t Singaporean. Conversely, when I travelled to North America, I would get compliments like “Your English is really good!”. Naturally, as a child, I would get confused about what parts of me I was meant to identify with. I’ve learnt that when it comes to being at peace with my dual heritage, it's not about looking at the differences between my Singaporean and Japanese backgrounds or the cultural environment I grew up in, but being able to embrace how different cultures can have amazing similarities. Such as the case with the Japanese and Chinese New Years, which have similar practices such as the giving of hongbaos and or \"otoshidama\" (\"lucky money\" in Japanese) in red packets from elders to children. I know that I didn't belong to only one world, but I had the privilege to dip my toes into both. Because I was brought up to appreciate the rich diversity of peoples and cultures around the world, I would bring that spirit with me during my travels, constantly going off the beaten track to learn more about how other people live. Instead of attractions that occupy the usual tourist itineraries and sit on Top 10 lists, I found myself gravitating towards places that represent the diverse heartbeat of the city or town that I was in. I loved the suburban Vietnamese restaurants in the US, the park playgrounds near family friends’ houses, the (super-sized) bags of snacks in grocery stores, and the various watering holes where serendipitous encounters and varied conversations happen. I also sought out unique experiences as a solo traveller, recently visiting Spain, Japan and Vietnam on my own. As a young adult, solo travel was never about getting away, but about understanding myself better, to push boundaries and face fears head-on. Each trip is an introspection and an opportunity to grow. To help travellers discover and understand the cultural significance of attractions, I worked together with a team of fellow travel and tech enthusiasts to develop Wunderguide, an artificial intelligence tour guide that helps save hours of sifting through reviews, websites, and maps across multiple apps. It was this yearning to immerse oneself into the pulse of every destination that we decided to create Wunderguide not just as another travel tool, but as a bridge to help travellers easily find answers to their questions and understand their destinations. Nevertheless, the best experiences are often spontaneous, as I’ve found. Last July, I found myself travelling to the vast steppes of Mongolia. There, I would discover a wordless form of human connection while staying in a traditional ger, the yurt-like dwelling that has housed nomads for centuries. Every communication with my nomadic hosts involved a tentative dance of gestures and smiles. In spite of this language hurdle, we were able to understand each other. What made the difference was the mutual desire on both sides to share aspects of our own culture, which was a kind of universal language of its own. That mutual connection was how I was able to try my hand at the age-old practice of shearing a sheep with a pair of scissors. While I was clumsy in my first few attempts, my hosts responded to my earnest desire to learn their ways, and instructed me kindly as if they were teaching their own daughter how to survive in the wild plains. Apart from the occasional laughter from the hosts when I made a mistake, there was mostly just a lot of silent gesturing. But I could sense that they shared my happiness when I finally learned the ropes. Admittedly, all I had to offer in return was some of my snacks and coffee from my previous trip to South Korea, but they later returned the favour by inviting me to share with them a traditional meal of khorkhog, a type of stone-grilled meat. To me, it felt like I was learning meaningfully and being accepted by another culture other than my own. Beyond the boundaries of being Singaporean or Japanese, I felt like someone more. My visit to the Mongolian countryside has since become a core memory. As a 23-year-old who is now back amidst the familiar hum of urban life, I have been reflecting on my experience in the ger, trying to integrate what I learnt into my daily life. I’ve come to the realisation that travel is not about the miles covered, but the memories made and the life lessons picked up along the way. For one, I've made an effort to be more patient, taking the time to connect with those around me even if the first step is the hardest. I’ve also tried to temper my urge to seek out instant gratification and be more mindful, remembering the peaceful solitude and the timeless nature of the grassy plains of Mongolia. I will also not forget the importance of observing and listening as opposed to filling silence with chatter, because sometimes silence can speak volumes. For my fellow female solo travellers, there will of course be some trepidation being so far away from home on our own. Apart from the oft-cited and correct advice of doing proper research beforehand about cultural norms and keeping trusted ones informed about your movements, there are also ways for female travellers to not let fear hinder genuine experiences. For one, opting for homestays can be wise, as staying with local family hosts provides an intimate glimpse into the region's lifestyle and traditions. Connecting with other travellers also helps – platforms like Hostelworld can help you meet other travellers. For many cities, there are Facebook groups that cater specifically to female travellers. It goes without saying that safety is paramount, which is why having a friendly face in the vicinity is key. Whether it is the vibrant canals of Amsterdam, the bucolic Mongolian countryside, hectic Hong Kong or the tranquil streets of San Sebastian, I firmly believe that solo travel doesn't mean travelling alone. Rather, it means interacting more with locals who can come from vastly different backgrounds. Doing so can enrich our own life and help us figure out our own place in the world. After all, identity isn't a static entity sealed within predefined societal boxes decided from birth. I may be Japanese and Chinese, but my identity is also the sum of all the places I've lived in and travelled to, like a patchwork of experiences and memories that define me as a person. And each step I take into a new place or a new experience enlarges this rich tapestry by weaving in new threads, including those made from Mongolian wool.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Treating myself for tackling day-to-day tasks or just because “I deserve it” turned into such a normalised coping mechanism that it had become unquestioningly harmful to my financial and mental health. After unscrupulous spending brought Larissa Santhana Nair (above) to financial rock bottom, she embarked on a month-long no-buy ban. Growing up, I’d always felt limited in buying new things. My family was financially comfortable but never rich, and my mother had to keep a tight hand on our purse strings at times. Upon becoming a working adult, receiving a pay cheque and controlling how it’s used was an immeasurably exciting concept. Starting out, I was uncompromisingly thrifty with my hard-earned money. I used Grab rides and food delivery services only for work; I did most of my shopping on Shopee and Shein; I ate out twice a week at most, keeping it to a maximum of S$30 each time. But the rigidity eventually tired me out. Endlessly scrolling through TikToks of people living their best Eat, Pray, Love lives convinced me that I should make the most out of my youth and create the life I desire. Money, I fatefully decided, can be earned back — but not vibes. I wasted no time in changing my lifestyle accordingly: I used ride-hailing services whenever I felt like it, and at least one new piece of clothing was added to my wardrobe every week. I became a magpie – except that it didn’t have to be shiny to catch my eye and get me to open my wallet! Sure, I would still try to save about S$200 a month, but any savings I accumulated screamed “extra spending” to me — which would eventually lead me to a financial rock bottom. I was on holiday in Melbourne this October enjoying the cold spring weather, the many thrift shopping options, and the delicious coffee and food. Running low on spending money, I pulled up my banking app to transfer money into my travel e-wallet and stared in dismay at my phone: I had only S$20 left in my account. Thankfully, I had extra cash on hand to tide me through to the next day, when I received my salary. But that new pay cheque did not last as long as it should have: Come Nov 1, I found myself yet again facing the exact same conundrum. With only S$400 left until the next payday, I was anxious about how I’d survive the next three weeks. What about team lunches during work-from-office days? How would I afford transportation? I also found myself grappling with a fear I’ve never known before: This was the very first time in all 23 years of my life that I did not have a cushion of savings that I or my family could rely upon in an emergency. I berated myself for not being more prudent the months before. While I could blame a culture of consumerism, I admit that there really is something so comforting in buying something when you are having a tough time — after all, it’s called retail “therapy ” for a reason. But treating myself for tackling day-to-day tasks or just because “I deserve it” had turned into such a normalised coping mechanism that it had become unquestioningly harmful to my financial and mental health. The self-control I’d exercised since childhood was switched off for such a short period of time, but had come so close to wrecking my life. I knew I had no time to waste. Immediately, I started budgeting for the rest of the month. Instead of eating Italian fusion food from a Tipo restaurant (about S$25), I headed to Saizeriya for my pasta fix (S$8). I forced myself to wake up half an hour earlier for work and scheduled all meetings 15 minutes earlier than I needed to be there in my personal calendar, and managed to avoid resorting to cabs and Grabs. Digging through my mountain pile of clothes, I resignedly listed the ones I knew I could instantly earn cash from on Carousell. I made S$20 in a week, financing two work-from-office meals. More importantly, I embarked on a ‘No Buy November’ ban till my next pay cheque. This meant I had to turn a blind eye to the typical bevy of sales launched during this month — 11.11, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and more. Frankly, I thought this would be impossible. My friends, while supportive, had a hard time believing I would be able to persevere through it as well. To my surprise, this new mission became an eye-opener for me: I learnt that I can appreciate an item — bags, jewellery, even simple things like stationery — without spending money on it. The one silver lining of my shopaholic tendencies? All the CapitaStar points I’d racked up went towards necessary toiletries. It inspired me to become a full-fledged “auntie” and start collecting points on other platforms with benefits. My crisis management measures paid off. I made it to my next payday — with S$30 to spare. Throughout my no-buy ban, I saw multiple items I desperately wanted to buy in the moment — but looking back now, I cannot specifically name a single one. This brought me to another revelation: On rough days, I feel justified to shop freely because I want to feel better, but with such impulse purchases, the rush of joy is only fleeting. I did not actually want the item I bought — rather, I liked the idea that I could have it. Following my brush with financial ruin, I resolved to turn my bad money habits around. I became diligent in tracking my expenses throughout the month with a handy Notion template. Its clear and neat categorisations help me easily understand how and where I’m spending my money. This also helps me pare down on unnecessary costs. For example, this showed me that I’ve been subscribed to certain services that no longer benefit me and it might be time to end them. A friend of mine has a “shopping risk analysis” system, calculating each item’s cost per wear: If a bag costs S$45 and can be used at least 45 times, the “value” of that bag is approximately S$1. If an item’s “value” does not hit close to S$1, he shelves the idea of buying it. I keep this in mind now whenever something catches my eye. I still buy things I want — but not all of them, and no longer on impulse. When you have a goal or purpose for your savings, it helps make the scrimping worthwhile. With a dream to move abroad someday, I definitely need a good amount of savings to fall back on. This may sound like a contradiction to what I’ve shared so far, but there is undoubtedly a beauty in shopping and treating yourself — when done in moderation. Each of us have our own personal style and character, and there’s no harm in expressing these in the clothes we don or the little trinkets we put up on our shelves and walls. However, I’ve learnt that responsible spending is about embracing personal style while resisting the urge to conform. Social media continues to expose me to a never-ending parade of shiny new microtrends and aesthetics, but I now understand that appreciating them does not mean I have to adopt them all. Real talk: I don’t think I will ever completely eradicate frivolous consumerism from my life — but I can confidently say that its hold on me has drastically weakened. With good planning and intentionality, it’s possible for me to shop consciously and authentically express myself without breaking the bank.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Whenever I hear a song from Swedish pop supergroup Abba’s greatest hits album, I’m instantly transported back to my primary school’s general office. As a kid, Jonathan Tiong was reluctant to speak much — until an inclusive educator went out of her way to encourage and inspire him. Dear readers, help us make your news reading experience better. We would appreciate it if you could take part in this quick survey . Thank you very much! When I was a child, I was always in the company of adults. My medical condition, spinal muscular atrophy (type 2), means that I need round-the-clock care . As such, my parents or domestic helper were always around. To pass the time, they would often put on music. I spent my childhood listening to classics such as Alan Parsons Project and Belinda Carlisle, and never really explored “modern” music from the post-2000s until I was old enough to use the Internet on my own. Sorry, Avril Lavigne and Katy Perry. Out of the countless acts from the golden ages of music, one that always evokes special memories for me is Swedish pop supergroup Abba. Whenever I hear a song from their greatest hits album Abba Gold, I’m instantly transported back to my primary school’s general office. The year was 2004, and I was in Primary 1. I was a quiet kid. I wouldn’t volunteer to answer questions during lessons, nor would I talk to the other children, whether socially or for class assignments. Teachers used to write in my report book that I was too shy and needed to speak up more. I didn’t have a lot of friends, and there was even some speculation among adults in my life that I might have selective mutism. It’s partly a personality thing — I’m a natural introvert, and even as a grown-up, I have to expend conscious effort to open up and connect with others. But I think my reticence was largely due to a lack of self-confidence, because I knew I was different from other kids. In any case, my unwillingness to talk was an issue. It could have resulted in other problems down the road — including social isolation due to an inability to interact with peers, and poor academic performance due to being unable to present my thoughts and clarify my doubts. In the early 2000s, the Ministry of Education was still getting up to speed on the mainstreaming of children with special needs. The position of “special needs officer” hadn’t been invented yet; nowadays, nearly every school has one. But Mrs Doris Chong, Vice-Principal at Tanjong Katong Primary School, was ahead of her time. Mrs Chong knew that special needs kids require extra help and personalised attention to ensure we don’t get left out, or worse, left behind. And, with no prompting, she went out of her way to devote time and energy to looking out for me. I still remember my very first encounter with Mrs Chong. Twice a week, while my class was having physical education (PE) lessons, I would sit at the side and watch if the activity was something I couldn’t take part in — which was the case most of the time. One day, while patrolling the school, she saw me sitting there by myself doing nothing. She came right over and engaged me in conversation — no doubt aware of my infamous reluctance to speak! From that day on, she would check on me at almost every PE period, and if I wasn’t engaged with the class activity, she would do something else with me to keep me occupied. She brought colourful balloons to these sessions, as she was a skilled balloon sculptor. She would deftly twist balloon after balloon into a mind-boggling array of shapes while chatting with me. At first, I kept my guard up as I did with everyone else, giving her short and vague answers or sometimes no answers at all. But she always spoke to me with kindness and patience, never showing any frustration at my early rebuffing of her attempts to reach out. Gradually, I realised Mrs Chong was genuine and not a threat, and warmed up to her. No doubt, the sheer novelty of having one of the most senior and respected leaders in the school twisting balloon animals for me had something to do with drawing me out of my shell too! On the last day of school that year, we gathered in the multipurpose hall for an awards presentation. Another student came up to me and said that I was being summoned to the general office by Mrs Chong. When I reached the office, Mrs Chong was standing by the public address (PA) system console. “We should celebrate and give thanks to the teachers for their hard work,” she said. Holding up a copy of Abba Gold, she continued: “I was thinking of playing some music from this album, and between songs, we could read these messages to the rest of the school.” I looked at the slip of paper she indicated: It bore a short script containing well-wishes and appreciation for the various members in the school community – teachers, students, administrators, attendants, and so on. “It will be nicer if these messages are read by a student,” Mrs Chong said. “Do you want to help me read them?” Meekly, I agreed. I had developed a measure of trust in Mrs Chong through our balloon sculpting sessions and it didn’t feel right for me to refuse her request. Besides, she’d already written the script and all I had to do was read it out – it would’ve been a bridge too far if I’d had to speak off the cuff at that point, and on hindsight, I think Mrs Chong knew it. So I held up the handset and said my first shaky words in my public speaking career, my kiddy voice echoing throughout the school. I can’t remember what all the words were, but I do recall that it ended something like this: “Now sit back, relax, and enjoy this song, Dancing Queen.” As the song played over the PA system, Mrs Chong told me I was doing well. When Dancing Queen ended, my voice was stronger and steadier in reading the next set of messages and introducing the next song. We went on like this until the script was finished. I got better and better as the exercise went on, and had even begun to find a bit of fun in it. When it was over, I returned to the hall filled with a sense of accomplishment. Sadly, Mrs Chong transferred out of the school shortly after. But what she did laid the foundation for me to begin addressing my reluctance to speak. Nearly two decades on, I still don’t relish public speaking, but I now have the capability to do it — well enough that I’ve managed to survive the corporate world, and even hold my own on discussion panels, interviews, and podcasts! My experience with Mrs Chong shows the importance of educators who care. Not only was she cognisant of the issues facing the special needs students in her school, she was also willing to come up with ideas to tackle them and invest her own time and energy into carrying out these ideas. On a broader level, Mrs Chong’s example reminds us that being inclusive does sometimes mean treating different people differently. We all need different kinds of support and help to be at our best and unlock our potential — and that’s totally okay. Mrs Chong, wherever you are, I hope you’re doing well — but most of all, thank you for the music. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Jonathan Tiong, 26, works in corporate communications and employee engagement.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Life as a Waseda student was not just about burying my nose in textbooks and juggling multiple internships; it was an invitation to venture beyond the ordinary. Gen Z Speaks writer Jeremy Tan Zheng Yi, 26, poses for a photo at Orchard Road, on Jan 22, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. I've been fencing since the age of 13, representing Team Singapore at the Asian Youth Games, World Championships and Asian Championships. In 2021, while studying business analytics at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, I was thrilled to stumble upon the Japanese Chamber of Commerce & Industry (JCCI) Singapore Foundation One-Year Study Programme. Having visited Japan before on holiday trips, my admiration for what I’d seen of the local culture as well as Waseda University’s renowned fencing team made applying for this scholarship a no-brainer — even if it required me to delay my graduation for a year. With the help of strong recommendation letters from my university lecturer and secondary school teacher, I clinched the scholarship. In September 2022, I hopped onto a plane bound for Tokyo, filled with great excitement. Life as a Waseda student was not just about burying my nose in textbooks and juggling multiple internships as I’d done in Singapore; it was an invitation to venture beyond the ordinary. At Waseda, fencing training unveiled cultural differences and a clear hierarchy between senpai (seniors) and kōhai (juniors). Formality reigned — each session kicked off promptly with all of us standing in a single row, hands behind our straightened backs, awaiting instructions. Despite Japan's hierarchical formalities and disciplined approach, the Waseda team surprised me with its open and collaborative spirit. Strategies flowed freely, discussion and collaboration thrived, and team camaraderie was not just forged but strengthened. Fencing is, by nature, an individual activity — but fencing at Waseda very much felt like a team sport. I also had the privilege of witnessing the legendary rivalry between Waseda and Keio University play out in a fencing competition, where the heightened atmosphere was unlike anything I’ve experienced before. Among the supporters was Kyosuke Matsuyama — Waseda alumnus, Olympian, and bronze medallist at the 2023 World Championships. Despite the intense competition, Waseda’s cheerleaders performed a cheer routine for Keio, and vice versa. It was a vivid reminder of sport’s remarkable ability to bring us all together. The scholarship was fully sponsored by JCCI, and I was grateful for the freedom it afforded me to immerse myself in all that Waseda and Japan had to offer without worry. However, the road wasn’t entirely bump-free. To start with, I spoke no Japanese upon my arrival. A decent proportion of Waseda faculty and students speak English, but off campus, simple things like visiting convenience stores and restaurants proved a challenge during my first few months. Some introductory Japanese language classes at the university did help, but I quickly found that the most important key was being bold enough to speak Japanese imperfectly, so as to create opportunities for myself to learn more and connect with others. Not being a natural extrovert, I made a conscious commitment to strike up conversations with strangers whenever I could — restaurant and guesthouse owners, sushi and ramen chefs, passersby seeking help with taking photos, and so on. Pushing myself this far out of my comfort zone turned out to be far more rewarding than I’d expected, leading to numerous insightful, meaningful interactions. During a bus ride from Sendai to Yamagata, for example, I found myself seated beside a young Japanese couple who seemed curious towards me but a little shy. With a smile, I took the first step and greeted them. We ended up spending the entire hour-long journey talking about our respective cultures, favourite cuisines, and even our hobbies and pastimes. This memorable encounter is a testament to the warmth and hospitality ingrained in the Japanese people, and their innate enthusiasm for connecting with others — something I may have missed out on if I hadn’t resolved to set aside my fear of embarrassment and open myself up to others. I remain in contact with this couple to this day. We’ve made a pact to reunite if our paths cross again in the future. I took countless trips to the countryside, weaving through 40 out of Japan’s 47 prefectures on sojourns that transcended the conventional tourist experience. I visited Kesennuma Koyo High School in Miyagi prefecture on Mar 11, 2023 — the anniversary of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the largest earthquake ever recorded in Japan that had claimed nearly 20,000 lives. On the school’s rooftop, townspeople gathered to share a minute of silence at 2:46pm, the exact time the disaster had struck 12 years ago. Folks gathered in groups to remember those they’d lost, sharing memories and tears. A group of aunties played tunes on little instruments that resembled seashell flutes; one of the songs they played was Amazing Grace. A group of locals, upon learning I was a foreigner, gave me a warm hug and thanked me for being there. They shared poignant tales of the area’s history, emphasising the crucial need to educate future generations about disaster prevention. Before we parted ways, they gave me a talisman for good luck. At the guesthouse where I spent the night, a specially curated dinner was served, each dish meticulously wrapped in plastic. This was the exact method the guesthouse owner had employed to conserve precious water during the disaster, as the plastic wrap eliminated the need to wash dishes with water. Partaking in this poignant act of remembrance, I was reminded of how fortunate Singaporeans are in the simple fact of our geographical location. Not being susceptible to major natural disasters, we may never be forced to grapple with loss like this. As a recipient of the JCCI Singapore Foundation scholarship, I was eager to help foster enduring connections between Singapore and Japan. Collaborating with a Japanese student through Waseda’s Intercultural Communication Centre, we brought our idea to life: A Singlish class for Japanese kids. At the time, Covid-19 restrictions required that this class be conducted online, and I didn’t know what to expect. Over 60 Waseda Elementary students logged in from their physical classrooms, their enthusiasm palpable even through our virtual connection. Teaching the kids the nuances of “lah”s and “leh”s and introducing them to colloquial terms like “chim” and “sia” turned out to be not merely a fun experience, but one that filled my heart with pure joy. The best surprise was the students’ vigorous excitement — they asked so many questions that we ran out of time. Upon returning to Singapore in August 2023, I realised that my Japan adventure had not been just about indulging personal interests. Through navigating new environments and encounters, I had developed more than just a newfound independence and resilience — I’d gained a deeper understanding of life itself. Back at home, my mum remarked on the positive change in me — a newfound stability, and a brighter, happier demeanour after a year away from Singapore. This scholarship was more than an academic pursuit; it was a lesson that life encompasses far more than stellar grades, impressive job titles, or financial success. Genuine happiness can be found in the appreciation of smaller, simpler joys, the bonds forged with others, and in embracing new perspectives and experiences. Above all, life’s true treasures often hide in the most unexpected places, awaiting discovery by those who dare to venture beyond the familiar.

For 26-year-old Delonix Tan Wei Jie, his childhood years were defined by constant rebellion and academic struggles. This audio is AI-generated. Growing up, I was no stranger to trouble. Constant rebellion and academic struggles defined my childhood years. Being a loud-mouthed kid didn't help either; it made me an easy target for the notorious seniors during my lower secondary years. This marked the beginning of a tumultuous journey. Studies was never my strength, and I sought validation outside of it. In Secondary 3, I found myself entangled with the wrong crowd in my neighbourhood, getting into fights, alcohol, tattoos, and gang affiliations. Being in gangs gave me opportunities to “solve” other members’ issues and feel “recognised”. It gave me a false sense of importance and progress — something that I couldn’t get in school. By Secondary 4, I was studying at home due to school policies against tattoos, and facing the threat of expulsion. Deep down, I felt that I had something to prove so I did put a lot of effort into studying, even asking my then-classmates for notes I could borrow. Against the odds, I ended up passing my N-Levels and was eligible to progress to Sec 5, but I instead decided to apply for the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Despite making it to ITE, my association with gangs continued, leading me to juvenile lock-up not once but twice, for illegal assembly and assault. Luck was on my side, as being underage spared me from getting a criminal record. Getting expelled from ITE, however, was a wake-up call. I was just six months away from graduation. The police came looking for me after a rioting incident; I wasn’t at home at the time. Later, during the taxi ride to the station, my parents just kept quiet. They didn’t say anything, even when we reached the station. Before the police took me into lock-up, my mum broke down in tears and hugged me. She told me not to be scared, and that everything was going to be okay. She didn’t blame me at all. That broke my heart. I spent the night in the station thinking hard. How lucky I was to have parents that loved me unconditionally, even though I’d screwed up multiple times. At the end of the day, I realised, only family stands unwavering at your lowest. They’re the only thing that truly matters. This pivotal moment prompted a journey of self-discovery and transformation. I turned to self-help books, and worked hard to adopt healthier habits like eating better, working out, journalling and meditation. I gradually broke ties with old friends. I did my National Service while concurrently pursuing a private diploma in business administration, followed by a degree in business management. It wasn’t an easy process: I lost my sense of identity, my friends and my direction in life. It was a long, difficult road of change, one that I had to take one step at a time. There were moments along the way when the allure of my old ways tempted me. It was especially difficult during the initial phase. Sometimes it was boredom, when old friends asked me out to drink. Other times, I felt overwhelmed by the difficulties and stresses of day-to-day life. But my new self-help routine kept me grounded, and my family provided the constant support I needed to stay on track. I even crafted a vision board for myself, setting out a timeline and milestones for things I want to accomplish during my lifetime. This helped to make things clear and distinct, instead of existing only as ideas in my head. During this time, I realised the potential to use my influence for a positive cause. Instead of recruiting people to gangs or influencing them in a bad way, I could channel my energy towards building something meaningful. Venturing into entrepreneurship, I started my own cooked fishball noodle stall — an expansion of my family’s wet market fishball business — as well as a self-photo studio. Though these endeavours didn't unfold as planned, they helped me to realise my passion for business, and laid the foundation for building our family business brand. I am now a full-time regional salesperson selling copier supplies throughout Southeast Asia. I’m still with my family’s fishball noodle business, building our brand and creating social media content. I have also implemented preorders, and launched our very first website. I also helped to improve operations efficiency by outsourcing mundane tasks such as the chopping of yellowtail fish meat to our supplier. Under my charge, our social media following grew to over 10,000 on Instagram and Facebook, and over 5,000 on TikTok. Some of my content also went viral, helping us to get noticed by a few news channels and further boosting sales. Now, as I reflect on my journey, I am extremely thankful for the second chance and opportunities that I have received. I realised that the adversities I experienced weren’t just stumbling blocks in my way. Instead, they have moulded me into a stronger person who appreciates the simple yet crucial aspects of life — family and health. Early failures in school and life inoculated me against the fear of failing, allowing me to block out external opinions and judgments. This is extremely helpful now, enabling me to fully focus on doing what I want and like to do, instead of what other people or society wants or think is “cool” or “good”. Not being afraid of failure or judgment also gives me the courage to take more risks and experiment with my ideas and interests. Had I been a straight-A student, the depths of my character — resilience, self-determination, and more — might never have surfaced. The many rejections and failures of my youth became the catalysts for discovering my true passion for sales and business. The teenage me would have never imagined myself doing what I am doing now. Currently, my focus lies in continuous self-improvement and cultivating meaningful connections. For me, building our family business brand isn't about fame or fortune, but a journey of consistent improvement and progress — it’s about the person I am becoming each day. Entrepreneurship and sales, to me, are forms of self-cultivation, measured by the rate of growth and change. The pressure never eases and the challenges never end, but the fulfilment derived from overcoming these fuels my desire to evolve and grow as a person — the ultimate high that I continue to chase. Life will always be unpredictable. I’ve learned that it’s better to see adversity not as a hindrance, but to embrace it as a catalyst for positive change and growth.

My partner and I crossed paths towards the end of 2019, while studying at different universities in Edinburgh, Scotland. We were set apart from the start: He’s from Malaysia, and I’m from Singapore. But we didn’t expect to be parted from each other so soon. We spent just two months together before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, forcing us back to our home countries. Thus began a 15-month stretch of long-distance dating, divided into two legs — one from March to September 2020, and another from May 2021 to January 2022. Having never visited each other’s cities, we struggled to visualise each other’s daily lives and relied heavily on video calls and photographs. But even with modern technology, connection across physical separations cannot be guaranteed. Countless conversations got cut short due to poor Wi-Fi or last-minute plans. Given that we hadn’t spent much time together in person, virtual communication proved tricky as we were not used to each other’s tones and reactions, which sometimes caused frustration and disappointment — the core of which was a sense of disconnection and a desire to hash it out in person. Coupled with the uncertainties of the ongoing pandemic, there were times it felt tortuous and never-ending. On the flip side, being closed off from the outside world made us more open and vulnerable with each other. Early in the relationship, we set boundaries, discussed fears and anxieties, and swapped childhood stories. In September 2020, Singapore’s borders with Malaysia were tightly shut and would stay so until 2022. We chose to spend the next eight months continuing our studies together in Scotland. But the reunion, though long-awaited, initially felt bittersweet and strange. After becoming accustomed to seeing and hearing each other through video and flattened digital transmissions, meeting in person felt almost like encountering a stranger. We had to get accustomed to physical habits and relearn routines, both our own and each other’s. It also felt like we had a silent agreement to cherish the limited time together. After all, we didn’t know when the next bout of long distance would start again. Truth be told, this made for a lot of particularly hard, isolated days during this time — but I wouldn’t exchange the toughest of these for anything. It taught me not to take things for granted, not even mundane things like getting groceries or doing laundry together. Still, doubts lingered in my mind: With him graduating and returning to Malaysia while I still had a year left in Scotland, how long would this last? Even if we did make it through all that, how were we going to eventually close the gap? When the eight months were up, it was a harder goodbye because there was no end in sight. I knew this second round of long-distance was going to be even tougher than the first. I was in my final year of university, with assignments, exams and my dissertation at their most intense. My partner found a job in Malaysia that took up much of his time. Further complicating things was an eight-hour time difference, which we had to spend much of our limited free time contending with and working around. Throughout it all, the uncertainty of when we could bridge the geographical gap between us weighed heavily on our minds. We learned the importance of compromise, putting effort into changing our routines in order to match up free times, and communicating as much as possible. We made intentional efforts to strengthen our bond: Virtually meeting each other’s families, sharing an account for updates on days we couldn’t talk, and even starting a “count-up” log to track our time apart, which motivated us to keep going on difficult days. We scheduled date nights — and didn’t skimp on them either, indulging in multiplayer Steam games, karaoke sessions, movie nights on platforms like Scener, and sending gifts and food to each other’s families. We also started getting on Skype calls not to talk, but to leave a window of connection open as we went about our routines, allowing us to share mundane aspects of our lives with each other and building our shared intimacy in a way that did not impede our schedules and commitments. Upon graduating, I returned to Singapore in May 2022. The opening of Singapore's borders with Malaysia in December 2021 had also brought a profound sense of relief. While the physical separation remained, knowing that we were no longer restricted by closed borders was a big load off our minds. My partner quickly secured a job in Singapore and moved here, a transition that presented brand new challenges: From balancing family visits in both countries to making decisions about settling down and housing arrangements, all while striving for a work-life balance. Being in the same city brought comfort, allowing us to explore each other's childhood neighbourhoods, meet each other's families and friends, and immerse ourselves in each other's lives and cultures. Despite my partner’s constant reassurances, the sacrifices he’s made to leave his home country for mine weigh on me. He can't see his family and friends as frequently as before, and misses significant events like birthdays and funerals. On my end, I try to help him plan out his leaves and flights, and accompany him whenever he goes back to Malaysia — aiming to support him while building stronger connections with his family. Dating long-distance for as long as we did definitely affected our relationship, especially at such a young age. But it made a lot of positive impact too. One example is the evolution of our communication: Moments where we struggled to understand each other's tone and body language taught us to share our thoughts and feelings with each other more directly and openly. Our long-distance stints have also underscored the importance of a strong foundation and friendship in a romantic relationship. Without a mutual commitment to building a strong emotional bond and supporting each other through hard days, any obstacles — geographical distance included — can feel overwhelming. We're fortunate that our families have been incredibly supportive from the beginning, taking time to get to know each other over meals and consistently prioritising our needs and aspirations. It couldn't have been easy for them to watch us embark on this journey amid the uncertainties of the pandemic. Any long-distance relationship isn't easy, whether it’s romantic or otherwise — but they also offer plenty of opportunities that would be impossible in a “conventional” relationship. If you keep the faith and hope, the distance stops being a hindrance and becomes an incredible means of deeper connection. As for me, I’ve stopped fixating on the obstacles in my way. Instead, I’m choosing to focus on how we’re going to overcome them together. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nicole Chan, 24, is a communications strategist by trade, and a digital native by passion.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks My issues with my appearance first started during puberty. The author's issues with her appearance first started during puberty. This audio is AI-generated. My issues with my appearance first started during puberty. I had gone through the regular cycle of a growth spurt, marked by big changes in my height and weight; but nothing could’ve prepared me for how much my bust would grow. In Primary 5, a classmate looked at me and said, “Dude, I can see your boobs. They’re so obvious, did you wear a bra?” I had, of course, worn a bra — but the embarrassing call-out opened my eyes to notice, for the first time, that my bust was larger than everyone else’s. I also noticed that my thighs had become thicker; the skinny, pre-puberty body I had was gone. It clicked in my head that the way I looked could be an uncomfortable sight in the eyes of those around me because it went against the grain of Southeast Asian beauty standards. I had always been encouraged by my mum to embrace how I looked and be comfortable in my own skin. But from this point on, I suddenly realised how societal beauty standards place us all under intense scrutiny and pressure, even at such a young age. Over the next few years, it became more and more apparent that my figure was different. Being heavily invested in fashion, I was acutely conscious of how certain clothes would look on me and the reactions it could warrant. I would pay attention to the forecasted designs from fashion week and other catalogues or style icons of the mid- to late 2010s. Labels like Brandy Melville caught my eye, a trendsetting brand known for catering to ultra-skinny girls. Each time I visited the store with friends, I would wait outside the changing room and look at them trying on piece after piece, thinking of how these pretty clothes could never look good on me. In my naivety, I thought that the style icons of the time — Gigi Hadid, Blake Lively, Kylie Jenner — set the standard of what women should aspire to look like. I strived to replicate their outfits and appearances. Pop culture influences such as these illustrated the silhouette that I “should” have. It was impossible, no matter how many diets or exercise regimes I tried. One reason why is that my body looked good the way it was. I wasn’t overweight; I just wasn’t the size-zero model you see on magazine covers or when you’re shopping online. Any professional stylist would also tell you that the type of wardrobe that is suitable for you is very dependent on your figure and your features. While I understood the concept, I struggled to actively apply it. For my 18th birthday, I wanted to wear a gingham-patterned crop top purchased for the occasion. When I tried it in-store, it seemed to fit — but on the day itself, my reflection seemed foreign, and thoughts of how I despised the way I looked swirled in my head. I felt “unworthy” of pretty clothes. All through ages 18-22, I embarked on various diet plans and exercise regimes to achieve a figure that I could be happy with. It worked out most of the time, but whatever results I obtained came at the cost of my health. There were days I would forgo entire meals just to feel “healthier”. This was a short-term solution, of course, because I would always find newer problems to pick at: ‘My nose is not small enough’, ‘My jawline can be sharper’, ‘My tummy is not flat enough after meals’. In the last few years, the world has seen an increased representation of women with a variety of body shapes and types in the media, like Kat Dennings and Ashley Graham. Such representation encouraged me to work harder on positively affirming my body and the way I looked. I took up pilates, each session of which concluded with the instructor inviting us into a moment of gratitude for our bodies taking us through the exercise and for all it does. These helped me forge a more wholesome mirror through which to see myself: “I’m thankful I have a tummy that protects vital organs like my uterus,” I started to think. “My thicker thighs support me during muscle training.” Bit by bit, I managed to build a newfound confidence that made me feel more beautiful. I learnt that I am healthy and uniquely me, and any modification to my looks should be an enhancement of myself, rather than a “necessary” improvement. Confession: Despite the strides I’ve made, I still struggle from time to time — when I’m bloated after a meal, for example, or indulging in unhealthy snacks when I have not been working out for a while. I take a longer look in the mirror to identify my “flaws” and how to get rid of them. Sometimes, I even have a difficult time leaving the house, because the thought of putting on an outfit that can make me feel good is a heavy weight (no pun intended). What helps a lot is remembering that being loved is so much more important than being skinny — my friends and family remind me of this every time they tell me I look beautiful even when I am overthinking an outfit. Through social media platforms like TikTok, I’ve been able to see so many women of different shapes and sizes and know that my struggles with my body is a shared, universal experience. It’s comforting to see styling videos where a girl might have a bit of a tummy like me wearing a low-waist skirt, or a busty girl donning a top that heavily accentuates her curves. I’ve come a long way, but I’m still a work in progress. What I can share is this: If you’re struggling like me, it helps to first redefine beauty for yourself. To me, beauty is no longer about a number on a scale; it’s about presenting the best version of myself to the world and doing what makes me feel good. If a simple jeans and T-shirt combination is what makes me feel comfortable, I know that I am gorgeous.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Now that \"Taylor Week\" is over, what have we learned? You wouldn’t need to be one of the lucky ones that made it into the National Stadium to know the joy that Swift’s six shows here have brought — but not all was sunshine and rainbows. This audio is AI-generated. If you’ve never heard a Taylor Swift song in your life, you must not have left your home for the month of March. The pop sensation set off major waves when she first announced not one, not two, but six shows in Singapore as part of her behemoth Eras Tour. In the lead-up to “Taylor Week”, her music quickly became the soundtrack of our nation, blasting on the radios, in shops, malls, even as background music to countless social media posts. The megastar even made her way to our Parliament, where members of parliament took turns exchanging mentions of her hit songs. “Are you going to see Taylor Swift?” was the number one question from the lips of fans and non-fans alike. (For the record, yes, I queued outside a Singpost outlet for nearly 24 hours for my tickets). Reflecting on the past week as I try to recover from my PTSD — Post-Taylor Swift Depression — one thing’s for sure: Swift’s presence here has brought out the best and the worst in all of us. You wouldn’t need to be one of the lucky ones that made it into the National Stadium to know the joy that Swift’s six shows have brought. The pop star herself wasn’t the only reason to smile: A fan sold his tickets to two foreigners who were crying outside the stadium after being scammed, people cheered wildly for the lucky Swiftie who got Swift’s coveted 22 hat during the concert, and the list goes on. The spirit of togetherness wasn’t limited to just Singaporeans, either. Economists estimate that about 70 per cent of concert-goers were visitors from out of town — not surprising, considering the way their shouts overpowered those of Singaporeans’ during the shows whenever Swift asked who travelled from abroad. On one night, I entered a stadium restroom to find two Swifties from China giving out temporary tattoos to concert-goers from Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia. Fans from around the world spent the long hours waiting for Swift to appear on stage complimenting each others’ outfits and singing their hearts out to the same songs together. Attendees eagerly participated in the friendship bracelet trading trend kickstarted by Swift’s song You’re On Your Own Kid, swapping the handmade accessories with friends and strangers alike. I saw several children with bracelets stacked up halfway to their elbows. One mother told me that fans had been giving her children the bracelets without asking to receive one in return. Their kindness warmed her heart, she said — and mine too. Some concert-goers also dressed up in Swift’s “Junior Jewels” pajama outfit from her You Belong With Me music video, armed with markers for other attendees to doodle their names or favourite song title or lyrics on the shirt. The hype was no less outside the stadium, where hundreds of fans held picnics to sing along to Swift’s performance. Videos of their reactions to her surprise songs flooded social media, and many gave tips on the best spots to watch the stadium light up online. It seemed that with or without a ticket, everybody who wanted to join the fun managed to find a way to do so. In the midst of all these, it struck me that there’s nothing quite as enchanting as watching people from so many cultures and countries coming together to celebrate the same occasion. But not all was sunshine and rainbows last week. If there’s anything to take away from the viral videos of people crying outside of the National Stadium and countless warnings from the police, Taylor Week was a free-for-all for scammers. At least 334 people fell for these scammers in the first two months of the year, with total losses then amounting to at least S$213,000 . A 29-year-old was also charged with allegedly cheating fans with tickets to Swift’s sold-out show on online marketplace Carousell. Also killing the vibe was the fact that some fans had been forced to buy their tickets for upwards of three times the price, as they lost out to computer bots programmed to help scalpers snag seats faster than us plebeian humans could. Scammers and scalpers aside, another source of negativity was some Swifties themselves. When Eras Tour ticket sales launched in October, millions jostled in the virtual queue for a spot in the National Stadium in what was quickly dubbed the “Great Ticketing War”. Due to the hyper-intense competition, some Swifties have dealt with disappointment by showing hostility towards those that managed to snag tickets. The recording of a woman complaining how concert-goers did not know the surprise songs — tracks not on the regular concert set list that Swift sang each night — became a trending TikTok sound. Embittered fans complained how some attendees sat down as Swift sang slower songs from albums such as Folklore and Evermore. Even some concertgoers not dressing up for the show had a small portion of Swifties up in arms over who “rightfully deserves” tickets. As someone who sat down for parts of the concert, I’m defending my decision. It’s exhausting to stand and dance for more than three-and-a-half hours straight — props to Swift for doing so all throughout the tour. Even despite taking a break during All Too Well, my legs were aching for days after. Several Swifties also got snobby about the trading of handcrafted bracelets, stating online that they only wanted to trade with people who had “nice” bracelets too. But where’s the fun if it's only about looks? They’re friendship bracelets, after all — not fashion bracelets. Outside the Swiftie community, stories of people enjoying their time at The Eras Tour inevitably drew party poopers chiming in with a disparaging “Ew, who is Taylor Swift anyway?” But you don’t have to love Swift nor her music for yourself. It doesn’t hurt to let her many fans have some fun — while benefiting our economy too . From what I saw, Swift’s presence here alleviated some of the rigours, tensions and fragmentations of everyday life. Taylor Week wasn't just a bunch of bejewelled concerts. It was a reminder that despite the pressures and stresses of the challenges we face today, we can still come together as friends, neighbours, or even as strangers to have fun, or even just to share in each other's excitement for the same thing. So what now? How do Singapore’s Swifties move on from the greatest week of their lives? It’s anyone’s guess what the next big thing will be to sweep us all off our feet — but, when the time comes, what would greatly enhance the experience is not having to deal with this level of ill intent and contempt towards the throngs of people excited about having some good-natured fun. For now, I’ll relive the joys of Taylor Week in Singapore by streaming The Eras Tour concert film on Disney+. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Loraine Lee is a journalist at TODAY covering politics and people.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Like many of young Singaporeans of my generation, I was first exposed to community service and volunteerism through a compulsory school activity. When she started on her green activism journey, 20-year-old Christina Gan Tze Xin struggled with cynicism and scepticism from her family and friends. This audio is AI-generated. GEN Z SPEAKS: When 20-year-old Christina Gan first started on her green activism journey, she was dismayed by her family and friends' cynicism and scepticism. Eventually, she found her tribe among like-minded groups and learnt the most important lesson of all: That no one can save the world alone. Like many of young Singaporeans of my generation, I was first exposed to community service and volunteerism through a compulsory Secondary 2 school activity where I spent time supervising children with special needs, like those with high-functioning autism, to create simple foods like peanut butter sandwiches. Each session was an eye-opening but unsettling discovery of new and more complex obstacles the children, their parents and caregivers were subject to educationally and socially. It soon kickstarted my passion for volunteering. Now six years on, I have had the opportunity to serve a diverse range of communities through organising activities in Care Corner, Heartware Network, CaringSG and more. In the last two years, I became interested in driving action against climate change, which I believe is the most pressing humanitarian crisis right now. When I first started out, I made significant lifestyle changes to limit my consumption of meat, plastic, and energy to reduce my personal carbon footprint. While I knew the impact might be small, I was confident it would still be tangible. In bright-eyed hopes of motivating others to do the same, I explained my rationale to my family and friends. To my surprise and dismay, I was met with cynicism and scepticism. Many bluntly pointed out that my actions would not have any impact at all, instead bringing up that my new dietary restrictions would make having meals together inconvenient. I was still dedicated to these changes, but I quickly became frustrated that those around me seemed to belittle the significance of my hard work and were not willing to limit their consumption as I had. I was jaded, and wondered if my efforts were, despite my good intentions, truly worth anything. In my search for answers, I found that I was not the only one in this state of confusion. After attending many environmental events, I found a place among other environmentalists and within green organisations like NUS College’s Ecoplanet and the Students’ Association for Visions of the Earth, both at the National University of Singapore. It was only when I found a community of individuals who shared similar frustrations that I realised: Forcing people to make inconvenient or burdensome changes to their lifestyle will only reduce their receptivity to our green mission. Discussions with these like-minded folks taught me not to lose hope, but to channel my energy and passion into broader initiatives such as policy changes, education, and top-down approaches. In 2021, I started Project Step by Step, an initiative under the Youth Action Challenge, aimed at addressing food waste and establishing a circular economy through compost. The aim was to encourage collaborations between farms in need of fertiliser and the largest generators of food waste — namely schools, restaurants, malls, and residences. A survey of 180 volunteers from 112 social service agencies in 2023 by the Singapore Management University’s Lien Centre for Social Innovation and the National Council of Social Service identified a lack of time as the leading reason for volunteers to discontinue their service. Amid tightening time constraints, maintaining focus is increasingly difficult with so many demands and distractions constantly vying for our attention. In 2000, a Microsoft study found that the average attention span of a human being was 12 seconds. In 2015, that dropped to a mere 8.25 seconds — even shorter than that of a goldfish! If we want a more compassionate and equitable future, it is imperative that we start to prioritise volunteerism as a fundamental activity for everybody from all walks of life, not just for the good of society but also for ourselves. Our generation is deeply invested in self-fulfilment, dedicating significant resources to personal growth in areas such as fitness, appearance, happiness, and success. However, true individual growth cannot be achieved without empathy and social responsibility. Without these, we risk building self-righteous lives devoid of meaningful connections. Additionally, volunteerism compels us to exercise greater patience, particularly when interacting with those who may have difficulty grasping concepts or communicating effectively. Regardless of whether you are interacting with an overstimulated child with autism, providing support to an isolated senior citizen, or navigating communication barriers with migrant workers, each volunteerism encounter strengthens your empathy and tolerance. Engaging in causes larger than ourselves also brings us a sense of purpose that surpasses personal achievements. Volunteering is also the gateway to finding one's community, which is not just beneficial but essential for those impassioned by social impact. My community helped dispel my previous notions of powerlessness, instead imbuing me with a fresh agency to tackle climate issues. Here are three reasons why the importance of community cannot be overstated: Firstly, a community will intensify your passion. Alone, I felt helpless and powerless in the face of the enormity of environmental issues. But the values, goals, and experiences shared with other environmentalists showed me that I’m not alone in this race against time. This sense of belonging continuously renews my vigour and determination to drive meaningful and enduring change. Secondly, a community can exponentially amplify the impact we make. Through collaboration, we can pool our individual resources, expertise, and perspectives, resulting in outcomes that far surpass the sum of individual efforts. This collective synergy fosters innovation and resilience, leading to more impactful solutions that are both effective and sustainable. Lastly, a community is also a crucible for personal growth and development. Interacting with a more diverse range of people provides us with more exposure to diverse or challenging perspectives and criticism. When I first adopted a vegetarian diet to reduce my carbon footprint, it was my green community that helped me realise my misconceptions. They talked me through difficult criticisms from naysayers, and posed thoughtful questions to help me process the reality that one person’s avoidance of meat may not make the most pronounced difference. Rather than reacting defensively, I learned to pause to assess the feedback objectively and pinpoint areas for personal growth. Now, I use my diet as a tool to start conversations about meat consumption and unsustainable production practices. As a young person in Singapore, I understand how easy it is for young Singaporeans to become too absorbed in our personal concerns. But let’s not overlook the urgency of broader global issues that pose a real and immediate threat to not just ourselves, but our families, country, and fellow human beings across the globe. By thinking beyond our individual concerns and committing to serving others, you may discover that your journey of self-discovery can be catalysed by the simple first step of volunteering.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Dear Ma — in the year 1998, Bill Clinton is impeached, George Clooney charms his way through the hit show ER and into your affections, and you become a mother. Ms Angelitha Jayaraj (left) and her mother, Mdm Sujatha Philominraj, at their home on April 28, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. Dear Ma, In the year 1998, Bill Clinton is impeached, George Clooney charms his way through the hit show ER and into your affections, and you become a mother. The year I am born, you are 25 — the age I am now. You are comfortably married, with a stable job to boot. But while you’ve been trying for a baby for five years now, 25 years into the future, I will succumb to the very modern notion of “finding myself”. Exploration and reinvention will be the norm for most young adults, even if one is a woman with a “ticking biological clock” — a phrase that is no doubt only mildly less offensive to you now than it will be to me a couple of decades later. My grandmother, your mother-in-law, often said that women leave their best years behind much earlier than men, but you will never let me believe that. I cannot help but wonder if anyone has ever told you not to believe it either; if you knew, at age 25, that you had other options. It’s a thought I can’t bring myself to express to you out loud. After all, I exist because you wanted me. The trappings of motherhood must appeal to you in a way it hasn’t quite yet appealed to me — certainly not “trappings”, in your view, but a gift. Here in 2024, the idea of being wholly responsible for someone other than myself makes me almost sick with panic. But I’m young and it’s fine that I feel this way. Normal, even. You seem to think I’ll change my mind in due time, seeing as you have names picked out for your hypothetical grandchildren. Still, my decision to enter into parenthood rests in my hands, a privilege many women before me have not known. I’m not against a hypothetical version of me becoming a mother — a put-together, responsible, perfect, future version of me. But that person doesn’t exist yet. Did you have the luxury of waiting for that version of yourself? Maybe that’s an unfair question. You were born in India, one of four children. As the eldest daughter, you were perpetually taking care of something or someone. With your parents working around the clock, you had to grow up just a bit faster to fill in the empty spaces. At the age of nine, you learnt to cook warm sambhar, rice flecked with cumin, flat, round chappatis, and much more. You knew how to slice onions so they were perfect and thin, even through the tears they brought to your eyes. You have cut many a chicken’s throat, emptied its guts and plucked its feathers without flinching, the way your uncle taught you. Your siblings look to you for full bellies, steady reassurance, and gentle discipline. Maybe that’s what it is: You had motherhood thrust upon you so early, and my birth will merely be a natural extension of the shape your life has already taken, a trajectory that’s been decades in motion. Perhaps you wanted what you already knew. The year is 1998 — but five years ago, the man who is now your husband took one look at you and decided he was never again going to leave your side. Your father adores him, which helps because you adore your father. (Years from now, you will constantly tell me I’m just like him: Tall, well-spoken, frustratingly unshakeable. It will become one of my favourite ways you tell me you love me.) The man who would become my father did leave you one last time — to get his affairs in order here in Singapore before he could officially marry you. You exchanged letters with him during this separation, letters in which he endeared himself to you so irrevocably that you were willing to leave an entire life behind and make a new one with him in a new country. The whole thing is undeniably sweet and makes me irrationally embarrassed of my generation’s obsession with dating apps. (It’s a long story, but mobile phones will one day be able to find you love. Or at least a temporary substitute for it.) Fortunately, three decades into your marriage, you and my father will remain cloyingly, undeniably sweet — much to your children’s chagrin. Perhaps I am simply the result of your love and the life you wanted with him. In 1998, leaving one’s family and one’s home for a new one is a daughter’s lot in life. Even so, the concept is not something I can comprehend. I can’t imagine being thousands of miles from you for more than a few months, let alone in perpetuity. You will make a wonderful life for yourself here in Singapore, filled with love and respect. You will have a new family to contend with and care for. You will become indispensable to those you work with; competent, personable, a leader in your own right. You’ll make friends wherever you go and charm all of mine too. Even so, the idea that you might feel the same strain of separation from your own mother sends a bolt of guilt through me. Perhaps that’s irrational (and slightly narcissistic) of me, though. You are, and will always be, incredibly self-possessed. Nothing happens to you that you have not already planned for. If anything, you would’ve preferred I arrived sooner. “So stubborn,” you will complain on multiple occasions, equal parts exasperated and fond, “you only do what you want.” Well, I am my mother’s daughter. Your long-awaited child will arrive in a matter of months. She will seem like a miracle to you, and you will treat her like one. I will resent this sometimes, especially as a teenager. I will feel suffocated by you, embarrassed by your relentless, never-ending ardour. Here in 2024, I think of it with a dizzying sense of relief. Everyone my age is trying new things and finding out who we are — the prospect of getting it wrong doesn’t scare me because I know that every version of me will be loved. How many people can say that? A year later, you’ll give birth again. Your husband will flee the room near tears because he cannot bear your pain. But you will bear it all, the way you’ve always done. I may never fully understand the person you are now and the decisions you made — but I know the person you will become. I know the nightly rituals that ease your busy mind: Throughout my childhood, you will touch the crucifix hanging on our closed apartment door, then come to both my sister and I as we’re on the edge of slumber, pressing cool fingers against our foreheads in benediction. On nights rest eludes you, you will make the trip twice more. You will only be able to rest when we do – and vice versa. I know your anxieties, your surprising sense of humour, your competitive spirit, your perfectionism, and your imperfections. I know no one has ever been more uniquely qualified to be my mother. How can I ever condescend to you? How can I question your intentions, your past and your choices — or lack thereof — when they have brought us all together and in such joy? We are both 25 years old. You are vitally maternal; I get nervous around pregnant women. You’re friendly where I’m withdrawn and taciturn, overly thoughtful where I’m careless. Still, we are two sides of the same coin. I want to ask you questions and listen to your answers without judgment. I want to know if you would like me if you didn’t have to; I want every version of you to be best friends with every version of me. I want to tell you that your love for me will become a foundational fact of my being; the immutable truth I will spend the next 25 years building my life around. I wonder if you know that most people go their entire lives without being as important to anyone as you are to me. Maybe in 1998, you’re laying your careworn palm on your stomach right now, and feeling the first flutterings of my existence. Here in 2024, I lay my head in your lap at the end of difficult days and drift off to sleep while your fingers card through my hair. I am safe and warm.

    "article_content": "Gen Z Speaks Unlike the typical Singaporean kid, I was homeschooled for almost all my educational journey since kindergarten. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, long-time homeschooler Arista Loh (above) had to enrol in a polytechnic in order to continue her studies. Here's why she doesn't regret her decision. This audio is AI-generated. Unlike the typical Singaporean kid, I was homeschooled for almost all my educational journey since kindergarten. My parents initially chose this path to provide me with a less stressful and more personalised educational experience compared to traditional schooling. Even though I had the option to transition to a conventional school after completing my PSLE exams, I remained committed to homeschooling. Homeschooling allowed me to enjoy studying while pursuing my hobbies, such as writing and reading. This unconventional approach not only made learning enjoyable during my growing years, but also instilled in me the discipline to manage my time effectively. Throughout my homeschooling years, I used relevant curriculum programmes from the United States, which has a more widely established homeschooling scene. I learnt through pre-recorded videos and remote grading by American teachers. Upon completing my Primary School Leaving Examinations in 2015, I felt ready to become more independent in my studies. But plans changed when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. My aspirations to attend university were put on hold when the College Board in the United States discontinued SAT subject tests globally due to the pandemic. I considered Advanced Placement exams, but the lack of prior exposure to relevant courses left me hesitant to continue pursuing self-studies. Having heard of other homeschoolers taking the polytechnic route to university instead, I decided to do so as well. As an avid writer and reader, human behaviour and psychology has always interested me. Thus, I chose to apply to Republic Polytechnic (RP) and secured a spot in the Diploma in Consumer Behaviour & Research course with the US high school diploma from my homeschooling programme. Transitioning from homeschooling to a polytechnic setting was initially daunting. Though my experience with co-curricular activities and supportive social circles had equipped me with essential communication skills throughout my homeschooling years, I’m still an introvert at heart. I was afraid of entering a new and unfamiliar environment, one where I would be learning alongside classmates. What if I wasn’t able to get along with them? Despite my initial apprehension, I was very excited to develop new friendships at polytechnic, even though I was not the most outgoing person. The pandemic had created some “pent-up social needs” in me, as the multiple extended lockdowns had prevented me from attending co-curricular activities and seeing friends in person. Instead of focusing on my worries, I set my sights on embracing opportunities to make new friends and catching up quickly in my learning pursuits. I told myself that I would try to be as friendly as possible to every classmate I met. I’ve always been pretty articulate and I had no problems speaking up in class, so I was able to perform well in class participation. That said, I was touched whenever my mentor in RP checked in to make sure that I was making friends and adapting well, and to answer my questions on IT matters and school fees. Despite the encouraging start, my polytechnic journey was not always smooth sailing. Even so, I tried to see each challenge as an opportunity for growth. Daily graded assignments were part of the grind, which I was not used to — while homeschooling, only tests, quizzes, and certain assignments had been graded. But my passion for writing proved extra helpful in staying on top of them. The rigorous demands of regular group projects and presentations allowed me to develop new levels of endurance, confidence, and effective communication skills. I particularly enjoyed modules on people and psychology as I’ve always been fascinated by how people think and how their thoughts affect their actions. Academics aside, poly life also offered me many other precious experiences and opportunities for broadening my horizons even further. In my third year, I got an internship opportunity at a leading market research company, NielsenIQ. Getting to learn more about people from the marketing perspective was so exciting, and I even got to participate in the conduct of real-world market research. The internship taught me more about how to communicate professionally and effectively with colleagues and to be more confident in my own abilities as I continued to grow my knowledge. After that, I had the opportunity to serve as a student leader on an international service learning trip to Batam, where we taught local kindergartners basic lessons in Mathematics, English, dance, and sports. During the trip, we had to improvise due to the language barrier. It was the first time I’d had the opportunity to reflect on how learning English can be a different experience for non-native speakers. This was a valuable experience that showed me how my skills and knowledge could be put towards making a positive impact on communities in need. All in all, as much as I had enjoyed homeschooling, it was fun to have classmates for once. The workload in RP could be tough at times, but working alongside friends made it more manageable. I graduated from RP on May 7, 2024. Looking back, my polytechnic experience turned out to be a transformative journey. Despite my initial concerns about the forced deviation from my original education plans, transiting to “normal” schooling had provided me with invaluable lessons, diverse experiences and meaningful connections. All of these have profoundly shaped my growth both as a student and as a person. The most impactful aspect of my experience at RP was the confidence I developed. It helped me not to fear changes and challenges, but to have faith in my own abilities. I also learnt how important companionship could be on a big journey like education. While homeschooling worked for me, it could also get pretty lonely at times as I didn’t have anyone to discuss my work or progress with. Being in RP was a good change for me, as I got to work alongside peers, and discuss and exchange ideas with them. It was nice to feel like I was part of a group. Post-graduation, I intend to pursue a degree in Linguistics, driven by my fascination with the intricacies of language. Whatever path I choose, I know that many more opportunities for growth await me.

Upon completing our final semester two months earlier, my batchmates and I felt that that we had “graduated at the worst possible time” amid a raging Covid-19 pandemic. Gen Z Speaks writer Nur Qasrina Iskandar Lim, 27, who does clinical research at the National University Hospital. She began her career during the Covid-19 pandemic years after graduating with a degree in life science in June 2020. This audio is AI-generated. I graduated with a degree in life science in June 2020. Upon completing our final semester two months earlier, my batchmates and I felt that that we had “graduated at the worst possible time” amid a raging Covid-19 pandemic. When we looked for encouragement from others around us — our parents and our seniors, for example — they too painted a pretty bleak picture. Despite the widespread cynicism, I remained optimistic and went for my first few job interviews with hopeful anticipation. However, my optimism was soon dulled by a series of rejections, before responses dried up altogether. After applying to over 40 jobs to no avail, my job search was turning into a fruitless journey to nowhere. As my friends started securing job offers, we would have online get-togethers to celebrate. I made sure to keep a smile and congratulate their success. But deep down, I had doubts and fears about the uncertainty of my own career. I understood that everyone has their own struggles, and could not help wondering: “When will it be my turn? Am I not good enough?” Soon, these thoughts morphed into growing pressure to meet expectations. Whenever my parents asked about my job search out of concern, I would deflect with a vague, brief response like: \"Yes, finding” to avoid seeing their faces fall with disappointment. I decided to take on a temporary job at a supermarket chain in May 2020 where I was tasked to man the temperature-taking and TraceTogether stations as well as handle inventory stock. While working in the supermarket, I met people from all walks of life and observed how the pandemic disrupted and affected their lives. This reminded me of the drive I had during my undergraduate days and my desire to help people. Eventually, I embarked on a nine-month SGUnited Traineeship Programme at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), where I was part of a research team that was designing a novel ART kit to detect Covid-19 infection. At the time, I supported the team by running experiments to determine the accuracy of the kit. Like my stint working in the supermarket, this had not been in my original plans. But while I continued with my job search, working in a lab setting allowed me to strengthen my skills in conducting scientific research and data analysis. In 2021, I saw a job opening posted by an acquaintance on LinkedIn for a clinical research coordinator role at the National University Hospital. While it was not a profession I was familiar with, it was a research-related role that opened a new area of possibility for my career. After months of dismay, I did not dare set any expectations or raise my hopes even though I secured an interview. Imagine my surprise and relief when, after several weeks, I got a call-back — and then, finally, a job offer! When I started work in May 2021, the hospitals were still stretched thin by the ongoing pandemic. My first two weeks of training and orientation were a delicate balancing act of learning the ropes of my new role while also stepping up to fill urgent gaps. It was overwhelming at first as I had no idea what to expect each day. Before this job, I’d felt drawn to healthcare research because I thought I could make a difference for patients, but I soon found that facing the reality on the ground was a test of resilience. One of my first tasks was to approach clinic patients to participate in a research survey, but I was again faced with waves of rejection. Putting my discouragement aside, I consulted senior colleagues for advice and got helpful tips such as first building rapport with nurses. The more I interacted with patients, the more I realised how much my earlier stint at the supermarket had helped me to develop a more mature and resilient mindset. It prepared me to walk the tricky tightrope of addressing patients’ anxieties and handling instances of frustration and unintentional harshness with care and empathy. Some patients would break down under the stresses of their difficult health journeys. It took me a while, but I now understand that most of the time, these patients are not seeking solutions but rather a safe space to share and release pent-up emotions. Most people are comforted just to know that someone is willing to listen and care. Over the past year, I have been managing a dermatology research study on the care experience of over 1,000 patients being treated for chronic eczema and psoriasis. My job requires me to multi-task — from checking patient recruitment and research data documents to obtaining regulatory approval and honing my communication skills with stakeholders. Thankfully, I found the skills I’d picked up in my part-time gigs coming in handy yet again. These include planning my time effectively, which made the steep learning curve easier to tackle. Our hard work paid off when findings from the study were published in the reputable journal JAMA Dermatology last year. In March, I even got the chance to present our research findings at a dermatology conference in San Diego, United States. The unexpected honour made me think back to where I was just a few years ago, feeling trapped and despondent in the face of stagnation. From over 40 job rejections to now being picked to represent my work organisation overseas in a big conference — I could hardly believe how far I’ve come in such a short time. Four years ago, the phrase “things will get better” uttered by well-meaning peers and family felt, at times, empty and cursory amid the struggles I faced. But I’m glad that I never gave up. This year, I received the Distinguished Contributor Award for clinical research coordinators, an award given out by the Singapore Clinical Research Institute. Being on stage alongside other awardees who are much more experienced veterans, I felt small, but also immensely grateful for this affirmation early in my career. While I still have a considerable way to go, I find myself more determined than ever to give my best in the years ahead. I am now pursuing a Master’s degree in Public Health at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. These days, when my friends and I meet up in person, we sometimes look back together on the various difficulties we pushed through in the pandemic. While each of our original plans may have been diverted or even derailed, we refuse to be disheartened. To youths facing similar struggles now: Stay open to unexpected opportunities. Each setback is a stepping stone to grow and to build experience, skills and resilience for what’s to come. With determination and a little luck, each one of us will find ourselves on the right path for us, even if it’s not the one we’d originally planned for ourselves.

    "article_content": "Commentary Multiculturalism is largely celebrated in Singapore as a cornerstone of our society. However, discrimination still rears its ugly head from time to time, often in ways we may not even be aware of. Multiculturalism is largely celebrated as a cornerstone of Singapore. However, discrimination still rears its ugly head from time to time. This audio is AI-generated. Here in Singapore, subtle forms of discrimination still abound in day-to-day conversations and colloquialisms — not because of malicious intent, but because of thoughtlessness, explains a communications strategist. Multiculturalism is largely celebrated in Singapore as a cornerstone of our society. However, discrimination still rears its ugly head from time to time, often in ways we may not even be aware of. On March 15, reports emerged of a photo shared on social media by a Singapore Armed Forces serviceman showing the user participating in military training with his peers. In his post, the serviceman used a caption that contained a derogatory racial term. While the Ministry of Defence was swift to condemn the act, the damage was already done — netizens took to online platforms to criticise the boys for their insensitivity. But some others were dismissive of or confused about the perceived “discrimination”, not understanding why the servicemen’s actions were harmful at all. I was recently at a client meeting where the conversation shifted into a mix of English and Mandarin, primarily from the Mandarin speakers in the room, who made up the majority. Being Chinese, I could follow along just fine — but I could clearly see how it was a struggle for colleagues in the minority, left scrambling to play catch-up in an already fast-paced discussion. Like many other cosmopolitan cities, Singapore is a melting pot of differing cultures, languages and ethnicities. However, in any such pot, the reality is that the dominant culture often takes precedence. Oftentimes, this dominance isn’t active or overt, nor is it forcefully enacted. Rather, it’s most commonly expressed in thoughtlessness — and this shows itself to be true even in everyday conversations and colloquialisms. We’ve likely witnessed or been part of similar occurrences in our everyday interactions, where dialect phrases and other non-English streams of speech are naturally slipped in without consideration of the other parties present. Another common example of inadvertent offence is backhanded compliments, where positive statements are followed up with discriminatory caveats: “You’re pretty for someone of your race”, for example, or “You’re smart compared to most women”. Such caveats imply that the quality being praised is unusual for someone by virtue of their race or gender. This both undermines them and reinforces negative stereotypes, and those on the receiving end often end up feeling invalidated or inferior. A 2022 joint survey by the Association of Women for Action and Research and Milieu Insight polled 1,000 respondents — nationally representative by age, gender and race — and found that in the past five years, around half of Singaporeans have experienced workplace discrimination. More serious forms of discrimination encompass unfair company policies and discriminatory employment practices related to career progression, including performance appraisals and promotion. For instance, individuals may receive a poorer performance appraisal after disclosing pregnancy, disability, or health conditions. While subtle forms of discrimination might be done without malicious intent, it can pose a significant problem if left unchecked. In the case of speaking in a different language, nuances and subtleties vital for understanding and relationship-building in and out of the workplace risk being lost in translation, leaving those in the minority feeling excluded or disadvantaged, both professionally and socially. Jonathan Kuek, a mental health researcher at Total Wellness Initiative Singapore, emphasises the “profound impact” on one’s mental well-being: “Such ostracism may trigger a range of emotions, from anger to anxiety to depression, and could leave individuals feeling worthless and lacking confidence in themselves.” Our language choices also have the power to enforce unfair gender dynamics. During a discussion of an event’s dress code, a client’s male colleagues joked about turning up in their “birthday suit”. While this was met with scattered laughter, the meeting’s female participants’ chuckles seemed comparatively strained. Some exchanged uneasy glances. In incidents such as these, women often feel pressured to refrain from voicing their discomfort, or even to adapt and adjust. McKinsey's 2023 Women in the Workplace report reveals that 78 per cent of women facing microaggressions at work engage in self-protective behaviours, such as modifying their speech or behaviour, in an attempt to blend in and forestall negative reactions. This practice is called “code-switching”, explains psychologist Beverly Tatum — adjusting one’s appearance or behaviour to match perceived environmental expectations. Doing so is a means of finding common ground in environments that promote assimilation, but can be detrimental if it requires sacrificing one's identity, cautions Dr Tatum. The brunt of this pressure to blend in falls disproportionately onto women and other minorities. It can be as small as changing your given name in order to assimilate into places where the majority of people don’t bother saying it right. Linguistic microaggressions such as these aren't isolated incidents, but commonplace experiences for minorities. They are not merely surface-level issues; they’re symptomatic of a deeper struggle for inclusion and belonging. Simply put: We’re stifling voices not by silencing them, but by being inconsiderate. We must take proactive steps to educate ourselves and others to identify the subtle ways our language, jokes, and word choices can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and affect marginalised individuals and groups. It's as easy as extending basic courtesy to those in the room — for instance, it doesn’t hurt to explain why we're using a certain language or to avoid using it altogether if some people won't understand. Bad behaviour should always be called out. However, this does not mean enforcing “cancel culture” or aggressively blasting the person to their face or on public platforms such as social media. Instead, \"calling in\" may be more effective, suggests Roses of Peace’s Mohamed Irshad. This means connecting with the person making such remarks in an empathetic manner: “Hey, I know you didn’t mean any harm in what you said earlier, but it made me uncomfortable. Can we talk about it?” If we find ourselves witnessing microaggressions such as these, we should not remain silent bystanders. Speak up more to redress the disparity and damage, especially when minorities may risk their well-being and safety by speaking up for themselves. In ongoing discussions about Singapore's future, it’s clear that we as a society are making strides to become a more inclusive society. However, we still have holistic work to do in many areas. Creating a culture of mutual respect starts with us ensuring that, in whatever rooms and conversations we’re in, all voices are equally heard.

    "article_content": "Commentary Last week, a conversation between a private-hire driver and his passenger set off a storm of debate on acceptable behaviour between drivers and their customers. This audio is AI-generated. People can't seem to agree on whether the passenger's request was an overstepping of customer bounds or not. But even so, the job of a private-hire driver is to render a service to customers. This TODAY senior journalist asks: When it comes to customer service, is basic courtesy not one of the most essential things? Last week, a conversation between a private-hire driver and his passenger set off a storm of debate on acceptable behaviour between drivers and their customers. In the shared screenshot, the passenger requested that the driver drive up to the sixth-floor carpark of their pick-up venue without specifying why. Then the conversation shifted gears with the driver’s reply: “U handicapped uh?? Go up lvl extra $5 wrong pick up.” The passenger promptly yielded and said they would head down to the pick-up spot. End of conversation? Not quite. “Don’t be self entitle,” tacked on the driver. “We r not your personal driver.” The incident revved up heated responses from the public, which were largely split into two opposing sides: Those who agreed with the driver and found satisfaction in his response, and those who said the passenger was not wrong to ask and that the driver could have worded his reply more politely. It’s clear that many in the first camp of opinion are themselves aggrieved private-hire drivers who have met their fair share of demanding passengers. A few comments pointed out that the driver was simply expressing the voices of his peers. Passengers these days are only getting more demanding, and their requests are more unreasonable, they griped. Riders should follow the pick-up rules, they chastised, and stop pushing your luck with overtaxed drivers to go the extra mile for you. Perhaps they do have a point. After all, there have been several instances of out-of-pocket requests from ride-hailing passengers, such as taking a detour to avoid ERP charges, that have made the news. Keeping in mind that publicised incidents such as these are likely just the tip of the iceberg, private-hire drivers in Singapore have good reason to be wary of passengers when they demand something out of the ordinary. Members of the public who sided with the passenger stressed that it was not wrong for the passenger to make an auxiliary request, especially if it was already put forth early on during the booking process. Not everyone could agree on whether the passenger’s request was overstepping reasonable bounds or not — but even so, many disapproved of the driver’s tone as unnecessarily “rude”. If he didn’t want to accommodate the request, he could have simply declined firmly but “nicely”, they said. When it comes to understanding each other, it seems like the driver and passenger in this incident were on different lanes. So who’s at fault? On one hand, it’s true that some ride-hailing customers have gotten too used to taking a mile when drivers give them an inch. But then again, is it fair to let a few rotten apples spoil the entire barrel? In the case of this incident, does the driver’s past experiences with vexing passengers warrant such aggressive treatment of all his future customers? Private-hire drivers, like any other service providers, are being hired to render a service to customers. And when it comes to customer service, is basic courtesy not one of the most essential things? However, passengers also need to keep in mind that while private-hire drivers offer us convenience and comfort, they are not at our beck and call. We are customers on the benefiting end of a purchased service. The onus is on us to head to the pick-up point stated in the booking — because that is the agreement we’ve made in purchasing the service. Of course, sometimes we need a little extra help from our day-to-day service providers. Perhaps we’re dealing with an injury, or are travelling with a person whose mobility is significantly limited or impaired (an elderly relative, for example). In such cases, it would be best to explain to the driver, clearly and politely, the need for a special request outside the standard parameters of the booking. That being said, bear in mind that drivers have the right to decline such requests. In response to queries from TODAY, Grab confirmed that customers are automatically charged extra fees for changes in drop-off locations, but not pick-up, as users are unable to change their pick-up locations once they have booked a ride. Gojek stated that their app allows riders to change their pick-up location even after they’ve been matched with a driver with no additional fees, as long as the new location is within 200 metres from the original pick-up point and before the driver has reached the original pick-up location. It’s not clear which ride-hailing platform this driver was operating on. However, this incident — like the ongoing debate on whether drivers should help passengers with their luggage — is yet another spotlight on the grey areas that remain in the modern age of ride-hailing services. What does “customer service” mean when drivers are no longer directly employed by a company? Does it still matter, or has the proliferation of app-based service purchases rendered such exchanges purely “business”, with no room left for human sentiment? Is it reasonable for drivers to overfocus on the financial benefit in their interactions with customers? Is it acceptable for passengers to put the squeeze on drivers in an attempt to get the most bang for their buck? Until we have the answers to these questions, this incident drives home the point that politeness is not just free, but priceless. Either way, it’s probably safe to say that this particular driver won’t be getting five stars. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Amanda Yeap is a senior journalist at TODAY who wishes we could all be a little more empathetic and kinder to one another. CLARIFICATION: Grab has clarified that for changes in drop-off locations made by the customer after booking a ride, the additional charge is automatically reflected in the app. As for changes in pick-up locations, drivers are not allowed to ask for any additional charges, but they have the right to decline requests if they are unable to fulfill them.

    "article_content": "Commentary Sleeping with your dog in the same room could be negatively affecting your sleep quality. New research suggests that most people are unaware of the potential negative effects their pets may have on their sleep. This audio is AI-generated. Even though pets may have an overall positive effect on mental health, it is possible that some of this benefit may be undermined if they are also causing you to lose sleep at night, says this assistant professor of psychology. Sleeping with your dog in the same room could be negatively affecting your sleep quality, according to my team’s recently published research in Scientific Reports. We recruited a nationally representative sample of more than 1,500 American adults who completed questionnaires assessing their sleep habits. Overall, about half of the participants reported co-sleeping with pets — defined in our study as sleeping in the same room with your pet for at least part of the night. Next, our research team compared the sleep habits of people who did and didn’t co-sleep with pets. Our analyses revealed that participants who co-slept with pets had poorer sleep quality and more insomnia symptoms than those who did not. These findings persisted even after accounting for demographic differences between these groups. When considering pet type, we found evidence for a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with dogs but no evidence for a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with cats. Surprisingly, 93 per cent of people in our study who co-slept with their pets believed that their pets had either a positive or neutral overall effect on their sleep. Although more research is needed, these findings could suggest that most people are unaware of the potential negative effects their pets may have on their sleep. Most pet owners report that their pets have a generally positive effect on their mental health. Pets can improve their owners’ health in numerous ways during the day, such as by encouraging physical activity, promoting a daily routine and providing love and companionship. However, our study fills an important knowledge gap by indicating that co-sleeping with pets can affect sleep quality. Good sleep is a pillar of health and wellness. Even though pets may have an overall positive effect on mental health, it is possible that some of this benefit may be undermined if they are also causing you to lose sleep at night. Although some people report that co-sleeping with their pets can provide them with a sense of comfort or intimacy, it is important for people sharing a bedroom with their pets to be aware of their potential to serve as a source of nighttime noise, heat or movement that can disrupt your ability to fall or stay asleep. Survey-based studies like ours are unable to prove that co-sleeping with pets causes disrupted sleep, although there is some evidence suggesting that this could be the case. One important factor that our study did not assess was whether participants were also co-sleeping with other people like a spouse or child. Previous research suggests that sharing a bed with other people can also affect our sleep and that the mental health benefits of pet ownership could be stronger for people with a romantic partner. It probably isn’t realistic for most people to just stop co-sleeping with their pets. So, what should someone do to improve their sleep if they already share a bed with their pets? Some expert tips include choosing a mattress that is large enough for you and your pets, washing and changing your bedding regularly, and establishing and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine with your pets. Further research is needed to identify more specific habits and routines that pet owners can adopt to ensure a good night’s sleep when sharing the bedroom with their pets.

    "article_content": "Commentary When are Singaporeans at their most patriotic? No, not on the 9th of August. It’s anytime a non-Singaporean has the gall to make a bad comment about our country. A travel vlogger recently called Singapore \"boring\". What was it about this one particular post that quickly became the talk of the town? This audio is AI-generated. In a sea of hot takes across the world wide web, what was it exactly about travel vlogger Nina Gerhards' that quickly became the talk of the town? A TODAY journalist puts forth this theory: It’s because when it comes to opinions about Singapore, we all care very much, whether we care to admit it or not. When are Singaporeans at their most patriotic? No, not on the 9th of August. It’s anytime a non-Singaporean has the gall to make a bad comment about our country. Recently, a travel vlogger named Nina Gerhards posted an Instagram reel lamenting that our precious clean, green city-state was boring, and that she would never travel here again. Ms Gerhards’ video clocked in at barely three seconds in length, and she didn’t speak a word in it. Instead, she offered only a caption of slightly under 100 words (and eight #hashtags) as elaboration, before inviting her fellow netizens to join her in the comments for a good-natured discussion: “What do you think about Singapore?” Boy, did we take her up on that offer. In a matter of days, the video racked up more than two million views and hundreds of comments — the most ‘liked’ of which was a cordial smattering of unpublishable expletives, coupled with a polite suggestion that she shouldn’t have come in the first place. Clearly, our collective buttons had been pushed. Many Singaporeans leapt to defend our Little Red Dot with long, elaborate essays on the country’s merits (i.e., we’re safe and it’s easy to get around), and recommendations on where she could go to turn her unfavourable opinion on its head (i.e., anywhere but the well-trodden tourist spots). Some in the same camp voiced their displeasure with far less tact and far fewer words. With Singapore being an island almost 500 times smaller than our immediate neighbours, they derided, was she expecting mountains, rivers, and sprawling wildlife amidst vast green plains? On the flip side, there was a substantial number of people who agreed with the vlogger. Singapore is boring, they declared. Singapore is expensive. Singapore is a lifeless concrete jungle. It’s a country not too dissimilar to the image of a rich man’s soulless playground depicted in Hollywood flicks like Crazy Rich Asians, they said — that’s why so many of us eagerly await the holidays and our own travel adventures to escape the mundanity of a society that prioritises work over fun. While I understood both points of view, I couldn’t help but wonder why this seemingly innocuous post managed to spark such heavy and heated reactions. As far as I can tell, Ms Gerhards wasn’t being nasty or disrespectful, nor was she deliberately trying to incite a riot (although whether the post was designed as clickbait is another matter). She merely cited an opinion — and we see far more controversial and arguably crappy ones on the Internet every day. “Singapore is boring”: Haven’t we heard that before? Perhaps the most grievous accusation the vlogger made that both camps wouldn’t have been happy with was that our food “wasn’t even delicious”. But even then, going off her social media pages, Ms Gerhards is German. Someone born and raised on the other side of the globe having a different cuisine preference is hardly a cardinal sin. So, in a sea of hot takes across the world wide web, what was it exactly about this one that quickly became the talk of the town? I think the answer has been staring us straight in the face: It’s because when it comes to opinions about Singapore, we all care very much, whether we care to admit it or not. Whether you think “Singapore’s great” or you’re firmly on team “Singapore sucks”, we inherently and instinctively know more about our country than a visitor on a three-day visa does. The post going viral in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The fact that so many of us jumped so heartily into the fray — either to highlight our strengths or to point out our weaknesses — just means we’re passionate. What I do find problematic is lack of civility in the town square of public reactions. When we resort to pointed personal attacks, does that not only serve to drive home the message that we are not a welcoming bunch? What does it say about us when our hostility — not always so thinly veiled — results in her feeling a need to turn off her comments section? I get it: When you put any hint of an opinion out on the Internet, you should expect to get flamed, cancelled, and everything in between. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. But when it comes to a post talking explicitly about Singapore and its merits and demerits, do we really want to perpetuate a culture of reactionary resentment? The urge to rush to defend that which we love is only human nature. But in an era where opinions on social media sprout up more frequently and randomly than pimples on teenagers, perhaps it’s wise to leave some be, rather than poke at every single one.

    "article_content": "Commentary When people consume news and current affairs, it’s hard to escape tragic events, from natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and events that include loss of human life. But do we stop to consider what such media is doing to our kids? Research finds that young children who are exposed to news and current affair programmes can be affected so much that they start viewing the world as a scarier place. This audio is AI-generated. There is no magic timeframe for parents to introduce their children to news and current affairs, says this early childhood education expert — however, it is important that we consider not just the age, but the maturity and understanding levels of the individual child. While much attention has been drawn to the detrimental impact of violent video games on children’s developing brains, there has been relatively little discussion regarding the negative effects of news and current-affair programmes children are exposed to. When people consume news and current affairs, it’s hard to escape tragic events, from natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and events that include loss of human life. But do we stop to consider what distressing media is doing to our kids? Research undertaken by the Audience Research Department of the Netherlands Broadcasting Corporation found young children who are exposed to news and current affair programmes can be affected so much that they start viewing the world as a scarier place . Research was undertaken through random telephone interviews with 537 Dutch children, with 48.2 per cent of respondents stating they had a fear reaction to watching adult news. The study found children aged between 7-12 were most afraid of interpersonal violence and natural disasters such as fires, accidents and other disasters. Researchers from the study even found children’s symptoms are like a trauma response — including intruding thoughts (memories that pop into a child’s head, nightmares, repeated discussion around events), avoidance (refusal to talk about news events, or to participate in school activities) and changes to arousal and reactivity (increased irritability and anger outbursts, difficulties in concentrating). Even when children are playing in the background, if adults have the news on, children can be listening in. Children under the age of seven might not understand the content, which can cause confusion, therefore raising worry and anxiety. This is because children under the age of seven do not have the brain function to mentally manipulate information, and can’t see things from another point of view. Older teens, meanwhile, generally gain much of their news content from the Internet and social media, meaning some parents are not aware of how much, or what, they are exposed to. However, due to their age, they are able to have a greater understanding of different perspectives. According to psychological therapist Annie Gurton, different age groups require different strategies when it comes to consuming news and current affairs: Children under the age of seven may perceive televised events as live occurrences, leading them to believe traumatic incidents are recurring when they see repeated broadcasts. They are likely to be greatly disturbed by images depicting suffering, crying, or violence. Between seven to 12, children tend to grasp that news reports convey events that have already taken place. They are increasingly capable of empathising with victims, and may get anxious about the safety of themselves and their family when encountering distressing stories. Teenagers aged 13 and older tend to exhibit heightened emotional responses to distressing events, often experiencing fear and deep concern for their and their family’s safety. They may project such events into the future and worry about potential risks. However, they are also capable of reasoning and understanding statistical explanations, which can provide reassurance and alleviate their anxieties. There is no magic timeframe for parents to introduce their children to news and current affairs, however it is important that we consider not just the age, but the maturity and understanding levels of the individual child. However, we do know it’s important for children to take a break from the coverage. Setting a viewing limit of 30-60 minutes before encouraging children to get up and do something else is important. A perfect opportunity to support children to know more about the world, without exposing them to the potential downside of the news, is to teach them about why you need to censor their viewing. This can help teach children to regulate their emotions, by expressing themselves when they see things that are upsetting. This might include empathising with young children under the age of seven by saying something like: “I know you really want to watch the news, but some media can report events that are not safe for you to hear.” For an older child, it could be: “I am happy for you to watch the ‘good news’ stories but other events that are televised we need to watch together.” The Raising Children Network, an Australian government-funded parenting website, has some fantastic tips for parents of school-age children when it comes to distressing news events: 1. Turn off and take a break This might mean allowing families 30 minutes to catch up on the main headlines, but then getting up and doing something else. 2. Age-appropriate information Children will cope better if they have age-appropriate information given to them. For example, during fire season in Australia, Australian parents might talk to their children about how due to the extreme heat, the ground gets very dry, resulting in an increase of fires. This is why there are total fire ban days to reduce that risk. 3. Talk to your children Explain, at an age-appropriate level, what they have watched and allow for open communication about what has happened. Allow them to ask questions and reflect. 4. Monitor your children’s reactions to the news Ask them how they’re feeling and share how you’re feeling.

    "article_content": "Commentary A growing cohort of TikTok influencers are promoting passive income to their followers, sharing their expertise, tips and advice for how their followers can, theoretically, achieve the same without lifting a finger. Many influencers pushing passive income schemes describe it as a way to \"earn while you sleep\", suggesting that once you put in the initial work on a certain generating enterprise, it will essentially make money for you. This audio is AI-generated. Amid unprecedented levels of income inequality, there is a growing recognition among workers of the uncertainty of the labour market and the need to think differently about financial security — but passive income might not be all it’s cracked up to be, warns this PhD candidate. A growing cohort of TikTok influencers have begun building platforms by promoting passive income to their followers. Thousands of users regularly share their expertise, tips and advice for how their followers can, theoretically, achieve the same level of passive income without lifting a finger. One influencer claimed to have tried \"about every side hustle that exists\" before landing on print-on-demand as the most profitable source of passive income, which she says makes her \"six figures as a teenager\". During the Covid-19 pandemic, interest in passive income surged. The passive income subreddit has nearly half a million members and the #passiveincome hashtag on TikTok has 1.2 million posts and billions of views. In the wake of the pandemic ending, many have lost faith in the labour market, believing it to have reached a point of no return. Given the current state of the economy and governmental policy, it’s unsurprising that so many are lured by the appeal of passive income. The middle and working classes have seen the same opportunities afforded to their parents and grandparents evaporate, leaving them dreaming of financial stability without the means to achieve it. Amid unprecedented levels of income inequality, there is a growing recognition among workers of the uncertainty of the labour market and the need to think differently about financial security. But passive income might not be all it’s cracked up to be. According to a 2022 survey in the United States, a significant portion of Gen Z get their financial advice from either TikTok (34 per cent) or YouTube (33 per cent). They see influencers sharing their successes (and very rarely their failures) and are motivated to try their strategies out for themselves. Various passive income subcultures have emerged, from finance bro hustle gurus to young women peddling money-making credit card schemes to their followers. Many influencers pushing passive income schemes describe it as a way to \"earn while you sleep\", suggesting that once you put in the initial work on a certain generating enterprise, it will essentially make money for you. As research I conducted with sociologist Karen Gregory has shown, this has been further literalised by livestreamers on platforms like Twitch. These streamers draw in more viewers and attention by livestreaming themselves sleeping, as fans donate money, promote their content and buy emojis or other perks throughout the broadcast. This signals a desire to be \"freed from work\", because \"to sleep on stream is to put aside and obscure the preparatory work that goes into it and benefit from the market through complete bodily passivity\". For us, then, these sleep streamers seem to embody the logical endpoint of passive income as the ultimate dream of this moment under digital capitalism. The idea of passive income is often glamourised, but the reality is that many of these ventures require significant effort. In many cases, the work that goes into side hustles or alternative income streams is incredibly laborious, from handling the logistics and costs of dropshipping (the purchasing of cheap goods to re-sell them at a profit) to the creation and selling of online courses about making passive income. Indeed, the understanding of what passive income is has transformed wildly, from what the US Internal Revenue Service describes as \"activities in which you don’t materially participate\" to re-appropriating terms like \"leveraged income\" to refer to maintaining Airbnb rental properties as being somehow passive. While many critics have correctly pointed out the false promises that permeate the financial wisdom within these online subcultures, we must carefully consider the cultural and economic forces underwriting this shift. Some of it is surely good old-fashioned aspirational content and marketing, as journalist Rebecca Jennings wrote in a March 2023 article for Vox. “In short,” she wrote, “it’s the feeling that our primary aim as people is to make our lives as effective and efficient as possible.” In other words, the “always be grinding” mindset. As a result, the concept of participating in multiple income streams to protect one’s self from financial vulnerability is re-framed as not only strategic but passive. Sure, you can break up your labour into different entrepreneurial paths, but you can also, ideally, start them up and then let them go without much maintenance. Let the money flow. Get-rich-quick schemes are nothing new, and the ones currently being shared by “finfluencers” are typically rife with pitfalls, from a complete lack of regulation or accountability, to blurring lines between regular social media content and advertisements — not to mention the way users are expected to take influencers at their word for how much they make through passive income. Only 20 per cent of Americans make passive income, and almost entirely via dividends, interest or rental properties (although whether rental properties count as truly passive income is still up for debate). Canadian numbers are harder to come by, but Finance Canada estimated 83 per cent of taxable passive income was held by individuals in the top 1 per cent income range in 2017. This makes sense. The classic Wall Street notion of passive income — investing in the right stocks or index funds or owning property and having the rental checks prop up your livelihood — persists. Nevertheless, in a new gilded age defined and structured by wealth that is passively inherited or transferred and rarely distributed, the rest of us can’t help but take notice of a platform economy waiting to be exploited — and why not? The belief that one’s self worth is their net worth turns us all into enterprising would-be success stories, grabbing at a way to monetise what we can, while we can. For many, this means racing to seize opportunities before they vanish.

    "article_content": "Commentary When BreadTalk, the makers of chicken floss buns, decided to slap a 10 cent charge on each disposable carrier bag from April 1, many Singaporeans cried \"fowl\" at the hypocrisy of the move. Companies making moves to charge consumers for plastic carrier bags are being accused of attempting to price-gouge everyday Singaporeans by charging them for plastic carrier bags, but what are we missing in our rush to rage out against them? This audio is AI-generated. Carrier charges from the likes of BreadTalk and Skechers have Singaporeans up in arms about unfair burdens and greenwashing concerns. But what this shows about us is that despite recent progress, says a TODAY editor, we still have a long way to go when it comes to environmentalism. “Save the Earth, kindly bring your own flask/container”, read a laminated sign at a drinks stall that I frequent near my workplace. Plastered next to it was a handwritten line of text devoid of the same politeness in the sign, and seemed to be added almost as an afterthought: “Takeaway plastic cup plus 20 cents.” I duly paid for the levy to go with my kopi, which came with an added bitterness of having forgotten to bring along my reusable mug. It’s a 15 per cent markup — but hey, at least I have coffee. Ever since Singapore launched the mandatory disposable bag charge for most supermarkets last year, I have perhaps been conditioned to accept that there is a cost to leaving my foldable tote bag or thermos flask at home. Yet, if you’ve been on the Internet in recent months, you might think that my reaction was unjustifiably mild. When BreadTalk, the makers of chicken floss buns, decided to slap a 10 cent charge on each disposable carrier bag from April 1, many Singaporeans were predictably outraged . Noting that this applies to the large plastic bags used to carry a collective basket of buns, and not the individual plastic wraps that keep the chicken floss from flying everywhere, people cried “fowl” at the hypocrisy of the move. Many accused these of being moves to price-gouge everyday Singaporeans, as though all of us are innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire between consumerism and environmentalism. It then emerged that American shoe company Skechers also decided to slap a 50 cent charge for canvas bags, after one netizen posted a picture of a receipt with the purported charge claiming that she wasn’t informed beforehand. The company later clarified that the customer was, in fact, aware of the additional charge before payment, and had the closed-circuit television footage to prove it. But the proverbial horse had bolted by then and the criticism against the two companies came fast and furious. “Daylight robbery,” said the original poster who first flagged the Skechers episode on a Facebook group for complaints. “Cheapskate company,” said another. Profiteering claims aside, several wondered if Singapore's government-sanctioned mandatory bag charge in supermarkets gave all businesses a blank-cheque opportunity to essentially raise prices. Why can’t the company cover the costs, asked one person? Is it “greenwashing” when consumers are the ones shouldering the price of businesses’ own green initiatives? On the other hand, there was another camp of commentators that agreed with the rationale for charging for disposable bags, but differed on how it is implemented. A few wanted to go further in trying to end single-use plastics, suggesting that companies incentivise those who bring their own containers by offering them with discounts. A few also wanted the plastic bag fees to go to green causes. Heck, just ban plastic packaging completely, they said — even the smaller ones used to wrap individual pieces of fruit or bread. But this group of netizens also pointed out how the naysayers of carrier bag charges tend to forget that it is a choice whether or not to pay the fee. It’s a plain fact that most of the concerns flagged about the mandatory carrier bag charge are solved when the individual has a personal food container or a carrier bag on hand. Of course, bringing along a bag with you everyday is something that requires a habitual change — which comes back to why a mandatory bag charge is adopted for supermarkets in the first place. It is, practically speaking, a policy designed to gently prod consumers towards opting for reusable bags and to get them thinking about the plastic waste that they are generating. Earlier this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu told Parliament that large supermarket operators have observed around a 50 per cent to 80 per cent drop in the number of disposable carrier bags used by consumers since the minimum charge came into force on July 3, 2023. What the outrage over BreadTalk and Skechers demonstrates is that despite recent progress, the nationwide endeavour to shift habits and inculcate a mindset of reducing one’s environmental footprint is still in its infancy. Beyond BreadTalk and Skechers, there will be more retail as well as food and beverage outlets that will implement such moves. If that is the case, and if our collective and instinctive reaction is to continue to blame others instead of trying to relook at one’s own habits, then we still have a long way to go. Reading between the lines of the consumer outcry, it’s also clear that fears over corporate greenwashing are driving this lack of belief in the global goal of cutting waste. It causes people to suspect the motives behind such initiatives instead of questioning their own role in these efforts. This is why at the end of the day, businesses should ensure that any carrier bag charges they impose must primarily function as designed: A nudge to consumer behaviour, instead of a flat charge on any plastic use. For instances where people can't be realistically expected to use their own bags for reasons like hygiene, the charge shouldn’t exist, because there is nothing to nudge them towards. When buying a greasy burger at a food stand, for example, it is unfair to expect people to pay for the takeout box. It may not be feasible for people to bring their own food containers, either. How many people leave the house in the morning already knowing what they will be eating that day? But businesses that disregard these and charge for packaging under the guise of green causes will quickly learn that there will be pushback. Ultimately, any business that forces customers to pay for plastic packaging is a net loss for the environment as well as the customer’s pocket. People are free to take their business elsewhere after all. Just don’t be too quick to bag on the idea of plastic bag charges just yet.

    "article_content": "Commentary See the word “musician” on a resume and you might not immediately think “stellar employee” or “exceptional leader”. But is there more to the profession than meets the stereotype? New research shows that music education and experience lays the foundation for high levels of future aptitude in a range of workplaces. This audio is AI-generated. New research finds that music experience equips workers with a strong work ethic, willingness to learn, and the ability to take the initiative, says this senior lecturer in arts education. See the word “musician” on a resume and you might not immediately think “stellar employee” or “exceptional leader”. Perhaps the word evokes the image of a rock star, in trouble for chucking a television out of a hotel room window. Or else someone struggling along in life, who should have picked a “real job”. But is there more to the profession than meets the stereotype? It is well known many musicians work simultaneously in arts and non-arts roles, often to create some income security. Less understood is just how well the extensive skillset developed in music transfers to a non-arts, professional workplace. My nationwide survey sought to find out. I began by conducting 15 in-depth interviews with musicians simultaneously working dual-careers — one in music, and one somewhere else. The preliminary findings, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, showed dual-career musicians have a plethora of distinctive workplace skills that had been enabled by their musical education and experience. This was verified by their non-musician co-workers. The discovery sparked an ongoing second stage of research, investigating the experience of a larger group. These include: With 165 respondents so far, the emerging results are significant: Music education and experience lays the foundation for high levels of future aptitude in a range of workplaces. One of the most powerful traits instilled by a music education is a deep sense of professionalism. Eighty-five per cent of survey participants identified the trait as the skill that most influenced expectations of themselves and others, and the quality of their work. A common industry saying about rehearsal reflects this attitude of consistency and punctuality — “early is on time, on time is late, and late is left behind.” Other notable skills included autonomy and self-direction, resilience and perseverance, and creativity. Participants attributed the development of these strengths to the disciplined and focused attention required to learn music, and the intrinsic motivation needed to practise and perfect an instrument over a long period of time. This is increasingly relevant in an age where screens and social media steal our concentration and cost employers’ productivity. Another key trait identified was creativity, which may reflect findings that the musically trained have more neuronal matter, and therefore increased brain activity. Interviews with non-musician colleagues showed that out-of-the-box thinking was particularly prevalent among jazz musicians, singer-songwriters and composers. Participants unanimously said ensemble work — playing in bands, chamber music, orchestras and so on — has contributed positively to their workplace team dynamics. As one respondent put it: \"It taught me how to be part of something bigger than myself.\" Experiences in music translated to a greater appreciation of diversity and inclusivity, exceptional leadership and deep listening skills, and the ability to manage “difficult” conversations respectfully within a team. Respondents said an ongoing passion for music improved their mental health and workplace resilience. Unsurprisingly, their non-musician co-workers reported better workplace morale and an infectious positive energy from their musical colleagues. All respondents reported a healthy relationship with failure — experiences in music had taught them to remain curious, embrace learning and “fail forward” while owning errors. This attitude directly enhances one’s ability to upskill in a non-music careers, something many respondents have had to do. Eighty-two per cent of the exited and dual-career musicians had re-accredited, and 71 per cent admitted to “learning on the job”. Their live performance experiences cemented their ability to work under pressure in a variety of situations — public presentations, deadlines, project management. To them it was a no-brainer: “The show must go on.” Co-workers’ perceptions further verified the musicians’ transferable skills, suggesting they possessed high professional values, a strong work ethic, high intelligence, willingness to learn, and the ability to take the initiative. Survey respondents work in a much greater variety of fields than you might expect, including: Many also hold leadership positions. Economically, these findings suggest having a musician on the books may be linked to increased productivity, innovation, and profitability. The skills of the musically educated are relevant to far more than just the arts. Employers and recruiters need to respect and appreciate the professional contributions of the musically trained. But the ongoing decline in school music programs and nominal music teacher training, as well as a shift in tertiary training focus to science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the expense of the arts, suggest we’re heading the wrong direction. Including a well-informed understanding of music skills in repositories such as National Skills Passport would be a big step forward. So would ensuring all school children have access to proper music education, and that school leavers are not discouraged from pursuing further music training. Who knows, when the next pandemic comes, it could be a musician who designs the next life-saving vaccine.

    "article_content": "Commentary Singapore strives to be a competitive nation. At the same time, we seek to build a more inclusive, caring and compassionate society. Are these two objectives in tension? As Singapore strives to be a competitive nation, competition permeates workplaces, schools and every aspect of life, says the author. This audio is AI-generated. An economics expert asks: Is excessive competition impairing cooperation, making us collectively worse off? Or conversely, will a lack of competition blunt the drive for excellence and hinder progress? Over half (55 per cent) of workers in Singapore lack trusted relationships in the workplace, making them far more likely to report feelings of isolation than those with such relationships, reported health tech provider Telus Health in its Mental Health Index last month. Observers pointed to a competitive work environment as a contributor to isolation and burnout. As Singapore strives to be a competitive nation, competition permeates workplaces, schools and every aspect of life. At the same time, we seek to build a more inclusive, caring and compassionate society, a vision that resonates strongly among Singaporeans, as revealed in last year’s Forward Singapore exercise. Are these two objectives in tension, perhaps even inconsistent? Or can they be somehow reconciled? These are questions particularly pertinent to young Singaporeans as they seek success and fulfilment in a fast-changing society. Is excessive competition impairing cooperation, making us collectively worse off? Or conversely, will a lack of competition blunt the drive for excellence and hinder progress? Rather than view competition and collaboration as two ends of a continuum along which we must find an elusive equilibrium, it may be more useful to think about when competition is desirable and when it is more likely to be debilitating. This depends on the type and context of competition — specifically, whether competition enlarges or shrinks the collective pie. The competitiveness of Singapore’s school system has driven our students to excel academically, outperforming their peers in other countries. At the same time, there is increasing recognition that an overly competitive, exam-focused system may take a toll on students’ mental health and self-confidence, and may even undermine the love for learning. The Ministry of Education has in recent years underscored that learning is “not a competition” — it should be about personal growth rather than relative positioning. Hence, the PSLE aggregate score has been replaced by broader achievements “bands”, while mid-year examinations have been scrapped at all primary and secondary levels. However, exams remain relevant both as a yardstick of progress as well as an objective means of allocating students to schools and courses. Some element of competition is unavoidable because of limited places in popular courses and institutions. Ideally, motivation to learn and improve should come from within, but it often takes a dose of extrinsic motivation to get students to apply themselves to the task. Competition is valuable when it spurs us to improve ourselves, but not when it is socially wasteful. For instance, a higher education “arms race” benefits no one if people chase qualifications not for better skills and knowledge but merely for prestige or to signal their ability to prospective employers. Likewise, there is a need for an appropriate blend of competition and cooperation in the workplace. Employees vying for promotion and performance incentives are encouraged to give their best at work. However, competition taken too far undermines cooperation, which is necessary for the success of any department or organisation. While organisational culture and needs inform the intensity of competition among employees, good leadership can strengthen teamwork and collaboration so that a team is greater than the sum of its parts. Wherever possible, we should seek win-win outcomes rather than zero-sum competition. Singapore’s tripartite collaboration among unions, employers and government is a case in point. Rather than just contend over the division of the pie, unions and employers work together to grow the pie through training and productivity efforts. Sharing of gains and pain between workers and management during good times and bad helps to strengthen trust. There are instances, of course, where competition is the point in itself. Sports is one example of zero-sum competition that propels athletes to excel and generates thrills and spills for spectators. Still, sportsmanship is important, and players and supporters on both winning and losing sides can take satisfaction from a fairly contested, well-fought match. In politics, competition among political parties can improve government responsiveness and accountability to the public, but excessive partisanship can divide societies and render them dysfunctional. Respectful, constructive political competition — in short supply across the world today — is much needed for the future of governance in democratic states. For a strong economy, competition among firms is a must for both efficiency and growth. A tenet of classical economics is that market competition, under the right circumstances, results in an efficient allocation of resources across society. The gains from competition are not limited to efficiency in the static sense; over time, competition can also spur innovation and progress. Firms may develop better products or services to steal a march on the competition, while scientific and technological rivalry could generate breakthroughs and innovations. Antitrust or competition laws are therefore critical to prevent firms from using market power to stifle competition or undermine the public interest. However, competition may sometimes work against the interest of consumers. For instance, competitive bidding among local telcos for English Premier League broadcast rights led to higher costs for consumers, prompting the authorities to introduce the Cross-Carriage Measure in the pay TV market in 2011. There are also clear benefits from cooperation among firms. For instance, firms may collaborate on training to build up skilled manpower for their industry. Shared facilities and resources can lower costs and improve productivity. The government has also encouraged Singapore companies to “hunt as a pack” to seize market opportunities abroad. Beyond Singapore, there are strong indications that unbridled competition between nations states subtracts much more than it adds. Geopolitical rivalry is stoking tensions and undermining cooperation on common challenges such as climate change, transnational crime and disinformation. Trade restrictions, economic “decoupling” and technology bifurcation are already duplicating supply chains and shrinking the collective pie. Around 3,000 trade-restrictive measures were imposed around the world last year, nearly three times that in 2019. A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests that global economic fragmentation could cost the global economy up to 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Without effective international institutions to set limits on nation-states, perhaps other countervailing forces are needed — whether influential multinational corporations, global causes such as the climate agenda or other allegiances that can unite people across borders and temper the increasingly zero-sum competition among nations. A thoughtful recalibration of competition and collaboration is needed across the domains of school, work, industry and politics. Some forms of competition, such as those leading to greater effort and innovation, are clearly more beneficial to society than other forms. Competition should be recognised and even encouraged for the value it can bring — but where it becomes excessive or dysfunctional, it should be dialled back with appropriate laws, norms and nudges. Within the community of nations, there is an urgent need for new models and mechanisms of cooperation. It will take leadership, innovation, and concrete trust-building measures to turn states from the path of debilitating rivalry towards peaceful coexistence and shared progress.

    "article_content": "Commentary As many as 8 per cent of adults globally could have some form of neurodivergence. Bosses can be left wondering how they can support these employees without causing issues for the wider business. As many as 8 per cent of adults globally could have some form of neurodivergence. This audio is AI-generated. As more people are diagnosed with ADHD and other types of neurodivergence, recognition and understanding of their strengths and challenges can only be good for businesses in the long term, says this clinical psychologist. There has been a rise in the number of people diagnosed with “neurodivergence” in adulthood over the past decade. As many as 8 per cent of adults globally could have some form of neurodivergence. Neurodivergence is an umbrella term that typically includes autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific learning disorders (SLD) — sometimes referred to as dyslexia. The rise in these diagnoses when people are already in the workforce presents a challenge for employers. Business owners can be left wondering how they can support neurodivergent employees without causing issues for the wider business. Historically, diagnoses were predominantly made in children , with the view that people “grew out” of them as they developed into adults But research over the past decade indicates the majority of people with these conditions continue to experience symptoms throughout their adult life, albeit in different ways to childhood. Understanding neurodivergence is underpinned by the view that ASD, ADHD, and SLD reflect differences in how a person’s brain is “wired” rather than being an underlying “disorder”. This changing view appears to have increased awareness of neurodivergence. It has also reduced the stigma associated with it, leading more people to seek support as adults. A limited understanding of gender differences in the way neurodivergence is expressed, as well as limited access to psychological and psychiatric assessments in the public sector, have likely contributed to significant numbers of people missing out on childhood diagnoses. Many are now seeking assistance in adulthood. This rising tide of adults seeking to better understand their differences — and potentially seek treatment — has presented challenges for businesses and employers. But employers need not fear hiring those who are neurodivergent. Viewing neurodivergence as a difference rather than a disability contributes to an inclusive workplace where people’s strengths are recognised and celebrated. Some people with ADHD, for example, work very effectively in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines and rapidly changing content, such as journalism. People with ASD often have very specialised areas of interest that, if matched to the right work environment, can lead them to be experts in their fields. But it would be naive to say neurodivergence doesn’t bring with it some challenges for individuals and their workplaces. A person with ADHD may appear quite disorganised to others (and to themselves), and at times “put their foot in their mouth” through impulsively saying something they haven’t fully thought through. Those with ASD often report challenges in navigating social relationships at work, or may have particular sensory sensitivities (finding the general hubbub of open-plan offices anxiety-provoking, for example). They may struggle to process large amounts of written or verbal information, resulting in confusion and anxiety. Businesses and organisations looking to support neurodivergence in the workplace should initially focus on increasing awareness and understanding among leaders and managers. Managers need to work with individual staff who have self-identified as neurodivergent to understand and implement what is needed to support them. There may be some very practical steps that can be taken, such as having designated low-stimulus areas, providing noise-cancelling headphones, or understanding how best to communicate clearly and simply with an individual. Some staff may wish to take up psychological support via their workplace to help them develop skills in areas they find difficult. Perhaps the worst thing an employer can do is overlook neurodivergence as being present in the workplace. Ignorance, whether wilful or not, will lead to inaction. That said, it would also be a mistake for an employer to unilaterally refer a staff member for an assessment of suspected neurodivergence. To suggest someone is neurodivergent and requires a psychological assessment may lead to personal distress and potentially breach employment law. Employers should also be aware of the lengthy and complicated pathway to an adult diagnosis, due to factors such as lack of clear adult diagnostic criteria and shortage of trained clinicians. They can support staff in this process by allowing flexibility in work hours to attend specialist appointments, or even funding access to assessments in the private sector. The rise of awareness about neurodivergence mirrors the rise in awareness of mental health conditions in the workplace generally. Although this increased visibility can be confusing for some staff and organisations, recognition and understanding of neurodivergence can only be good for businesses in the long term. Helping people operate to their full potential by understanding their strengths and challenges will ultimately lead to thriving and productive workplaces.

    "article_content": "Commentary In Singapore, the uttering of words with the deliberate intention of wounding the racial feelings of a person is a punishable offence. Yet uses of racial slurs continue, particularly against members of the Indian ethnic minority. How can we support those negatively impacted by the use of racial slurs and other mistreatment? This audio is AI-generated. When a racial slur is used, it’s common for everyone — including the victim — to carry on as though nothing has happened. But, asks this senior lecturer in human resource management, what if we all didn’t pretend to be unaffected and indifferent to such events? In Singapore, the uttering of words with the deliberate intention of wounding the racial feelings of a person is an offence under Section 298 of the Penal Code, punishable with imprisonment of up to three years, a fine, or both. Yet, uses of racial slurs continue , particularly against members of the Indian ethnic minority . Every time such an incident makes it to national news, I feel a sense of violation and betrayal. As a member of this minority group, I do not need to be on the receiving end of racialised hate to experience, indirectly, the hurt and rejection inflicted upon the actual victims for the way they look. Members of dominant groups often perceive conversations about these events to be difficult, sensitive and high-risk. As such, it is common for the collective response that follows such incidents to be for everyone — including the victim — to behave as though nothing has happened, and carry on with no acknowledgment of the injustice that transpired. But what if we all didn’t pretend to be unaffected and indifferent to such events? On my own part, it would certainly make me feel less alienated to know that my friends and co-workers do not condone racialised hate or discrimination. Rather than avoiding discussion of such incidents, tackling them directly opens up space for healthy and meaningful exchange of perspectives, enabling individuals from dominant and marginalised groups alike to confront their inhibitions and create a shared climate that is psychologically safe, whether in a professional or social setting. Here are three action points for supporting those negatively impacted by the use of racial slurs and other mistreatment. Upon witnessing the use of racial slurs towards members of one’s community or receiving racial slurs directly, the lack of intervention or action from others can often lead to members of under-represented groups feeling alienated or even betrayed. Therefore, it’s important for each of us to first educate ourselves on the experiences and challenges faced by marginalised groups (such as Malay Muslims and/or the LGBT+ community) routinely affected by racial slurs and other forms of hate speech. Practice empathy by asking yourself these simple questions: “How would I feel if someone spoke to me that way? What would I need from those around me in order to feel less alone?” Seeking out articles, podcasts or op-eds by members of marginalised communities can also help with perspective taking. These self-education efforts will help us to “model” supportive behaviours that centre victims in such incidents, rather than our personal sense of comfort. Well-intentioned individuals may wish to speak up, but may be incapacitated by the fear of saying something wrong or overstepping sensitive boundaries — “What if I offend them by bringing it up? What if not being a minority means that it’s not my place to speak up?” In such scenarios, a simple acknowledgment of the incident would get the ball rolling. By initiating the conversation and sharing feelings of vulnerability with friends and colleagues of different identities and backgrounds, we can encourage each other to face our inhibitions and to openly show support and empathy. In any conversation regarding incidents of racial discrimination and hate speech, the focus should be on affirming the experiences and perspectives of our friends and co-workers from victimised communities, and showing respect and appreciation for them as valued members of society and the workplace. Trying to follow conventional tips and guidelines on what to say to friends and colleagues from marginalised groups can feel “fake” and contrived. “Is it weird if I ask ‘How are you’?” you may wonder. “Am I forcing it?” Hence, it is very important that we be authentic in our interactions — that is, to present ourselves authentically and thoughtfully. But how do we do this? Rather than worrying about what would be the “appropriate” language to use, focus on being open and genuine. Rather than striving to be right or wrong, strive to place the hurt individual’s perspective and needs at the forefront. When our words, thoughts, actions and non-verbal gestures are in sync with one another, we will be able to convey the message of solidarity and appreciation to our co-worker successfully. Finally, it’s critical to remember that each person may differ in their support needs. For some, simple acknowledgment and reassurance may be enough; others may prefer to focus on work or other topics as a productive distraction or coping mechanism. Some may find an open conversation with their friends and colleagues more suitable, to help them navigate complex emotions and thoughts. Placing the focus on those who have been hurt or negatively impacted ensures that we show support and allyship without being overbearing, and provide them the time and space they need to heal and restore.

    "article_content": "Commentary Employers and employees’ opposing sentiments on returning full-time to the office are seemingly coming to a head — and Tuesday’s announcement of the new guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests may have just rung the bell. Singaporeans can’t seem to agree on whether the opening up of requests for flexible working arrangements is a step forward, backward, or even sideways. But what if it's not a step in any direction at all? This audio is AI-generated. The new guidelines on flexible work arrangements aren’t meant to be a perfect solution, but a starting point that forces employers to come to the table and listen to their staff. Whether that conversation results in a win-win outcome depends on both sides' willingness to give and take, says this TODAY deputy editor. As a kid, I asked and pleaded and begged my mum for a puppy. Whenever she ran out of ways to dodge the question, she’d bring out the big guns: “Ask Dad.” She was confident that Dad would say no, and that would be the end of it. But what happens when Dad doesn’t say no? On Tuesday (April 16), a tripartite workgroup unveiled the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests . In these guidelines, the group — a collaboration between the Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress and Singapore National Employers Federation — stipulates that all Singapore firms should set up processes to receive and handle formal requests from employees for flexible work arrangements. This should come as no surprise, with the overwhelming majority of young adults continuing to prefer remote or hybrid working arrangements even as we put the Covid-19 pandemic in the rear-view mirror. In 2023, most of Singapore’s Gen Zers (69 per cent) and millennials (70 per cent) said they would seek out job opportunities elsewhere if their current employer were to mandate full-time on-site work, according to Deloitte research. As vocal as workers have been about not returning to the office full-time, employers have been just as vocal about wanting them back in the workplace. In October 2023, LinkedIn reported that seven out of 10 leaders in Asia-Pacific believed their companies would be “forced to wind back progress” on flexible working. After spending all of 2023 circling each other like two rival boxers in a ring, it seems the two opposing sentiments are finally coming to a head — and Tuesday’s announcement may have just rung the bell. Members of the public poured into the stadium to place their bets, alternating between hollering support and huffing displeasure. A large group quickly arrived at the conclusion that the move was, ultimately, a toothless display — a whole lot of fanfare over no real, tangible change. Workers can now request flexible work arrangements — so what? Companies can still easily reject such requests, they said. Big deal. Many took it upon themselves to remind others that employers are “not that nice”, with several voicing fears and expectations that workers will likely rue the day they attempted such requests (or have such requests granted) when their performance appraisals are negatively affected, not to mention their salaries or bonuses. Even if this comes out to something, said some, such a move will still be “unfair”. After all, not everyone would be able to benefit from such flexibility, including service and frontline workers. Equality fails again. Another camp of spectators threw their support behind the move. It may not be much, they said, but at the very least, it’s a step forward for better worker welfare in Singapore. For young adults, access to flexible work arrangements makes it easier to take care of ageing parents and relatives as well as kids. For older folks, flexibility enhances their ability to find and keep jobs as they age. Yes, non-office workers may never have this privilege or possibility, but that’s all the more reason to count your blessings, advised this group. Many also said that opening up such requests could be a step towards addressing other chronic issues in Singapore — for instance, nudging the nation’s minimum annual leave requirement up from the current seven days. At first glance, the new guidelines seem like a classic case of splitting the baby. As the saying goes: “No one is very happy, which means it’s a good compromise.” We can’t seem to agree on whether this is a step forward, backward, or even sideways. But what if it’s not a step in any direction at all? Really, the new guidelines are an opening: A door to more conversations between employers and employees about how to re-evaluate and improve both business performance as well as worker welfare. So maybe the real point we’re all missing is this: What does it say about Singapore work culture that this door wasn’t already open to begin with? Interestingly, a decent chunk of responses chose to warn of \"abuse\" of flexible work arrangements on both sides of the aisle: Greater freedom means employees will go MIA or slack off; greater remote access and looser structures means employers will make staff work after hours and on public holidays. Clearly, the issue is not really about who's in the office and when. It’s about trust between bosses and workers. And that trust seems to have broken somewhere along the way — more inimically than we’ve all realised. Repairing that trust starts with recalibrating our base view of jobs and work. At the end of the day, nobody wants to do badly at their job and nobody wants their company to fail. Of course, there are always occasional exceptions to the rule, but broadly speaking, we’ve all got that Majulah Singapura mindset — we all want better outcomes for our careers and businesses, as well as ourselves. We’re all on the same side. It’s not a zero-sum competition. It's give and take, not win or lose. But the simple truth is this: Expecting any one single move, no matter how big or small, to be a one-size-fits-all fix for all our problems will never turn out well. These guidelines aren’t meant to be a perfect solution, but a starting point that forces employers to come to the table and listen to their staff. Whether that conversation results in a win-win outcome depends on both sides' willingness to give and take. To be honest, I never got that puppy. Dad said no. But I did get to give a pretty cool five-minute presentation on why I thought I deserved that puppy — a presentation that earned me two hamsters. In the public debate on flexible working arrangements, we don’t have to split the baby, and we definitely don’t have to throw it out with the bathwater.

    "article_content": "Commentary When we consider how leaders get to the top, humility is probably not the word that comes to mind. Humble leaders tend to engage in more informal mentoring, and through that they gain influence and power in terms of promotability, say the authors. This audio is AI-generated. Research finds that humble leaders gain respect, prestige and prominence, and they gather a group of followers with high human capital. These experts say: If you want to be more promotable, it may pay to stay humble. When we consider how leaders get to the top, we might think of somebody like Jordan Belfort, the millionaire stock broker portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. And humility is probably not the word that comes to mind. However, Belfort’s rise was followed by a fall (he ended up in jail). For those who want to reach the top and stay there, it may be best to stay humble. Humble leaders express their humility in three dimensions. They view themselves accurately and acknowledge their limitations. They show appreciation for their followers’ contributions. They are also open to ideas and feedback. When leaders show all three attributes, they are considered to be humble. So how can humility help those who want to reach the top? We studied how humble leaders can become more promotable and found that they accomplish that by growing others in what is known as a “humility route”. Human capital theory suggests that employees’ value can be enhanced by investing in their knowledge, skills and abilities. It’s not only important for employees, it also creates value for organisations. Using human capital theory, our research shows that humble leaders focus on the learning and growth of their followers. By doing so, they also create human capital value for themselves in the process. Humble leaders tend to engage in more informal mentoring, and through that they gain influence and power in terms of promotability. They provide career guidance to their proteges and help them to prosper. But at the same time, their engagement in learning also boosts their own human capital. In such a developmental relationship, humble leaders gain respect, prestige and prominence, and they gather a group of followers with high human capital. This enhances their status in the organisation. It’s a win-win for leaders, their followers and the organisations they work for. Our study used survey data from a sample of 610 leaders who worked in 18 industries and across 21 job functions. The leaders’ direct followers, peers, immediate bosses and superiors reported back on the leaders. The measures in the survey included the leader’s humility, informal mentoring, status and promotability. We found that humble leaders earn higher status and enhanced promotability through engaging in mentoring behaviours. So if you want to be more promotable, it may pay to stay humble. But why are some leaders so arrogant if there is a “humility route” to success? A great deal of evidence shows that humble leaders outperform arrogant leaders. And yet, many leaders at every level have a hard time admitting mistakes, praising followers’ strengths and being teachable. The arrogant, narcissistic, bullying and dominating Wolf of Wall Street stereotype may be the most common and immediate route to the top. After all, this sort of behaviour can lead to quick wins which are are easily noticed and glamourised, reinforcing the stereotype in popular culture and media. But while this path can offer short-term gains, it often lacks stability. Even the famed Renaissance Italian political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli — a well-known figure of dominance strategy — ended up being tortured, imprisoned and then exiled. In contrast, humility offers a more stable and less visible route to success. Humble leaders typically achieve their status through fostering growth in others, engaging in mentoring, and creating a network of highly capable, loyal and enthusiastic followers. This network in turn provides the humble leader with high status, leading to them being viewed favourably by superiors. But such an approach may not grab attention or fit the dramatic narratives preferred by media, making it less visible to the public. The key difference lies in the nature of success each approach brings. Dominance may lead to a rapid ascent but is often accompanied by volatility. Humility, on the other hand, cultivates a foundation of strong relationships and a positive reputation, leading to a more stable and enduring success. This explains why the Wolf of Wall Street stereotype persists, despite the proven benefits of humility in achieving long-term leadership success. Expressing humility helps leaders earn career success as they increase human capital, which is vital to organisations. In recent years there has been a growing interest in humility in the workplace, particularly among leaders. It’s time to re-evaluate perceptions about the value of humility in leadership. You can show more humility as you lead. You can evaluate your own limitations and be sensitive to them. You can try to admit them by saying, “This is something I could do better.” You can also put your focus on the followers, acknowledge what they have done well and give them positive feedback. You can also be more open to feedback yourself and consider your followers’ ideas more. There are a few ways that organisations can cultivate humility. They can build the perception that expressing humility is valued. They can also organise training programmes that develop humility in leaders and consider including humility as part of performance evaluations. And lastly, they can encourage feedback on humble behaviours, promote informal mentoring and foster a culture of humility that centres on learning. That way, they can develop groups of employees who focus on the “humility route” to career success.

    "article_content": "Commentary The Life Insurance Association in Singapore in 2022 reported a critical illness protection gap of 74 per cent or S$579 billion for economically active Singaporeans aged between 20 and 69 in Singapore. In a 2023 survey on Gen Z insurance trends by FWD Singapore, more than 68 per cent of Gen Z respondents indicated that they do not have coverage for critical illness events such as cancer, stroke, and heart attacks. This audio is AI-generated. Many young adults might not see the urgency of proper insurance coverage now — but there are dangers in overlooking the potential risks and financial burdens that can arise from unexpected events. The Life Insurance Association in Singapore in 2022 reported a critical illness protection gap of 74 per cent or S$579 billion for economically active Singaporeans aged between 20 and 69 in Singapore. The protection gap refers to the difference between the level of financial protection one has and what one actually needs to safeguard against potential risks. Being underinsured means one is not sufficiently covered for unexpected events, leading to unwanted financial challenges. Closing this gap to ensure sufficient protection for medical emergencies, accidents, and unforeseen expenses is crucial for bolstering one’s financial security. More urgently, this gap is increasingly widening across generational lines. In a 2023 survey on Gen Z insurance trends by FWD Singapore, more than 68 per cent of Gen Z respondents indicated that they do not have coverage for critical illness events such as cancer, stroke, and heart attacks. Every generation is shaped by different backgrounds, circumstances, values and perspectives — differences which are reflected in their insurance needs and attitudes as well. The post-war generation (or baby boomers), generally aged above 60, largely tended to focus on retirement planning and healthcare, necessitating life insurance for estate planning and long-term care coverage. Generation X, in their 40s and 50s, strive to balance multiple financial responsibilities, requiring coverage for mortgages, dependents, and potential long-term care. In contrast, when it comes to millennials and Gen Z, there is a clear shift in insurance needs and priorities. Millennials, in their late 20s to early 40s, seek financial security for growing families, emphasising affordable health insurance and financial protection for debt obligations. Gen Z is the largest global generation, with its members reporting growing spending power and changing spending habits, according to Nielsen’s data. However, being teens and young adults in their early 20s, they are still only at the outset of their financial journeys. As such, they gravitate towards digital platforms and accessible insurance that lay the groundwork for their financial protection journey. As these emerging generations become significant consumer markets, insurers face a critical question: How can they better understand and cater to the changing needs of modern young adults? More and more data show that young adults prioritise meaningful work, flexibility, and autonomy over stable, linear career paths. In Singapore, a growing number of Gen Zs (46 per cent) and millennials (37 per cent) have taken on either a part- or full-time paying second job, showed research by Deloitte in 2023. This signifies a broader, more adaptable approach to work, that may encompass remote work, side hustles, and entrepreneurial pursuits. There are also diverse needs and different segments among young adults — from fresh graduates navigating their first steps into the job market, to gap-year takers in search of meaningful experiences, to those seeking conventional and unconventional routes to wealth accumulation. This shift not only transforms individual professional journeys but also impacts considerations in insurance coverage. Notably, research indicates that early retirement is becoming an increasingly popular concept among millennials and Gen Zs. Financial planning and investment patterns for this group of consumers will likely need to be altered accordingly. Many young adults might not see the urgency of this need now. Having had less time to gain and accumulate wealth at their age, insurance is not often top of mind for Gen Zers and millennials. The everyday young adult often navigates life with a sense of invincibility, believing that insurance coverage is a concern for older generations or unforeseeable emergencies. However, this perception overlooks the potential risks and financial burdens that can arise from unexpected events. While youth may bring a sense of vitality and freedom, it also comes with its own set of responsibilities, including the need to protect oneself against unforeseen circumstances. Initial responses from Gen Z respondents and feedback from younger clients and customers outside of the survey suggest that they largely perceive insurance as complex and costly. As such, efforts to inform and educate younger generations more widely and effectively are vital, to bridge the growing gap between their evolving life goals and insurance needs. Some financial services providers have begun launching programmes to introduce basic financial literacy concepts to students. Educating younger children and teens on simple approaches to money management and building a strong financial foundation is an important first step. Young adults need to understand that proper coverage extends beyond just health insurance to manage medical expenses. Other types of coverage, such as home insurance, motor insurance, and even life insurance, play significant roles in safeguarding one's financial well-being. Investing in insurance at a younger age often translates to lower premiums, as insurers typically consider younger individuals to be lower-risk. This means that securing insurance coverage early provides assurance, but it can also be a financially savvy decision in the long run. A few insurance providers are already offering simpler, more straightforward and affordable plans that can form the foundational blocks of critical illness plans, some starting from just S$20,000 sum insured. Opting for a smaller coverage is always recommended to having no coverage at all. As millennials and Gen Zers navigate flexible career paths, re-evaluate professional and financial goals and contemplate early retirement, it may be tempting to overlook the overarching importance of insurance coverage in their everyday lives — but the reality is that insurance serves as a crucial safety net for unforeseen events and financial hardships. By prioritising adequate coverage, they protect themselves and their assets, but also pave their own way for a more secure and resilient future. Tackling the responsibility of insurance today ensures that they can confidently navigate whatever challenges tomorrow may bring, allowing them to focus on pursuing their goals with peace of mind. On insurers’ part, more effort and resources need to be channelled towards tailoring approaches to meet the needs of young adults. The shifting values and aspirations of this demographic signal a need for providers to innovate and align with these evolving demands. Making moves to stay adaptable now will not only serve the current populace but also help to safeguard the coverage needs of future generations.

    "article_content": "Commentary Have you ever felt sick at work? Perhaps you had food poisoning or the flu. Your belly hurt, or you felt tired, making it hard to concentrate and be productive. How likely would you be to tell your boss you were unwell and had to go home? While employees would probably tell their boss about a stomach upset, many who menstruate and feel unwell as a consequence every month, are unlikely to talk about their difficult periods. This audio is AI-generated. The topic of menstruation is unquestionably still on the taboo list, and it is clearly affecting the workplace. A management researcher asks: How can we make workplaces more inclusive for people who menstruate? Have you ever felt sick at work? Perhaps you had food poisoning or the flu. Your belly hurt, or you felt tired, making it hard to concentrate and be productive. How likely would you be to tell your boss you were unwell and had to go home? While employees would probably tell their boss about a stomach upset, many who menstruate and feel unwell as a consequence every month, are unlikely to talk about their difficult periods. Especially at work. This was confirmed in our recent study of 247 students and workers who have periods. We found only 6.7 per cent would be honest with their employer about why they had to leave work or stay at home. Additionally, 87 per cent of those surveyed — 96 per cent identified as women — felt their period often interfered with their work or study. One respondent told us, “I would sometimes just say I wasn’t well and needed to work from home to be near a bathroom. I would let people assume it was gastro.” Another said, “I do not feel comfortable giving this as a reason to miss work as it feels like an excuse despite living in chronic pain.” The topic of menstruation is unquestionably still on the taboo list. And it is also clearly affecting the workplace. The good news is we are starting to see initiatives aimed at making workplaces more inclusive for people who menstruate. Having access to free period products seems to be paying off as our research found 84.6 per cent of employees said it makes them feel their workplace cares about them and reduces the likelihood they will leave work due to their period. One respondent explained, “Periods can be hard. I once bled through my clothes at work and had to leave. It was so stressful and humiliating. Free period products could just change someone’s day.” This is encouraging, but also suggests accessible products alone won’t lift the taboo and support a menstrual-inclusive workplace. More needs to be done. 1) Recognise the impact of periods Our study identified people who menstruate regularly experience physical symptoms such as abdominal pain (94 per cent), backache (82 per cent), and headaches (82 per cent) before or during their period. They also describe emotional symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, depression and irritability. One respondent said: “My cramps are so painful they make me feel physically sick — as though I will throw up. So I don’t like being out of the house because I can’t stand up straight.” And another: “My period increases my general level of anxiety in class, at work, and in all other situations. It can cause me to be acutely anxious during my classes and work, and I struggle to concentrate.” To avoid feelings of humiliation, shame and discrimination, people with their period often mask and hide symptoms. When this happens, employees report being less engaged and productive. By empathising with menstruators who are impacted in a wide variety of ways, organisations can support and empower them to look after their general and menstrual well-being. 2) Become an inclusive leader Inclusive leaders treat menstrual health as a justice and human rights issue that is collectively important for individuals and the organisation. These leaders recognise people with their period should be supported, so they talk to them about cultural and practical ways the workplace can make them feel safe and allow them to manage their period with dignity. This might mean providing free period products or offering menstruators flexible breaks and work hours when having their periods. Inclusive leaders recognise some people may need paid menstrual leave. 3) Normalise discussions about menstruation Inclusive leaders go further than practical strategies, they create a period-positive environment by challenging stigma and discrimination. They normalise conversations about menstruation, and ensure people who menstruate feel heard, supported and respected. They offer education and training to dismantle the menstrual taboo in workplaces, and replace it with a culture that embraces menstrual wellbeing. Ultimately, to make our workplaces equitable and inclusive, we must be willing to talk about menstruation openly and honestly and learn about the impact it has on employees. Only then will workers feel able to talk about what supports their health needs. THE CONVERSATION Ruth Knight is a researcher at the Queensland University of Technology, in Australia.

    "article_content": "Commentary For some, the benefits of moving out far outstrip the costs. For others, the price of freedom and independence will never be justified. For some, the benefits of moving out far outstrip the costs. For others, the price of independence will never be justified. But is there something deeper beneath the public debate? This audio is AI-generated. Moving out as a young single is undoubtedly costly, but why do Singaporeans judge others for how they choose to manage their own money as well as their mental and emotional well-being? A TODAY deputy editor explores the question: What if it’s not really about numbers in bank accounts, but about our ideas of “failure”? For young Singaporeans, the Covid-19 pandemic brought on several changes to life as we’d known it. Most learnt to adjust to remote work — some irrevocably so . Many picked up new hobbies and interests that pre-pandemic busyness had kept them from pursuing. And some realised that they just can’t live at home anymore. This week, TODAY’s mental health series Gen Zen explored the difficult dilemmas young singles face in deciding whether or not to move out of their family homes due to strained relations. Youths and mental health experts weighed in on how living independently can affect one’s well-being in both positive and negative ways: No one to bug you with endless nagging and questions, thumbs up! No one to help you with housework and chores, thumbs down. Given that young singles choosing to move out has long been a contentious topic in Singapore, perhaps it’s only natural that the column sparked a debate from readers and other members of the public. Despite the mental health benefits laid out by both this piece as well as many others already published on the subject in recent years, many felt that for young Singaporeans, the cons of moving out still far outweigh the pros. Let’s be real, these people said, there’s no way any amount of mental or emotional gain can make the financial cost of living independently worth it — especially as this cost continues to climb amid economic squeezes and pressures. Even if you manage to make enough to afford rent, said these dissenters, you may not actually be ridding yourself of the stresses that accompany living at home. They pointed out that in your desperation to escape friction or tension with your family, you could end up saddled with bad housemates or, even worse, a “nightmare” landlord. Same problem, different roof. All in all, this camp advised: Don’t make the mistake of giving up long-term financial gains for short-term peace of mind. Even so, many others stood by the intangible benefits of living away from one’s family. It’s not only about getting away from unhealthy or toxic situations, many said, but to gain some healthy growth and independence that would better prepare and ease one into full adulthood. A few rebutted the potential problem of difficult roommates or landlords by highlighting that such situations are useful opportunities for acquiring and practising various skills required for living harmoniously with others — undoubtedly valuable knowledge for Singaporeans, given the way our country’s land constraints require most of us to live in close quarters. Some shared how moving out early had greased the wheels on their progression into living with their current partners or spouses. Several added that living away from one’s family also makes it easier to have a love life — an unquestionable boon for Singapore, surely, given youths’ rising rates of singlehood and the downward slide of our birth rate. Moving out is a big change for anyone at any stage of life. For this — and for any other major decision, really — the scale on which we balance the pros and cons aren’t weighted the same way for everyone. For some, the benefits of moving out far outstrip the costs. For others, the price of freedom and independence will never be justified. Even so, why do we feel the need to judge others for how they choose to manage their own money, as well as their mental and emotional well-being? One Reddit user, AivernT, put this forth as the underlying “crux” of the entire debate: “We are so conditioned to hyper-optimise our finances to hit every milestone that any deviation appears to be considered a failure.” From this perspective, what we’re really worried about isn’t numbers in bank accounts. It’s about how we internalise our fellow Singaporeans choosing to make what we personally perceive to be a mistake — choosing “failure”. But why is this such a sensitive trigger for us? Singaporeans are well conditioned to avoid and guard against failure. As a small nation with grand ambitions and limited resources, we haven’t had much chance to enjoy a large margin for error, historically speaking. But now, nearly six decades into independence, our countless achievements speak for themselves. Singapore’s rise-and-grind culture has also earned us a global reputation for unparalleled hustlerdom. Perhaps we’ve done more than enough to earn ourselves a little breathing room. Some space to take a step back instead of letting all that conditioning prod us into deploring each other’s individual decisions, even when we don’t personally agree with the logic behind each one. Retooling the overwhelming instinct to avoid failure at all costs starts with retooling our understanding of what “failure” even is. A couple of responses offered up a new lens through which to calculate the cost-benefit analysis of moving out: Improving one's mental health environment may be a boost to one’s ability to perform far better in the workplace — which, in turn, could drastically improve one’s financial prospects. To one person, renting may be “throwing away money”. To another, it could be a crucial investment not only in their current well-being, but also their future growth. Of course, it’s still important to make wise decisions in life — keeping in mind that “wise” may look different for each one of us.

    "article_content": "Commentary Because of my condition, I will never experience many wonderful facets of life: A rollercoaster ride; a night out drinking at the bar; having a kid. With the advent of disease-modifying treatments, these things are no longer a pipe dream. The author, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, says new drugs could greatly improve his quality of life. Even so, he’s in no hurry to take costly medications to which continued, consistent access cannot be guaranteed due to the exorbitant price tag. At this year’s Committee of Supply debate, Nominated Member of Parliament Ong Hua Han asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider extending financial help for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to access disease-modifying treatments. Such treatments improve patients’ quality of life, but are not full-fledged cures. He cited a crowdfunding campaign by Singaporean games journalist Sherry Toh, who is trying to raise S$375,000 for a one-year supply of the drug Evrysdi (risdiplam), an oral medication to be taken daily. Evrysdi is the only treatment option registered with and approved by our Health Sciences Authority. Another treatment, Zolgensma, is a one-time gene therapy, but must be administered before a child turns two years old. It costs upwards of S$2 million. Children in Singapore have access to Zolgensma on a compassionate use basis. A few have managed to benefit from this drug, following successful crowdfunding campaigns to raise the millions of dollars needed. SMA, which I am also affected by , is a congenital neuromuscular disorder in which the nerve cells that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body weaken and die, causing progressive muscle weakness. Most patients are unable to stand or sit unsupported. As the disease worsens, problems with swallowing, speaking, and breathing occur. SMA is a rare disease — according to a 2023 MOH statement, there are only about 40 to 50 patients in Singapore. It is also terminal . I’ve never been one to sugarcoat or romanticise my condition. The fact is: It sucks. I can’t do many things most people would consider routine, like moving around independently or eating delicious food. Even the simple things that I can do for myself take huge reserves of energy, and I find myself tired and in discomfort all the time. Because of SMA, I will never experience many wonderful facets of life: A rollercoaster ride; a night out drinking at the bar; having a kid and teaching him to play football. With the advent of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), especially when administered to a young child who is still in the early stages of the disease, these things are no longer a pipe dream. Children in the United States who were given Zolgensma as newborns several years ago are now running around schoolyards with their friends — something that would have been unfathomable a decade ago. Closer to home, Ms Toh noted on her campaign page that her ability to swallow water improved after she received a complimentary three-month supply of Evrysdi on a compassionate basis from manufacturer Roche. Before, she would have taken about 52 seconds to drink a given amount of water. After starting on the drug, her time decreased to 16 seconds. DMTs have changed the SMA landscape forever. But every discussion on DMTs in Singapore runs into the same issue: Cost. In the US, insurance covers the cost of DMTs and allows ready access to those who need it. Here in Singapore, though, patients have no option at the moment but to figure out a way to pay the exorbitant price tag on their own. Here are my rough calculations: If I want to get treated with Evrysdi, I would have to work my white-collar office job for more than five years to save up enough for a single year of treatment. This is why I’m ambivalent about even starting on the drug, which relies on taking consistent doses in order to sustain its effects. What happens if I no longer have access to this costly drug? The joys and freedoms, and the improvements to my quality of life it would bring — all those positive effects would go away in an instant. It seems really cruel to put myself through that. And so, I’d rather not commit to the treatment while financial cost is still the biggest stumbling block to my continued access to it. I don’t enjoy having SMA — but after 26 years, I’ve come to terms with it. I’ve become used to living my life while working around the ever-increasing limitations my disease places on me. I’m in no hurry to plunge myself into a situation where I have to constantly worry about running out of money to buy medicine, or be subject to the trauma of finding myself robbed of my newfound strength and independence all over again. Don’t get me wrong: I’m not saying I don’t want medicine that could better my life. If our health insurance system suddenly became like the US’s overnight, and I could access Evrysdi with little worry about the price, I would take it in a heartbeat. But the reality is that our system is set up completely differently. It’s not my intention to “fix” our system with this piece — plenty of other highly qualified writers and experts have suggested solutions to the affordability problems facing rare disease treatment. For example, the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) could potentially help SMA patients afford DMTs, if SMA gets added to the list of diseases it covers. But even if so, the RDF has a very small quantity of funds available to it, and a growing quantity of demand on these funds. SMA is just one of a whole constellation of rare diseases out there, and treatments for all of them are just as expensive, if not more so. It would of course be ideal to help every patient who needs support — but we don’t live in an ideal world. Funds are finite. There are only two options: Be selective in who gets help, or get more funds. Getting more funds is, in turn, a whole other can of worms because of opportunity cost. If the government allocates more money to the RDF, that’s money taken away from some other use or need, like education or assisting the elderly or cushioning the impact of inflation on the lower income. At the governmental level, I trust Singapore is doing the best it can for the RDF. That brings us back to being selective in who gets help. Unfortunately, allocating resources is, by nature, a zero-sum game. Let me put it this way: If the RDF has to choose between subsidising treatment for me or a young child also suffering from SMA, I’d rather medical help goes to the kid. Stopping his SMA progression at a much earlier stage means he will retain more of his physical abilities and strength. He will have his whole life ahead of him, giving him a much longer runway to do lots of amazing things that I can only dream of. While we figure out how to address the funding gap, one intermediate step I do wish for the authorities to consider is to make SMA testing more prevalent in Singapore. Many developed nations screen newborns for SMA through a simple blood test. According to Novartis, which developed Zolgensma, 45 per cent of babies in Europe are tested for SMA at birth. This compares to 44 per cent in Australia and an impressive 80 per cent in Taiwan. Early detection of SMA is crucial in the age of DMTs because the sooner the patient begins treatment, the better the outcome in the long run. Besides rolling out more widespread newborn screening for SMA, I’d like Singapore to dream even bigger: Introduce routine carrier testing for the gene that causes SMA. This is also possible through a simple blood test. I understand from my relatives’ experiences with starting a family that, currently, couples are advised to get tested for the gene only if they have a family member with SMA like me. But with one in 40 people carrying the SMA gene, there are actually many people out there who are blissfully unaware. All it takes is for two of them to procreate, and their child will have a 25 per cent chance of having SMA. I personally always encourage my newly married friends to ask for the test before having kids. If couples are aware of their carrier status before they try for a baby, they will be in a better position to make an informed decision on whether to go ahead with reproductive efforts or consider alternatives such as adoption. Ultimately, SMA is a devastating disease which incurs costs that go far beyond the financial. The physical and psychological toll it takes on patients and their families cannot be quantified. Making any decisions regarding SMA — or any other rare disease for that matter — is a highly personal affair involving a complex interplay of each individual’s dreams, fears, beliefs, values, and life circumstances. There are no easy or correct answers, but with the knowledge we have available to us at any given moment, we can make the decision that feels right for us, and then make the best of it.

    "article_content": "Commentary As artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI continue to rapidly evolve and reshape our lives, safeguarding our children has never been more critical. This audio is AI-generated. As artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI continue to rapidly evolve and reshape our lives, safeguarding our children has never been more critical. Earlier this year, the chief executives of five major social media companies testified in a US Senate hearing on Big Tech and the online child sexual exploitation crisis, sparking a heated debate on child online safety and mental health. Currently, researchers vary in their views on the effects of technology use on children's well-being. That said, what we do know is that social media use and mental health problems in youths have increased in tandem; more and more studies are finding links between the two in several contexts. What all experts seem to agree on is that tech industries and governments alike need to work to create better online environments for our children. In the midst of all this, the integration of AI into various digital platforms and services has introduced new complexities to the online safety landscape. As parents, guardians, and caregivers, we need to understand both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI and equip ourselves with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate these complexities effectively. Here are some ways in which AI complicates things: Enhanced personalisation : AI algorithms used by popular streaming platforms analyse user data to recommend content tailored to individual preferences, potentially exposing children to inappropriate material beyond parental control. Deepfakes and manipulated content : AI enables the creation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos. This allows malicious actors to fabricate content that can deceive and harm children, such as fake celebrity endorsements of dangerous or illicit materials or altered news clips spreading wrong or misleading information. Algorithmic bias : Social media platforms employ AI algorithms that may inadvertently amplify biases against certain demographics, resulting in discriminatory content distribution and fostering negative perceptions among children based on factors like ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic status. Privacy concerns : AI-driven smart toys and devices, such as smart speakers and interactive dolls, often collect and store children's personal data without robust privacy protections, raising concerns about unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential exploitation by third parties for targeted advertising or identity theft. While AI introduces new challenges to online safety, it is also a promising tool in bolstering online safety measures with its advanced algorithms that can swiftly analyse vast amounts of data, allowing for the rapid identification and mitigation of potential threats and harmful content. Here's how AI can be leveraged to enhance online safety for children: Content moderation : Platforms like TikTok and Instagram use AI algorithms to automatically flag and remove inappropriate content, such as violent or explicit videos in violation of their community standards, ensuring a safer browsing experience for young users. Adaptive parental controls : Apps like Google Family Link and Apple Screen Time employ AI algorithms to analyse children's online activities and adjust parental controls accordingly, allowing parents to set limits on specific apps, websites, or screen time based on their child's age and behaviour. Cybersecurity solutions : AI-driven cybersecurity software like CrowdStrike and Halcyon utilise machine learning algorithms and generative AI to detect and block online threats, such as viruses, malware, and phishing attempts, protecting children's devices and personal information from cyberattacks. Digital well-being features : Platforms like Apple iOS and Android devices offer digital well-being features powered by AI algorithms that monitor screen time, track app usage, and provide insights into device usage patterns, helping parents and children maintain a healthy balance between online and offline activities. While AI-driven solutions and regulations can contribute to maintaining online safety, parents and caregivers also need to get closely involved. Here are practical recommendations on how to further enhance your children's online safety: Establish open communication : A recent survey by the Ministry of Communications and Information highlighted that parents are not always aware of children’s online gaming activities. It's essential to establish a supportive and open dialogue with your children about their online experiences. Continually encourage them to share what they enjoy about these activities and to ask questions where they’re unsure, fostering an environment where they feel comfortable discussing any concerns or incidents they may encounter. Prioritise digital literacy for the whole family : Digital literacy impacts the necessary skills needed to thrive alongside AI and to be resilient both online and offline. Begin by educating yourself about various aspects of technology, including AI, and best online safety practices. By teaching family members, especially children, about responsible online behaviour — such as respecting others’ privacy and protecting their own, avoiding cyberbullying, and critically evaluating information — they can navigate the online world responsibly and identify potential risks and threats. Co-create rules around usage : Nurture a collaborative approach within your family to co-create boundaries and rules regarding screen time, appropriate content consumption, and online interactions. Rely on expert guidance to create these rules and regularly review and adjust these guidelines as needed to ensure they remain relevant and effective in promoting a healthy and balanced digital lifestyle for everyone. Lead by example : There is mounting evidence that how parents use digital media can have a big impact on their children’s development. Be mindful of your own online behaviours and habits, as children often model their behaviour based on their parents'. Set a positive example as a technology role model by promoting quality tech use for your children. This can involve dedicating phone-free time each day to do activities with your child or choosing online activities together that are educational and enriching, like playing games, exploring videos and tutorials on hobbies such as painting, crafts, gardening etc. Stay informed and engaged: Engage with your children's digital experiences to understand their behaviour, enabling you to monitor any sudden and unexpected changes in mood and well-being. Rather than avoiding new technologies like AI out of fear, it’s important to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, so you can both appreciate their vast possibilities while maintaining safety for you and your kids in this new digital age.

    "article_content": "Commentary Many companies still draw the line at letting their staff take up side jobs — but what if they actually increase employee engagement and productivity? Office workers in the Central Business District at Raffles Place on Sept 22, 2021. This audio is AI-generated. Many companies still draw the line at moonlighting — but what if it actually increases employee engagement and productivity? Here’s why this chief executive allows his staff to take up side jobs. One day in 2007, an employee came to me with a bold request: He wanted to take on a side job. My immediate instinct as a chief executive was to refuse. “No moonlighting” was then the norm throughout most of Asia. But when I thought about it some more, I couldn’t think of a strong enough reason. He might have less time to focus on his job, but that’s also true of people with family obligations. More work outside the company might tire him out more and increase the risk of him making mistakes, but no worse than after a heavy night of drinking — should we prohibit all alcohol consumption too? I soon realised that my stance on moonlighting was based not on grounded logic, but on negative stigma already prevalent in working culture. Did I really want to limit this employee’s options for growth and self-fulfilment on these grounds? In the end, I decided to allow it. Since then, side jobs have not only become an integral part of our corporate identity and human-resources policy but also a valuable recruiting tool. Moonlighting is becoming increasingly popular in Singapore, with over 13 per cent of employees participating in it extensively in 2023, reports job platform Indeed. While the primary driver is rising costs of living, other oft-cited reasons include a desire to retire early, learn new skills, or engage in a creative endeavour. Side jobs present a whole host of opportunities for employees. For example, engineers might develop skills they wouldn’t be able to acquire by working only for my company. Content creators can improve their creative abilities by taking on various external writing, filming, or editing projects. Managers can deepen their understanding of business trends by working with startups. All of these are concrete examples I have personally seen. Despite this, moonlighting — while not illegal — is still frowned upon by most employers, and many companies include a clause against it in their employment contracts. Bosses worry about divided loyalty, arguing that a side job prevents employees from being fully invested in their primary job. Someone working multiple jobs can’t possibly be productive in all of them, they claim. These are reasonable concerns. However, given how far we’ve come in the last two decades, they seem to stem from an outdated perception of the optimal relationship between workers and their workplaces. The primary goal of recruitment is hiring competent people who are both willing and able to do a good job. To this end, should employers aim only to squeeze every last bit of productivity out of their employees? Or should they aim instead to encourage their workers to develop motivation to contribute to the best of their ability and compensate them accordingly? The latter approach is proving to be a superior way to guarantee long-term worker engagement. The proof is in my company’s low turnover rate, which hovers around 5 per cent — far below the rate of 15 per cent we were seeing before allowing our employees to moonlight, as well as the global average voluntary turnover rate of 14.5 per cent reported by financial services company Mercer in its Asia-Pacific 2023 survey. Allowing moonlighting is not the same as saying employees can do whatever they want. My company’s stance is to allow side jobs, not actively encourage them. Even flexible work environments must have reasonable, common-sense limits. For instance, employees still have to abide by national laws regarding work hours. Businesses would also do well to prohibit employees from simultaneously working for a competitor. There are also more situational limitations which managers and employees must work out together. If someone is struggling with their current workload, can they justify taking on another role elsewhere? In some cases, they may have to reduce their hours or responsibilities — how should this impact compensation? In my own experience, it’s worth noting that most employees are not actually interested in moonlighting: Only around 10 per cent of our staff report having a secondary source of income. However, for that minority, the benefits of moonlighting are undeniable and too often overlooked by employers. As workplace flexibility continues to climb to the top of many people’s career priorities, top talents expect more from their employers. For some people, a “no side jobs” clause may be a deal breaker; for many companies, it may mean shutting out good workers who simply want to cultivate new talents or experience several types of work. With the global trend of “quiet quitting” set to continue into 2024, employers need to think about how to better motivate employees to show initiative and be self-reliant. In this vein, it doesn’t make sense to impose arbitrary limitations on how they build and enrich their careers. What’s far more important is to adapt an organisation’s culture to better accommodate increased flexibility and worker autonomy. First, emphasise transparency and communication. Open up channels and processes for anyone with a side job to communicate that information with their managers and team members. Openness is key: If employees take time off during work hours, whether for a side job or a private engagement, have them register their absence clearly in shared company calendars or rosters. Second, consider valuing results and output over “traditional” metrics such as hours spent at work. Letting employees select their workstyle and compensating them based on results and market value can offer greater adaptability. Finally, flexibility needs to be supported by the right workplace tools. One of the main reasons we’ve seen a trend towards more diverse workstyles is how far digitalisation and remote work software have come. Side jobs are easier to manage when you don’t have to worry about falling out of the loop in your main job. By enhancing these three elements, companies can redesign their workplace culture where flexibility and adaptability are critical to building a resilient and successful business. It would be unwise to squander talent and opportunities because we can’t stop clinging to the rigid beliefs and practices of the past.

    "article_content": "Commentary On Jan 14, 2008, a speeding van skidded and collided head-on with our family car on the expressway. Unable to get out of our vehicle, we had to wait for assistance from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. This audio is AI-generated. No matter what safety measures and precautions we take on the roads, the stark truth is that we are at the mercy of other road users. This is how Singapore can take a more holistic approach to guard against speeding and other hazardous road behaviour, says a Singapore University of Social Sciences senior lecturer. On Jan 14, 2008, a speeding van skidded and collided head-on with our family car on the expressway. Unable to get out of our vehicle, we had to wait for assistance from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. My parents, in the front seats, both suffered broken bones and other injuries. The perpetrator emerged unscathed, and my parents could see him standing nonchalantly beside his vehicle, speaking on his mobile phone without bothering about their well-being. As for myself in the back seat, the seat belt had kept me safe, but the impact also caused some blood vessels around my small intestines to rupture. This was only discovered during an exploratory laparotomy (like a C-section but done in the old-school vertical manner). I still have the large vertical scar. To this day, I still encounter situations in motor vehicles where panic floods me and I have to grab onto something to calm myself. This happens most often when I book a ride on a ride-hailing service, and private-hire drivers not only speed but also fail to maintain a safe distance from the car in front. Whenever I ask these drivers to “drive slower / safely”, my request is usually met with either a muttering of dissatisfaction and a slowing down for a minute or two before returning to their original speed, or complete dismissal and disregard. Upon hearing of the April 22 fatal accident in Tampines , my initial response was that of sadness, especially as it emerged that two lives had been taken away too soon. At the same time, as in-car camera footages started to surface online, I felt a growing swell of anger about this inexplicable accident which had resulted in the deaths of two people, harm to others, and brought grief to so many in the community. I soon realised that I was so affected by this episode not just because of my own past trauma, but because it could have happened to my children as well. As a parent, you tell yourself that your children will be fine if you equip them with the skills and knowledge to remain safe on the roads. For example, we teach them to belt up in vehicles, and to wait for the green man at pedestrian crossings and look both ways for oncoming traffic before stepping onto the road. The stark truth is that no matter what safety measures and precautions we take on the roads, we are at the mercy of other road users. Unfortunately, many road users do not take this responsibility seriously. I observe speeding occurring daily, oftentimes by heavy vehicles which have the potential to cause more serious harm. It’s also common to encounter drivers that neglect to signal, smoke while driving, or appear distracted either by conversing with a passenger or by using their mobile phones while driving. What could an ideal future with safer roads in Singapore look like? In an ideal world, we would eliminate speeding completely. All vehicles could come equipped with Intelligent Speed Assistance technology, where traffic signs can automatically ensure vehicles comply with corresponding speed limits through an onboard communication system. In-car cameras could also become standard in all vehicles, and footage of traffic violations synced via cloud to an artificial intelligence-powered analytics program administered by the authorities to detect traffic violations. More crucially, footage of accidents could be obtained directly and not subject to external manipulation or interference. In addition, drivers’ road behaviours could be factored into other aspects of car ownership such as the cost of renewing one’s road tax or insurance, or even increasing the cost of future Certificates Of Entitlement (COEs) for recalcitrant drivers by factoring in a multiple as a “hazard tax”. All these require a whole-of-government approach towards car ownership and road safety, making it more burdensome for road users to behave recklessly. None of these proposed solutions are foolproof or easy to implement — for example, how should non-Singapore registered vehicles be dealt with? — but they strive towards transformational rather than incremental change. New requirements for speed limiters on lorries in Singapore have been announced and will be progressively rolled out till 2027 — a good start, but insufficient. First, all new-imported lorries should have a speed limiter installed; this should be implemented much sooner than the proposed deadline of Jan 1, 2026. All goods vehicles should also have speed limiters, regardless of size. A heuristic could be that if the vehicle has a label with a speed limit, it should require a speed limiter. Such an initiative could have prevented the accident my parents and I were involved in, for example. Our traffic laws should also be strengthened as an effective deterrent against speeding and other hazardous road behaviour. The Traffic Police are increasing penalties for selected offences, but could consider firmer action such as a lifetime ban from driving for cases where lives are lost. Such an option would better factor in the principles of deterrence, retribution and public protection, and serve a stern reminder to all that possessing a driving licence is a privilege that comes with responsibilities. Last, the enhancement of penalties will only be effective if complemented by a consistent enforcement regime, which will require adequate resources. Road users should be encouraged to support enforcement efforts by providing feedback on reckless driving. Currently, the process for submitting traffic feedback is cumbersome and limited by requirements such as file size of submitted videos; it’s also not uncommon for members of the public to receive no response to their provided feedback. Any solution should ideally automate or make easy the ability to enforce traffic laws for both the authorities and community. Such systemic transformations could be costly, but the benefits of safer roads would greatly outweigh the costs incurred. As a car owner, it may mean that I cannot afford another car when my COE expires in future; but as a father, it could also mean that my children do not have to face the risk of grievous harm — or even death. In my view, that is a price worth paying. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nicholas Netto is a senior lecturer in social work at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.

In a bid to scale my parent coaching business, Juicy Parenting, I recently waded into the murky waters of Facebook ads. I had been warned by more experienced marketers that greater exposure via online advertising would necessarily mean greater exposure to online trolls. True enough, barely a week into my Facebook ads foray, I received the following comment from a stranger: “Would never take parenting advice from an Asian.” Based on her profile, she was a Caucasian grandmother from Louisiana, United States. At first, I was in disbelief. Who would say such a thing out loud, much less put it online for all to see? Doesn’t she know that one’s digital footprint can never be wiped off the internet? Once I got over my shock at the blatant racism, however, I did start to wonder: Why does this person have such a negative impression of Asian parents in the first place? What Asian families has she encountered that have led her to believe that we have nothing to offer? At this juncture, I want to be perfectly clear: The point isn’t to pit “Western parenting” against “Asian parenting”, nor to start a fruitless argument about which is “better”. Sure, some aspects of Asian parenting — with its typically harsh and punitive approaches — can be improved. But that certainly doesn’t mean Western parenting is perfect, or has all the answers, either. Also, it’s worth emphasising that not all Asian and Western parents are the same. There are many Asian parents who choose not to hit their kids, just as there are many Western parents who reach for the belt and spank their children. The point here is simply to reflect upon myself, my work, and my community, to ask ourselves: How can we completely redefine what Asian parenting can look like in a modern age? Is it possible for us to let go of traditionally harsh and punitive approaches, and embrace evidence-based ones that prioritise connection and mutual respect instead? The truth is, there is a lot about traditional Asian parenting that needs to change. For one, we’ve got to stop hitting and caning kids. This is often believed to be a “Western” philosophy — something that works for “them” but not “us”. However, local research — including a 2022 study by Singapore Children’s Society and Yale-NUS College — has shown that childhood beatings are not only ineffective in teaching moral values, they are also consistently associated with increased aggression, poorer emotional regulation, and lower self-esteem. These negative effects often last well into adulthood. Next, we need to shift our lens when it comes to crying and “negative” emotions. It’s common to hear this advice doled out to new parents: “Don’t give your toddler attention when they cry. Just ignore them — they’ll soon realise it has no effect on you.” But psychologists have long warned that this is not only counter-productive, but also damaging. It could even be tantamount to emotional neglect. US paediatric psychologist Dr Mona Delahooke notes: “Rather than ignoring, it’s best to do the opposite: Pay extra attention to behaviours, and ask the question: How can we help the child to communicate? “When we ignore children, we risk shutting down their attempts to do what we want them to do most: Communicate with us.” Third, it’s time to stop expecting blind obedience from our children. The most well-known example of this can be seen every day, where we meet their curious “Why?” with “Because I’m your father/mother and I said so.” Is it harder to take the time to explain our boundaries? Yes. Will our kids always get it, or be satisfied with our explanation? No. Does that mean we shouldn’t bother at all? Of course not. It doesn’t mean we should lapse into permissiveness, either. The point is to refrain from using dead-end strategies, that wrongly signal to kids that asking questions — or even expressing disagreement respectfully — is a crime. This way, we have a much better chance of raising individuals with well-developed critical-thinking skills and habits. At the same time, there’s so much that’s good and timeless about Asian parenting that needs to stay. For starters, long may our respect for elders continue. Those with more experience deserve to be valued by the societies they spent their lives helping to build. We should also continue to uphold our fierce loyalty to family. In a world where loneliness is on the rise across the globe, intergenerational interdependence is a strength, not a weakness. In addition, Asian parents’ deep sense of responsibility and unwavering work ethic must be treasured, as it fuels our willingness to do whatever it takes to give our kids a leg up in life. These strengths are exactly why I’ve always believed that Asian parents have so much potential to be great. But we waste it by continuing to let fear guide our parenting, by believing adages like “不打, 不成才” (which translates to “If you don’t hit your kids, they’ll amount to nothing” — basically, the Chinese equivalent of “spare the rod, spoil the child”). As with anything else, it’s always best to double down on what works, and tweak what doesn’t. Imagine the sea change we’d make to the generations down the line, if we just tried to grow beyond traditional mindsets. As for that internet troll who said she would never take parenting advice from an Asian? Here’s how I responded: “That’s okay, I’m not for everyone! Hopefully your kids break the cycle of making snap judgments about an entire continent of people.” That’s the kind of future I want for my kids: Where they won’t stand for others’ poor behaviour; where they’re able to disagree respectfully; and where they can hold their position firmly and kindly. But that can only happen if we first raise them firmly and kindly, too. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Kelly Tay is a parent coach, the founder of Juicy Parenting and a mother of two.

Or attended a conference only to leave immediately after the scheduled speakers wrap up on stage, so that you can avoid the post-programme mingling? For the first 15 years of her professional life, the author avoided networking like the plague. This audio is AI-generated. \"Being an introvert, I could never bring myself to approach a stranger and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and fake,\" writes the author, a UX designer. Here's how she managed to make networking less nerve-wracking for herself. Have you turned down invitations to networking events? Or attended a conference only to leave immediately after the scheduled speakers wrap up on stage, so that you can avoid the post-programme mingling? I have. Being an introvert, networking made me cringe and my stomach churn. It made me want to turn and flee — and I often did. For the first 15 years of my professional life, I avoided networking like the plague. On the few occasions I absolutely had to attend a conference or an industry event, I mostly stood around awkwardly, watching some people breeze into the crowded room and effortlessly strike up a conversation with others like long-lost friends. I could never bring myself to approach a stranger — or worse, a group of strangers — and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and “fake”. Over time, I convinced myself that networking just wasn't my cup of tea. Two years ago, I embarked on a big career transition from procurement to user experience (UX) design. To improve at a faster rate, I wanted to meet more UX designers to learn about their experience and to seek feedback on my portfolio. For once, I felt the push to reach out to others in the industry. I knew I had to do something to overcome my discomfort with networking. So, for the first time in my life, I attended a networking event entirely out of my own volition. And I did it alone . My heart was pounding fearfully as I stood by myself and scanned the crowd for a friendly face. I eventually mustered the courage to approach someone — a small business owner pivoting into UX design. We ended up having a great conversation about our respective career transition experiences. It turned out that she was also a user of my agency’s digital platform, so as a bonus, I managed to get some customer insights too. After crossing that first hurdle, I felt more at ease and confident, and it became easier to initiate conversations with the others at the event. At the end of the day, I left the event happy, with a whole slate of new connections. That day brought me to a realisation: By reframing how I felt about networking, I was able to let go of my self-doubt and insecurities. Instead, I now see networking as just another skill that we can practise and get better at — just like learning a new sport or a new language. I also see how valuable networking can be. It can help you to open new doors, learn something new, or just to make new friends. Truthfully, I still feel awkward at the start of each event — but by the end, I always have something valuable to take away with me when I leave. Here are some tips I picked up over time to make networking less nerve-wracking for me. #1: Know your ‘why’ To reduce your social anxiety, go in with a broader objective than purely to “network”. Ask yourself: Why are you attending this event in the first place? Take the pressure off yourself by redirecting the focus to other people or things. For example, I attend events that focus on key topics or feature speakers that I’m already interested in. When I’m going to an event with the purpose of learning something, the “networking” part becomes less of a sticking point in my head. #2: Start with small goals Are you networking in a bid to score a job referral, or to make 10 new connections? If lofty goals such as these seem overwhelming to you, you can always start small. Aiming to make just one new connection can be enough. #3: Make genuine connections Networking can often feel “fake”. It can feel like you’re going around trying to promote yourself to people you don’t know — and that can be extremely uncomfortable for introverts like me. It doesn’t have to be this way. Introverts often excel in active listening, and they thrive in intimate, small settings. Use that strength to your advantage, and seek to make genuine connections. For my part, I strive to approach new connections with a curious mindset: With each new person I meet, I aim to learn at least one interesting thing about them. This makes the engagement meaningful and reduces the discomfort about making “small talk” with strangers for no real reason. #4: Prepare and practise Starting conversations can be daunting for many introverts. One reason for my anxiety was that I was just not prepared enough. I never thought about how I was going to introduce myself, what questions I would ask, and how I would exit the conversation. Preparing and practising beforehand can give you that extra boost of confidence. Over time, it will become more natural and you will find that you don't need so much practice before the event. #5: Go alone This may seem counterintuitive. After all, you’re already anxious about networking. Shouldn’t you attend such an event with a friend or someone familiar for support? Hear me out. In my experience, whenever I go to an event with a friend — especially another introvert — chances are the two of us will end up spending the entire time engaged in conversation with each other. We miss out on opportunities to connect with other people. Going alone pushes me out of my comfort zone, so that I have more reason to take the first step to interact with someone new. Let’s say you went out on a limb and attended a networking event alone, doing your best to employ the tips and tricks above. It’s possible that you may still fail to meet anyone new. If you didn’t manage to make any new connections, or if you didn’t even make it to the mingling portion of the event (like I struggled to before), don’t be too hard on yourself. It’s not the end. There’s always another opportunity. Like with learning any new skill, what’s more important is that after each attempt, you reflect on what went well and how you can do better. If you did manage to meet new people, give yourself a pat on the back. Note down what you did to help you achieve that, and think about how you can repeat it or improve further upon it the next time round. As with any skill, the only way to get better and strengthen our confidence is to allow ourselves to practise and learn from our own mistakes.

    "article_content": "Commentary Just a few months ago, women took to TikTok in droves to share videos of themselves testing their partners’ love by asking them to peel an orange. This audio is AI-generated. Online content on love and relationships such as the \"orange peel theory\" can be fun, but if you find yourself routinely turning to social media fads as a real-world litmus test for your partner, perhaps it’s a sign to hit pause and reflect, says this communications strategist. Just a few months ago, women took to TikTok in droves to share videos of themselves testing their partners’ love by asking them to peel an orange. It was funny to watch this fad play out — Singaporeans even put their own spin on it by asking their partners to peel prawns instead. But it also makes one wonder how much weight we're putting on these touted ideals when we put our phones down. Having grown up in the digital age, I've always been drawn to social media for guidance on everything from career to food, and relationships. With just a tap or scroll, we can easily access bite-sized advice tailored to our specific concerns. In a world where time is of the essence and instant gratification is the norm, the quick fixes offered online are very appealing to modern young adults dealing with relationship dilemmas. But I’ve begun to notice how toxic Internet dating content can seep into our real lives, subtly perpetuating harmful stereotypes and eroding the foundation of healthy relationships. For women, such advice often trends towards glorifying jealousy, fixating on superficial signs like texting habits, and equating love with material wealth. On the flip side, men are fed toxic messaging that discourages vulnerability, pressures them to become dominant “alpha males”, and promotes manipulative tactics like delaying responses to texts. Take, for instance, the catchy mantra-turned-meme: \"If he wanted to, he would.\" It seems simple — if your partner cared about you, he would act accordingly. But people aren’t that simple. There are dangers that come with attempting to streamline the complexities of human emotions and motivations into a binary equation such as this. Food-related challenges, such as the quirky “orange peel theory” and the more recent “ketchup challenge” — which entails cleaning up spilled ketchup on camera — are designed to test a partner's devotion through trivial tasks. But can we really judge the strength of our relationships based on such arbitrary acts? Creating unnecessary scenarios just to put our partners on display for public scrutiny and judgement is not only dehumanising but also undermines the trust and respect essential for healthy connection and intimacy. It doesn’t help that many young adults are already under implicit pressure to measure the success of many aspects of their lives against what they see on social media. The tendency to compare oneself to others is natural — however, social media amplifies the negative impacts of such comparison, especially among youths who spend a lot of time scrolling through peers' profiles. For young people, repeated exposure to idealised portrayals of love and dating online can create feelings of inadequacy or insecurity, leading to discontent or disappointment in their own relationships. Some of my own friends have gotten caught up in replicating “relationship milestones” to the point where it became all about ticking off certain boxes: Posting perfect couple photos, marking anniversaries in unique, flashy ways, or staging elaborate displays of affection. In chasing these external validations, we risk losing sight of what truly matters: The genuine emotional connection and compatibility we share with our partners. Popular social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram run on algorithms that favour viral content. Trends that promote sensationalised or exaggerated relationship advice often pick up steam quickly and easily, quickly racking up millions of views. But such content often lacks the depth needed to navigate the subjective nature of human relationships. Snappy catch phrases do well with gaining traction on social media, but don't consider personal struggles, communication barriers, geographical locations, or the fact that everyone expresses love differently. Perhaps it’s more useful to view catchy phrases and advice soundbites as food for thought. For example, while TikTok videos of users testing out the orange peel theory saw millions of viewers tuning in, the theory’s popularity seemed to be overwhelmingly limited to girls and women — a group that is typically taught from a young age to prioritise and anticipate others' needs without complaint or concern for our own. Could it be that a seemingly arbitrary request of peeling an orange isn’t showing us if our partner loves us or not, but rather reflecting our own desire for our unvoiced needs to be met? In the midst of the noise, how do we discern what's helpful from what's harmful? Here are some tips that I rely on. Firstly, exercise critical thinking. Consider the content's tone and approach: Who are they speaking to — a generalised group of people, or a specific type of individual in a specific type of situation? Are they promoting healthy communication and mutual understanding, or do they rely on popular but trite wisdom, or deceptively simple solutions? Look for sources backed by professionals, such as licensed therapists, or relationship experts with verifiable credentials. I've personally found a couple of accounts that I really resonate with, like @thesecurerelationship and @your.being. They're run by certified psychologists and relationship experts who offer genuine, evidence-based advice. Lastly, never underestimate the power of open communication and mutual understanding in relationships. Regardless of what strangers are saying, the voice that matters most is that of yours and your partner's. Approach conversations with honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to listen. In the real world, a relationship between two persons demands open communication and mutual understanding, not snap assumptions based solely on actions prescribed by strangers or digital trends. Let's leave the oranges and ketchup in the kitchen, and focus on the real, authentic moments that can strengthen our bonds in a healthy way.

    "article_content": "Commentary Reactions to TODAY's May 12 article on increasingly heated ire among fans of Laufey and Hamilton have thrown oil onto the fire surrounding the rise of dynamic pricing for concerts and live performances in Singapore. This audio is AI-generated. Is surge pricing a reasonable practice to deter scalpers and manage high demand for sales for concerts and live shows in Singapore, or just a cash grab by entertainers and ticketing companies? Dynamic pricing may be a moving target, says this TODAY journalist, but it shouldn't be a shot in the dark for ticket buyers. On May 12, TODAY published an article on increasingly heated ire among attendees of concerts and live performances in Singapore. Fans of Icelandic jazz-pop singer Laufey and popular musical Hamilton were up in arms — not about their favourite acts coming to town, but about the exorbitant prices they were facing on ticket purchase sites due to dynamic pricing . Reactions to the story — penned by yours truly — threw oil onto the fire surrounding the rise of dynamic pricing for such events in Singapore, reigniting the debate on whether such a pricing model is reasonable, or even acceptable. In theory, dynamic pricing means prices will rise when there is high demand, and drop when there is little to no demand. But high demand is typical for such events in Singapore — Taylor Swift fans queued overnight for her tickets outside Singpost and Coldplay’s six shows sold out within hours . Major ticketing and promoter companies claim that dynamic pricing guards against scalping. However, many members of the public see the use of this model as these companies turning into \"scalpers\" themselves, forcing much higher prices onto ticket buyers than usual. Several also questioned if dynamic pricing was the best solution to deal with both high demand and scalpers. They asked: What about a lottery-style sale instead? In lottery-based sales in places such as Japan and Taiwan, tickets are tied to buyers' identity numbers or passport numbers. Some venues do not reveal seat numbers until a few days before the event, making it harder to resell tickets, pointed out netizens. With so much uncertainty around how dynamic pricing will hike up entertainment tickets, some also said they would not attend any event with such a volatile model. Some in this camp predicted that such a pricing model might eventually drive many others away from going to concerts, and warned of dire impacts on Singapore's burgeoning concert industry in the long run. On the other hand, another faction argued that the rage over dynamic pricing for entertainment events was ridiculous. Basically: If you can't afford it, just don't attend. \"Why (are) Singaporeans complaining? A concert is a luxury,\" said one Facebook user. \"Do not chase a lifestyle that (you can't afford).\" Another labelled the use of dynamic pricing for entertainment events a \"rich people problem\". Some called the backlash ironic. After all, they said, dynamic pricing is not new in Singapore. Demand-based pricing has long been commonly used to price services like air travel, food delivery and ride-hailing . A few also agreed with Ticketmaster and other ticketing companies that dynamic pricing is a reasonable way to deal with scalpers. With prices less predictable, scalpers have to take a higher risk when purchasing tickets to resell. Should a scalper purchase a ticket that is too expensive, they may struggle to resell the ticket and end up making a loss, especially if demand falls off sharply after some time. So why should most of us care about how tickets for entertainment events are priced, especially if they are a \"luxury\"? Considering this question, it's important to note that concerts and live performances were not necessarily luxurious goods up until quite recently. In 2003, the most expensive ticket for a joint concert by UK bands Travis and Coldplay in Singapore was S$101. Adjusted for inflation, that's about S$128.39 today. Conversely, Coldplay's most expensive ticket for their 2024 concert here was S$1,098. Of course several factors, including different venues and theatrics used, contribute to pushing prices up over the years. But with dynamic pricing in the mix, concerts might soon become real luxuries most of us won't be able to afford. Should this be the case though? Surely we all deserve to have some fun in our lives — something that helps us break free from the monotony of everyday humdrum. Life should not just be about meeting the basic needs of physical sustenance. Realistically, however, nothing is stopping entertainers, promoters and organisers from implementing dynamic pricing. Hence, the next best thing could be guidelines to ensure consumer rights are protected. One way to go about it? Price transparency. In the case of Laufey's show, other than being told prices were \"starting\" at S$98, fans essentially had to go into the ticket-purchasing process blind. In place of the typical colour-coded seat map with different price categories, this particular all-blue seating map said only that prices started from S$98 and were \"subject to change in accordance with demand\". Some Laufey fans ended up paying upwards of S$268 for a ticket to see the 25-year-old singer perform. While some were willing to spend that sum, many were still upset that there had been no way to know ticket prices in advance until they were well into the seat selection process last Monday and Tuesday during the ticket sales. One fan also told me that they had to skip the concert when they realised the final prices were out of their budget. To make dynamic pricing more equitable, event organisers should maintain the offering of differently priced categories, as well as implement a suitable price cap for each category so consumers can manage their own expectations of what they're willing to pay. Ticket buyers also deserve more clarity on exactly how dynamic pricing is calculated for each event. Additionally, entertainment organisers and promoters should be required to have safeguards in place to prevent bots from artificially inflating demand — or, better yet, not allow bots to access their website at all. Whatever happens, I hope it won't cost me a kidney to see Taylor Swift live the next time she drops by. And if it does, you might find me with one less kidney. Or, more realistically, in “Category 100” — on a picnic mat outside the National Stadium with my organs intact. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Loraine Lee is a journalist at TODAY.

    "article_content": "Commentary I should have known right away that something was seriously wrong. This audio is AI-generated. I should have known right away that something was seriously wrong. The cramps intensified every month. The bleeding increased in quantity. There were moments when, if I walked a little too fast, the world seemed to spin around me. But nothing prepared me for the pains I felt one recent day onboard a train. I thought I would black out from the cramps. I couldn't stand straight. I looked desperately for an empty seat to rest in. I didn’t find one — until the last stop right before my destination station. I took it anyway, urgently needing the few minutes of respite it provided me. Instead of seeking medical help right away, I carried on my way home. It might just be stress, I thought, or a lack of sufficient sleep causing these extreme pains. In hindsight, I wasn’t thinking too clearly. I just wanted to rest. That night, I was rushed to the emergency department for severe abdominal pains. Initial diagnoses of appendicitis and ruptured cysts soon gave way to one: A degenerated fibroid in my womb. It was so big that it had outgrown its blood supply. I had long known that I had fibroids in the womb, and had been making regular visits to the gynaecologist to monitor their growth. Upon further detailed checks, the severe pains which I had experienced were also due to adenomyosis and endometriosis, painful uterine disorders which involve the endometrial tissue of the womb. I was in severe pain despite round-the-clock doses of Arcoxia, a pain and inflammation reliever. Taking the full measure of the situation and the fact that my husband and I had no plans to enlarge our family further, my gynaecologist asked me to consider a hysterectomy. In removing my womb, she promised to preserve my ovaries as there was no medical need to remove them. If she were to remove them, I would enter straight into menopause. Considering my pain and the dire state of my womb, I went ahead with the hysterectomy on May 5. At the time, I thought of it purely as a medical procedure. The pains were so bad that I really wanted to find a solution to ease them. In my mind, this was a purely physical ailment which needed to be removed as soon as possible. Problem solved. However, after the procedure was done, I looked at my clinical discharge summary — and, to my own shock, tears started forming in my eyes. Medical facts stated how bad my womb was, with the enlarged, adenomyotic uterus, numerous endometrial blood clots and fibroids. Strangely, even though such a “bad” part of my body had been removed, I found myself grieving for it. I grieved for the womb which had helped me to sustain two pregnancies and bear two beautiful children. I grieved for the womb which had “failed” to see me through natural menopause. I grieved for a physical part of my being which I had now lost. Was it possible to feel “less” of a woman, having permanently lost my womb and thus the ability to have more children? There were just so many emotions pulsating through me. As I spent time at home recuperating after the procedure, the emotional turmoil continued. I wept. I searched. I prayed. I journalled. I read. I have come to realise that, even though I understood the rationale behind my choice to remove my womb, I needed the time and emotional space to mourn and say goodbye to an integral and dear part of my body. My womb had given us our lovely children. It had fulfilled its task of sustaining life for my babies. Throughout my life, my womb has worked very hard for me — and it had now become medically non-viable to keep within my body. I am thankful. As I emerge from this brief but unexpectedly profound medical episode, I’d like to advocate for two things. First, for my female comrades, it’s so important for you to get connected with a good gynaecologist and undergo regular gynaecological checks. It’s not uncommon for women to feel uncomfortable with gynaecological visits, or to find them unnecessary as they assume such checks are only meant for women who are planning to have children or already have medical issues. Don't ignore even seemingly “small” issues like inter-cycle bleeding, increasingly painful menstrual cramps, or increased bleeding. Especially for women who are planning to have children, make yourself a gynaecological appointment to rule out fibroids and other risks before conceiving, not after having conceived. Thanks to my own kind, reassuring gynaecologist, I was able to feel like I was in very safe hands for such a major surgery. Secondly, let’s strive to normalise conversations and concerns on menstrual concerns. Even in these modern times, I still notice people reacting with visible awkwardness when topics relating to women’s health pop up in everyday exchanges, such as menstrual pains, cramps and bleeding. Women make up half the planet’s population. Menstruation happens once a month to everybody in the world in possession of a uterus who's reached puberty. For a great many of us, it can be deeply uncomfortable and even severely painful. Can we normalise “period leave” for women who might be experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding and find it hard and inconvenient to spend long hours away from home for work? What if we spoke of menstrual cramps and bleeding as if they were like any other physical debilitations and ailments — flus and coughs, for example? How might we care for friends and coworkers undergoing tough menstrual challenges? Could we ask if they need to rest in, need a recommendation for a good gynaecologist, or would like a heating pad to relieve the cramps without fearing crossing archaic taboo lines? For now, as I continue to recover, I am grateful to be able to count on the love of family and friends and the understanding of kind and supportive bosses and colleagues. Within myself, I’m also making peace with this farewell process. I’m learning that it’s possible to embrace both sadness and gratitude, and smile through my tears. Goodbye, my womb. Thank you.

    "article_content": "Commentary On Feb 26, American finance influencer Codie Sanchez posted a tweet discouraging “adults” from asking their friends for a ride to an airport. “Use Uber, save a friendship,” she advised. When did doing favours for each other stop being a social norm? This audio is AI-generated. Should our personal needs always come first? Boundaries can be good for our mental health, says this writer, but we need to be careful that our boundaries do not block us from connecting with those we care about — that “self-care” doesn’t become self-centredness. On Feb 26, American finance influencer Codie Sanchez posted a tweet discouraging “adults” from asking their friends for a ride to an airport. “Use Uber, save a friendship,” she advised in the viral post that generated over 25 million views, 2,500 likes and thousands of responses — both in agreement and disagreement. In the posts and comments agreeing with Ms Sanchez, I was struck to see that so many of us believe we should refrain from extending the simplest, most everyday gestures of kindness to our own friends. It had me wondering: When did doing favours for each other stop being a social norm? In a previous workplace, a colleague helped me purchase a sandwich from 7-Eleven one morning. In return, I stopped by our usual coffee haunt after lunch and bought her an iced drink. When she asked how much she owed me, I waved it off. After all, it was only S$0.99. The smallest of favours. But she insisted and, the next thing I knew, I had S$0.99 more in my PayLah! wallet. A few months later, when someone offered to buy me my favourite teh C, I found myself desperate to repay them the S$2 it cost. This is something they wanted to do for me; I was under no obligation to feel indebted. Even then, I still transferred the S$2. “You can treat me another day,” I laughed in an attempt to hide my inexplicable discomfort. I was used to saying “I’ll get you the next round” to friends and family. The practice of writing off a debt immediately was unfamiliar to me — or even the idea of it being considered a “debt” at all. Why had I suddenly felt this strange pressure to immediately repay this particular gesture? I later found an explanation in political scientist Robert Axelrod’s \"tit for tat” game theory: We tend to reciprocate and mirror an action done towards us, whether positive or negative. That was the impact the S$0.99 transfer had on me: I suddenly felt like any “nice gesture” from others was an imposition by me on them, one that demanded compensation. We’ve all been there before, where asking a favour from a friend felt like we owed half our lives to them. Many times, I’ve instinctively said “I owe you one!”, instead of “thank you”. But it turns out that in general, people want their loved ones to “bother” them, showed a 2022 study published by the American Psychological Association — even though those reaching out may feel the gesture is insignificant. Clearly, it’s important to us to give freely to those around us. The problem is that the capitalist nature of our lives encourages us to view our very selves as a collection of practical resources to be carefully expended. Take time, for instance. How often have we heard that we should be “maximising” our time? So many self-help resources online are about optimising the “5-9” (our time away from work) as best as possible for “productive” endeavours, such as creating a healthy routine. Anything outside this realm — helping a friend run an errand, for example — might detract from or deter our journey towards personal growth or achievement. On top of that, with so much automation and convenience around us, we have the perfect excuse to avoid helping our friends in ways that used to be commonplace, and instead suggest services that would do the same at a monetary cost. With mental health awareness now at the forefront in many aspects of life, we’ve all heard the rhetoric that our personal needs should come first. But have we warped this idea a little too far beyond the original intent of self-care? To be clear, we all need boundaries. Some of these include not being available to our friends after a certain hour, or limiting the emotional support we can provide regarding burdensome or triggering topics. However, we seem to have forgotten that boundaries are meant to protect us from unhealthy situations, not prevent us from investing in healthy bonds with others. We need to be careful that our boundaries do not block us from connecting with those we care about — that “self-care” doesn’t become self-centredness. In The Art of Loving, German social psychologist Eric Fromm stated: “Love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives”. Helping others does not have to come at the cost of our own mental well-being. In fact, when we extend kindness and favours towards others, it can actually alleviate our own symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improve our overall mental health, reported a study published in 2023 by the American Psychiatric Association. Speaking as a Gen Z-er, as much as baby boomers may not understand us on many different principles, there was one thing they got right: Creating communities. The “kampung spirit” of older Singaporeans fostered togetherness and support, which has stood the test of time until today. While many of today’s youth readily avoid orientations or water cooler conversations , boomers are less likely to shy away from gathering together, as understood from countless stories of flourishing community involvement programmes for the elderly. Baby boomers are also more likely to help those around them, knowing that that gesture might not ever get repaid. A 2017 National University of Singapore study showed that the older Singaporeans are, the more inclined they are to volunteer, with senior citizens particularly generous with those who are socially distant. Growing up with my grandmother, I watched her befriend so many of our neighbours and regularly checked in on their and their family’s well-being. Many of these neighbours, I never knew personally — but they would look out for me in the community because of my grandmother. Have we let Singapore’s kampung spirit become a relic of the past? The answer is not yet set in stone — but as we continue to see rising levels of isolation and loneliness, it’s clear that we need to find new ways to support each other, beginning with our friendships. If we want to lay down a foundation of authenticity and trust in our social bonds, we need to be willing to extend kindness to others without requiring or expecting any reciprocation other than gratitude — and also to accept them in kind. Doing favours for our friends isn’t just about putting in effort or going the extra mile — it’s about creating opportunities for pure human connection. Perhaps kickstarting this cultural reset can be as simple as offering a friend a ride to the airport.

Why do so many people complain about how expensive it is to own a car here, but yet still choose to spend thousands of dollars to earn a driving licence when they may never own a car? This audio is AI-generated. Given how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system, this TODAY journalist had never seriously considered getting a driving licence — but recent events have prompted a change of heart, even if he still doesn’t plan to own a car. Whenever the subject of cars comes up in conversations with friends, the same thought always comes to my mind: Is it really necessary to be able to drive in Singapore? Singapore is well-known to have an efficient and world-class public transportation system. Having spent my entire life relying on trains and buses to get around, I’ve always wondered why so many people complain about how expensive it is to own a car here, but yet still choose to spend thousands of dollars to earn a driving licence when they may never own a car. Given how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system is, obtaining a driving licence had never really been something I seriously considered. However, recent events have prompted me to have a change of heart — even if I don’t plan to own a car. Believe it or not, even on a tiny island like Singapore, some places remain relatively inaccessible for public transport users. I vividly recall an instance where I had to attend a social gathering event after work at a certain government building at Mount Pleasant. At first glance, the usually reliable Google Maps told me that it was only less than 10 minutes’ walk from the nearest bus stop. To my horror, the walk led me through an unforgiving uphill slog. It seemed never-ending, especially after spending more than eight hours in the office hunched over a desk. Just a few minutes into this trek, my laptop that I carried in my bag started to feel like it was made of solid rock. By the time I arrived at my destination, I was drenched in sweat. My thighs were aching for days after. Mount “Pleasant”? As if. Hilly mini-route marches aside, even a leisurely visit to some of my favourite downtime destinations these days is still not easy or convenient. East Coast Park is one example, as there are no straightforward ways of getting there using public transport, especially on weekdays. Sure, you can always get anywhere by hopping into a cab or pulling up a ride-hailing app on your phone. But it’s likely fair to say we all have our own nightmare experiences with surge pricing and difficult drivers who refuse to go the extra mile when asked nicely, or even cancel booked rides for no rhyme or reason. Cars bearing car-sharing brand logos are becoming more common a sight on our roads as well as in my own neighbourhood. Even though I can’t use car-sharing, their prevalence has led me to do my own research into why more Singaporeans are turning to them. Flexibility is one key pull factor for me — being able to use the services just for a short trip to a friend’s house at another ulu place or a full day spent running various errands. Affordability is another. Since I would not be a regular road user, the overall cost of renting a car, as opposed to owning one, would be more in my favour. I wouldn’t need to bear costs for maintenance, insurance, taxes and so on. Finally, there’s convenience. Most car-sharing services are accessible through mobile apps — a plus for me, as I already rely upon smartphone apps for most of my daily routine tasks, from setting my alarm, paying for meals and other purchases, to even grocery shopping. Much like any young Singaporean, I love travelling once in a while to get away from the bustling cityscape. I’ve been fortunate enough to witness the breathtaking landscapes of Iceland and Arizona in the United States, among other memorable trips. One thing I’ve never been able to do is a road trip, driving for days on open roads through beautiful natural landscapes with incredible sceneries round every corner. A destination high up on my road-tripping bucket list would be New Zealand. For me, it's just second to Iceland, which I had been to on an organised tour group that did not feel as satisfying as I'd anticipated. I’ll admit: Listening to road trip stories of friends and watching travel videos on social media, the Fomo is starting to set in. Perhaps some places are much better off explored on the road by driving, instead of in a tour bus filled with 20 others. When getting around different places in groups with family and friends, carpooling has been my go-to option most of the time. However, during Hari Raya visitations this year, I noticed the exhaustion setting in on the faces of the full-day drivers tasked with commuting the same group of people from one house to another — a total of seven destinations over at least five hours. Watching them fight off yawn after yawn, I felt a pang of guilt. I wondered: “Would it be better if I gave them a break and took over the wheel for a bit?” While it’s true that situations like these do not occur too often, as I get older, I’m starting to think that it would be nice if I could, once in a while, offer some help with ferrying my relatives around for family events. Having tied the knot not too long ago, images of a possible future with kids in it have started flashing in my head. How would I get a toddler to daycare, and pick him up at the end of the day? Would I want to have my (potentially rowdy) kids running around on a crowded train or bus? If my family were indeed to get bigger, other necessities will also come into play — larger grocery loads, additional furniture, and more. Perhaps in this possible future, the increased practicality and convenience of private modes of transport would be well worth the additional monetary costs. All this considered, it might just be time to step out of my comfort zone at last, and into the driver’s seat. Here's hoping the numerous driving lessons that will be occupying my schedule for the next few months will be a good investment of my time and, more importantly, my money.

    "article_content": "Commentary While I was growing up, my father spent most of his time either working or unwinding at the void deck with his friends. I always yearned to be able to spend more time with him. The author, Raymond Lim (second from right), and his family pictured in June 2023, during a tree planting exercise they participated in. He and his wife, Diane, are currently homeschooling both their children. This audio is AI-generated. As parents, taking on the role of educator to homeschool one's kids can be overwhelming. Here's why this couple feels it's worth the investment and sacrifice. While I was growing up, my father spent most of his time either working or unwinding at the void deck with his friends. Of all my childhood memories, the ones I hold closest to my heart are the times spent with my dad and elder brother after our Sunday swimming lessons where we would share snacks and laugh together. These moments were good, but they never lasted long. I always yearned to be able to spend more time with him. When my wife Diane and I had our first child, we decided that we never wanted our children to feel that sort of yearning. And so, even though we knew it would be a lot of work, we chose the path of homeschooling. Don’t get us wrong: Normal schools and textbooks are great. There’s nothing wrong with a conventional academic path; we just wanted something different for our kids. There are important real-life skills that kids can learn and develop outside of the traditional classrooms. The way we see it, education is not just about knowledge. It's about enabling our son, aged eight, and our daughter, aged four, to develop practical skills and sensibilities that they can carry with them throughout their lives. In our family, I work full-time while my wife focuses on our kids' education. We follow a tailored curriculum that’s approved by the Ministry Of Education suited to each child's learning needs and pace. Outside of work, I join my kids for playtime and as many of their non-academic learning activities as I can, such as nature exploration, communications and speaking skills, as well as sports. We allocate budget, time and energy to ensure that each aspect of family life receives attention and resources. We plan and decide together which parent will take care of specific needs and oversee learning outcomes across different areas. Keeping our kids engaged in a wide range of activities outside the home allows them to develop their social skills through continuous interaction with other children and adults, regardless of age, location and background. With other homeschooling families, we share experiences and participate in activities such as swimming classes, art classes, sports development, science experiences and events, and communication and speaking skills. The children also have academic sessions with other homeschooled kids close to them in age. We often go camping and explore outdoor places like the Botanic Gardens, Zoo, Night Safari, and Gardens by the Bay. These outings allow us to learn about flora and fauna, as well as animal life such as insects and otters. We also participate in various cultural activities throughout the year, such as Hari Raya celebrations, Deepavali festivities where we learn to make prata, Lantern Festivals with dragon boat races, and Eurasian cultural gatherings. These don’t just provide opportunities for cultural appreciation; they also help us make diverse connections with others in our community. We also incorporate something called “world-schooling”: We take our kids with us when we travel for work, so they can learn from different places, peoples, and cultures. Taking them out of their comfort zones presents them with opportunities to grow and learn in their own way. Planning and organisation are tightropes we must always balance upon as we strive to maintain routines for our kids and family. We've found that our kids thrive on routines while also benefiting from creativity and real-life experiences. We have an inside joke that on any given week, my wife and kids are busier than me because of their studies, learning excursions, and other activities. My son, for example, has been enjoying soccer in our local community with Active SG (Sports) Soccer for the past three to four years and is now part of the local youth league. He is also involved in canoe polo at Passion Waves programmes. Outside of academics and extracurriculars, children face a lot of challenges today that we as parents and caregivers may not be aware of, such as bullying and peer pressure. As a coach and speaker, I strive to empower and support my kids by utilising some of my coaching and training techniques to boost their confidence and foster self-esteem building. More than knowing the right answers to science and maths questions, it’s important to me that my kids learn how to make the right choices when they encounter difficult personal and social situations as well. As the children progress to more advanced levels of schooling, the workload also becomes greater and more complex for the educator parent. Being part of a support group with past references to proper teaching content and guidance (both at the parents' and kids' level) will be beneficial for us to tackle any challenges or needs on the ground. It truly takes a village to raise a child, and this community, where we can give and share with other like-minded parents and caregivers, is an invaluable resource for us as we strive towards our learning goals. Our aim now is to complete Primary School Leaving Examination learning for both our kids under homeschooling. Planning for secondary school and beyond will require us to reassess when our eldest completes the equivalent of Primary 4. Of course, homeschooling isn’t for every family. For starters, it requires plenty of time and dedication from one parent as an educator. This parent, who must be a degree holder, must be willing and able to put their career on extended hold. As such, another major point of deliberation and discussion is whether the family can support themselves financially, whether on a single full-time income stream or with one or both parents on a much more flexible work schedule. For parents who are considering homeschooling, it’s also important to keep in mind that taking on the role of educator for one’s kids is not simply about following a curriculum. It’s a full-time investment in your child’s academic and personal development — you become parent, teacher, principal, administrator, disciplinarian, co-curricular activities supervisor, counsellor and more, all at the same time. This can be overwhelming at times, and you may not always be able to take a break when you need it. For us, we’ve found that it’s a trade-off worth making for the chance to spend more time with our children, which was our original intention. I’m proud of the relationship I have with my son, where we can talk openly about anything and everything — so different from the one I had with my own father. At the end of the day, homeschooling is an unconventional journey with unique challenges, but if my wife and I had a choice, we’d definitely choose it all over again.

    "article_content": "Commentary In my middle age, I find myself continually slapped with life’s unpopular labels: Divorcee, job-hopper and, about seven months ago — cancer patient. This audio is AI-generated. A breast cancer diagnosis was but another curveball the author has experienced. She describes why she kept it hush-hush for months but found herself feeling like an imposter at work. In my middle age, I find myself continually slapped with life’s unpopular labels: Divorcee, job-hopper and, about eight months ago — cancer patient. Last October, I spent my 49th birthday having a radioactive drug called a tracer injected into a vein in my arm, which induced a cold sensation moving up my arm. I had to wait 60 minutes for the tracer to be absorbed by my body. Next, I had to lie on a narrow table that slid into a scanner that looked like a giant doughnut hole. I was told to hold very still for the next 40 minutes, during which the machine made deafening buzzing, clicking and clanging noises. At the end of the nauseating ordeal, the scans threw up bright spots on my right breast. The verdict was in: I have cancer. It was also Breast Cancer Awareness month. The next couple of weeks were a blur of tears, confusion, and shock. But as a seasoned individual with high-functioning anxiety, I made medical decisions for myself swiftly, and lunged at the procedures the doctors had laid out for me. These included a two-hour lumpectomy, five days of radiotherapy treatments, and long-term use of Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator medication I must continue taking for the next five years. This was a harrowing experience even for a mid-lifer who has been served many of life’s health curveballs including uterine fibroids, insomnia and, currently, perimenopause. But life goes on. I’m only halfway to the end, if the 100-year-life is indeed a thing. I started 2024 as a caregiver to myself and resigning from a promising career at the Agency for Integrated Care, one I had worked hard to kickstart. It was particularly meaningful to me because I liked engaging with seniors, I could apply my newly minted Masters of Applied Gerontology from the Singapore University of Social Sciences, and importantly, I was finally at a level (assistant director) which was closest to what I’d previously earned in the corporate world. I ushered in Chinese New Year with muted enthusiasm, largely from the bad news of cancer, but in part because I had to abstain from my all-time favourite, bak kwa. Post-cancer, the oncologists’ orders were that I had to exercise more, eat less fatty food, and think happy thoughts. Anatomically, I was no different from before. Physically, I tired more easily. Emotionally, I was a mess. Over the next few months, I went through rehabilitation and counselling services at the Singapore Cancer Society. Twice a week, I attended “Strength Training ABC” (After Breast Cancer) sessions, as well as diet and nutritional consultations. The multi-disciplinary care team at the Singapore Cancer Society — receptionists, exercise trainers, social workers, counsellors, dieticians and doctors —provided excellent integrated and holistic care for me, helping me rebuild my body, mind, and soul with buoying cheer. Eventually, I got mentally and emotionally stronger. I decided to look for a job and found Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL). Having spent 23 years of my career as a corporate storyteller, I am still finding my footing and niche in the social services sector. Since crossing over in 2020, thanks to the open-minded hiring managers that I encountered in Rainbow Centre, Tsao Foundation and CAL, I have had the opportunity to work with persons living with autism and multiple disabilities, seniors, and, presently, caregivers to loved ones with mental health issues and dementia. I feel like an imposter in my current place of work because they are unaware — or at least I’ve not told them — about the Big C. But neither did I conceal the truth. I indicated “divorced” in the employment application form, and during the pre-employment check-up, I informed the doctor that I had recently undergone surgery, radiotherapy treatment and am on breast cancer medication. My therapist at Singapore Cancer Society questioned my need to withhold this information at work. We dedicated several sessions analysing my conundrum. In the end, the truth emerged: I wanted to be judged for my competence at work, and not my cancer. While I was comfortable being vulnerable with friends, family and colleagues, I wasn’t open to pity from everyone. I was reluctant to have my doting aunts — all in their 70s — worry about me when they have health and ageing issues of their own. I didn’t want to be a burden to others. And so, I was able to share the news only with my inner circle. (Many will read this commentary and be shocked.) Even though I have my reasons for keeping my health status under wraps, I feel like an imposter at work because many of my colleagues in CAL are caregivers or persons in recovery. At least three colleagues are caregivers to siblings with schizophrenia. At least another three are caregivers to parents with dementia or depression. A handful other colleagues are recovering from anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Some have even openly shared their experiences of past suicide attempts. Worse, in my role in communications, I encourage caregivers who have benefitted from CAL’s caregivers-to-caregivers training programme to step out, tell their stories, and advocate for mental health and caregiving, to reduce the stigma around mental health. Perhaps the biggest guilt trip came in early May, when we launched CAL 4 Mental Wellness, an annual campaign to promote mental health awareness and caregiving and fundraise to support and empower mental health caregivers. In this campaign, we call these caregivers “Hidden Heroes”. The irony is not lost on me. A couple of weeks ago, I received an invitation to attend an event commemorating the inaugural Cancer Survivors’ Day by the Singapore Cancer Society. The event took place on June 1. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, patron of the society, was the guest of honour. Counselling and CAL have both helped to build up my confidence and to realise, after this much-needed adjustment period, that my cancer diagnosis does not define me. With these things falling into place, this invitation seemed to pull the trigger on the starting gun for me. I’ve decided that I am now ready, eight months on, to step into my light and live my truth. Cancer may have taken a small lump from my breast, but it has given me renewed perspective and purpose. I live my life in fast-forward now, focusing on meaningful pursuits that make me happy. Strange as it may seem, cancer has become not a death sentence for me, but a new lease on life.

Of all the apparatus I have tried, my pole videos often stand out in terms of the responses they elicit from viewers both in Singapore and abroad. “You are just showing too much skin!” some viewers would often remark. Many also believe that pole dance is an indecent or lewd activity, close or if not equivalent to stripping. This continues to be a common misconception, as most people associate pole dancing with sleazy situations and settings as seen in TV and movies or in real life performed in places such as night clubs or bars. Before I enrolled in pole dancing classes, my own mother frowned upon the idea of immersing myself in a dance genre that is overly sexualised and possibly provocative, one usually practised or performed while skimpily clad. Despite my interest in trying out pole, I myself was somewhat hesitant to do it regularly. It was a strange, unfamiliar feeling for me to be wearing so much less than usual. I was also troubled by what others would think: What if people thought I was promiscuous or morally loose based on what I wear while doing pole? Or just for doing pole at all? However, I quickly saw that most pole dancers keep their skin as bare as they do in order to grip the pole safely, especially during climbs and inversions. If one wears long-sleeved tops or long bottoms such as pants or leggings, it can be rather slippery on the pole, leading to poor grip and consequent slips and falls. This is extremely dangerous, and can even result in severe head injuries if one happens to fall from an upside-down position. On top of that, I learnt that moisturisers and barrier creams on the skin are also a big no-no before pole practice. One really has to leave the skin “bare” in the most literal sense, with absolutely nothing on it. As I explored pole dancing more, I began to understand that it’s not at all equivalent to stripping. It also dawned on me that not all pole dances are equal. There is a plethora of styles and genres available to choose from. These include lyrical pole where sequences are usually done with bare feet, appear contemporary and accompanied with soothing music, as well as exotic pole, where dancers often wear high heels and incorporate floor work and shoulder stands on the ground. On the other hand, if one prefers to focus on pole fitness rather than dance elements like myself, one can simply aim to attain a particular shape on the pole and forgo all the rhythmic or musical elements of dance. Pole really is a whole world, one that most people know so little about because of preconceived notions. The first few reactions to my pole videos came from friends, who asked if I would be attracting the “wrong” kind of attention. Yet, venturing into the world of pole practice made me feel young, healthy and happy. Wouldn’t it be a waste if I chose to limit myself due to others’ biases? I soon realised that what is appropriate can differ based on perspective. Is it “appropriate” to dress modestly but dangerously for a pole sequence full of inversions and leg hangs? Or is it “appropriate” to attend barefoot an exotic pole class that stipulates heels as a requirement? After all, what is truly appropriate in the practice of any activity should not be determined by third-party spectators, but by what the practitioner feels suits him or her, that helps in the effective execution of said activity safely and comfortably. The pole community is a supportive one, both online and in real life, and many pole influencers often post reels to illustrate why they need to dress a certain way to maintain their grip on the pole. Some even post funny reactions to viewers’ comments that ask or even lecture them to dress appropriately, for example, by performing pole routines while deliberately wearing loud mascots outfits of cartoons and animals to retaliate against strangers’ attempts to shame them or control what they wear. Over time, I felt less and less of a need to constantly explain myself and what I wear in my pole videos, or to pull back on my involvement in this particular activity just because others did not understand the nature of it and the dressing needs associated with it. People can be quick to judge and form their own conclusions about an unconventional activity or sport, even if they have little or imperfect information about it. We cannot control how other might think. However, we can educate and inform. Pole influencers such as Claire Bear Polerina do this by creating reels to demonstrate how she slips from a pole when wearing long-sleeved clothing, as compared to being able to maintain good grip with bare skin on a pole. However, regardless of efforts to inform others, we have to accept that their viewpoints are ultimately up to them. It’s up to each of us to hold our ground even when we face disapproval or negative judgement from others. The lens of our personal perspectives can become clouded by stigma and misconceptions, and that’s part and parcel of life. But our choices belong to us alone, and we have the freedom and agency to choose what is safe and suitable for ourselves. Now, after seeing how much confidence, physical strength and flexibility I’ve gained through pole, my mother enjoys watching my Instagram reels. She even enjoys watching pole reels almost as much as I do now. To me, she is proof that, with time and information, anyone can alter their staunch viewpoints and long-held stigma. Even so, I know it’s not possible for me to be able to get approval from everyone on everything I want to do, both in the pole studio and outside of it. All the same, I hope that we as a society strive less to criticise others and more to acknowledge that everyone has the right to decide what to do with their own body, even though we may not understand or agree personally.

    "article_content": "Commentary A few weeks ago, my son had an unfortunate accident, and we found ourselves spending the night at the hospital where there were no books. To soothe his anxiety and discomfort, I pulled up an artificial intelligence app on my phone. For centuries, bedtime stories have served as a universal language of love and connection between parents and children. This audio is AI-generated. While modern discussions about artificial intelligence often revolve around efficiency, power, and intelligence, this marketing professional's recent experience with his son has prompted him to consider how the tech can provide peace and warmth in unexpected moments. A few weeks ago, my son had an unfortunate accident, and we found ourselves spending the night at the hospital where there were no books. You can imagine how children might feel a sense of anxiety, not being in their own bed. To soothe his anxiety from the injury and discomfort of not being in his own bed, I pulled up an artificial intelligence (AI) app on my phone. Within minutes, a complete story was generated featuring him as the main character, soundtracked by soft music in the background, and tailored around his favorite theme — dinosaurs. This turned out to be our best bedtime story in ages. It wasn't just because of AI. It was the giggles we shared debating who the villain in the tale would be. (Spoiler alert: It wasn't him.) He didn't watch the screen; he just listened to me reading the AI story and the music playing. For centuries, bedtime stories have served as a universal language of love and connection between parents and children. Bedtime stories spark imaginations, soothe anxieties, and create unique memories. Think about it: I’m sure you can name your favorite book from when you were a child. While modern discussions about AI often revolve around efficiency, power, and intelligence, this recent experience with my son has prompted me to consider how AI can provide peace and warmth in unexpected moments. The origins of bedtime stories can be traced back to the early days of human civilisation. In ancient Greece, people would tell stories of gods and heroes at night. In ancient India, people would recite the Vedas and other sacred texts at night as a way of transmitting religious knowledge and wisdom. As civilisations developed, these oral traditions evolved into written forms, which were further democratised by the invention of mass print. The first time the term “bedtime stories” publicly appears is in Bed-Time Stories by American poet Louise Chandler Moulton, published in 1873. AI-generated stories won’t replace traditional bedtime stories anytime soon Today, many cultures around the world still leverage bedtime stories to share creation myths and natural phenomenon explanations. These stories, passed down through generations, connect children to their ancestors' worldview and foster a sense of belonging. They're a cornerstone of cultural identity, shaping how little ones understand the(ir) universe. AI-generated stories can be new and exciting, which make them a valuable addition to intimate exchanges once in a while. But they lack that inherent cultural touch, which means they likely won't replace traditional tales passed down in families through generations. Instead, the bedtime story is one example of how the AI-driven future might be a blend of both personal sentiment and technological progress, where the latter elevates the former. Here’s how: One other area where AI has the potential to strengthen parent-child bonds is in its ability to augment learning experiences. On May 13, OpenAI unveiled its new version of ChatGPT, which can deliver personalised learning experiences by asking interactive questions and ensuring understanding at each stage of a math problem. Watching the video demonstration, what struck me wasn’t the learning feature, but the bonding between a father and son as they interacted and discussed to find solutions, supported by a voice-activated ChatGPT to nudge them in the right direction. AI can never replace the comfort of a mother's voice or that worn copy of Goodnight Moon. But in those unexpected moments, like a hospital stay without a children's book, having an AI app on your phone can be a saving grace. That night, what my son was asking for wasn't really a story, but comfort in the form of a new adventure to share with his dad — one where he would be the hero and a T. rex would be his best friend. I've designed a free web app, webstories.ai, just for that: Creating a story in children’s favorite themes. In moments like this, the ability to create a personalised adventure that resonates with your child's imagination can be a lot of fun. Over time, AI will gradually play a bigger role in our lives. If we can embrace this blend of tradition and innovation, I believe the bond between parent and child will blossom in new ways with AI, fostering shared learning and bonding, and other enriching experiences.

    "article_content": "Commentary Three years ago, I wrote a commentary about my journey as a stay-at-home dad, including both the drudgery and the delight of watching up close my sons’ growth and development. Being in a community of stay-home dads has been a masterclass for Kelvin Seah Lee Nguon, teaching him the importance of not walking difficult paths alone. This audio is AI-generated. In this day and age, much of society still views and treats stay-home fathers differently, making it hard for these men to seek support. This is why The Ordinary Dad was started: As a place for stay-home dads to connect and share about their struggles. Here's what group member Kelvin Seah Lee Nguon learnt about the power of community to transform lives for the better. Three years ago, I wrote a commentary about my journey as a stay-at-home dad, including both the drudgery and the delight of watching up close my sons’ growth and development. Who knew that commentary would trigger a series of events with far greater ripple effects than I could have ever imagined? Back then in June 2021, Dr Tam Wai Jia wrote a follow-up piece to mine the very next week. In it, she championed the roles of stay-at-home dads like her husband and me, and our life-altering decision to be main caregivers to our kids. I didn’t know her at the time, but we later connected over social media. I soon got to know her husband as well, whom I started meeting up with every month to talk candidly about the ups and downs of our journeys as stay-at-home dads. After commiserating together for nearly two years, we had our very first expanded meeting in March 2023 where four more stay-at-home dads showed up to chat with us about their parenting experience. This fledgling community has now grown to over 45 members, and was even briefly featured in a CNA documentary in February this year. To grow from six to over 45 members in 15 months is no mean feat for an organic, ground-up movement that started with just two fathers. When this community of stay-at-home dads first met, one of the first things I noticed was how we were all so different. Most were in their 30s and 40s, but we also had a few dads in their 50s (like me) and one over 60. Some were still working part-time or running their own business full-time from home, while others were taking a break from the rat race, with plans to return to full-time work soon. Despite these differences, it was clear each of us shared one thing in common: We prioritised family above everything else, and were focused on raising our kids the best way we could. It was also clear just how “ordinary” we were — which is why we call ourselves The Ordinary Dad. In The Ordinary Dad, conversations often revolve around all things domestic and parenting: From best practices for potty training, to school and homework routines, to meals we prepare or home appliances we repair. We even talk about the best ways to control pest infestation, while simultaneously gushing over someone’s home aquarium or ant farm. But, men being men, we also talk a lot about sports and games, politics, current affairs, and business. We uplift and spur one another on in our parenting journeys, in ways I have never experienced with other guys my age. One dad told me about a memorable incident with his four-year-old, at his extended family celebration of Mother's Day last month. The boy, who usually pouts at large gatherings, suddenly greeted his mum with a jolly “Happy Mother's Day!” at the top of his lungs. This made everyone smile and his mother's heart melt, even after the little boy started wishing everyone in the room the same, including people who weren’t even mothers. In the days since, when the child misbehaves, this father now recalls that Mother's Day incident and is able to exchange annoyance for delight instead. Another dad shared that one evening, as he was coaxing his three-year-old son to sleep, an impromptu conversation ensued, and soon he found himself chit-chatting with his son like never before. In that moment, it was as if his kid had transformed instantly from a toddler to a young man. This father found himself enjoying the moment so much, he forgot the frustrating day he’d just had as a stay-at-home dad. He shared with our community that he looked forward to more such conversations in the years ahead. What makes our little community work? Firstly, we recognise our vulnerabilities as men who have stepped away from what’s still widely deemed to be a conventional fathering role — being the main breadwinner. Much of society views and treats us differently because of our counter-cultural choice to be stay-at-home fathers. If we were to suppress the vulnerabilities we have in this role, or even internalise for ourselves such societal prejudices, we run a greater emotional and relational risk to ourselves and our families. And so, instead of soldiering on by ourselves in isolation, we openly share our need for help with one another in our community. We talk openly about our parenting struggles and how our children push us to the limits of our patience and tolerance. To this end, having a safe, non-judgmental space in which stay-at-home dads can commiserate helps in no small way. Secondly, we are all journeying through the daily realities of being stay-at-home dads — and, to us, that journey is of equal if not greater value than the “destination” of raising kids well. While we do sometimes offer up practical solutions for each other’s issues, that’s not the raison d'etre for our community. For us, what often makes for a greater impact is simply being able to open up to other dads who can resonate with and value the experiences and empathies shared. In doing so, we are able to draw strength and comfort to get us through the most trying of days. Though The Ordinary Dad meets once a month in person to chat and connect, our conversations don’t end there. Between these monthly meetings, we continue to communicate online as well as in smaller, breakout groups that meet voluntarily face-to-face, either because of shared interests and hobbies, or proximity in terms of where we live, or our kids’ ages — or just because we happen to click with each other. These small-group exchanges happen organically, with no expectations, fixed routines or schedules. Our only desire is to connect, encourage each other, and share our lives. Over the past 15 months, we have become important pillars and sources of comfort and hope for one another in this hectic world, especially when the parenting journey gets tough and we feel like we’re on the edge of losing our sanity. All in all, this group has been a masterclass for me, teaching me the importance of not walking difficult paths alone and the power of community to transform each of our lives for the better. To all my fellow fathers out there, whether you’re a working dad or a stay-at-home one, here’s wishing you a Happy Father’s Day!

    "article_content": "Commentary Is more always better? Or are young Singaporeans launching themselves into the rat race too early? This audio is AI-generated. Young Singaporeans are stacking internships in a bid to stand out as competition heats up in the job market — but are the real fruits of their efforts going entirely to companies that benefit from their cheap labour? While the pressure may be real, says this TODAY journalist, youths should take care they don't wear themselves out before they even join the rat race. Is more always better? Eating too much food could give you a bad stomachache. Buying too many clothes means having less to spend or save. Taking on too much work is a one-way road to burnout. So is there such a thing as \"too many\" internships? A growing number of students have joined the internship arms race , with some taking as many as 10 internships in two years, reported TODAY reported on Friday (June 14). This phenomenon sparked some debate online, with many wondering if young people are launching themselves into the rat race too early. In TODAY's latest Big Read penned by yours truly, the young people said that they had taken on multiple internships for various reasons, such as to increase their chances of landing a better job or to gain more real-world experience — but largely because they're worried about standing out with the intense competition in the job market. Their concerns had some readers lamenting the situation and wondering if the young are falling victim to peer pressure. Someone on online forum Reddit, for example, wrote about having two interns who took on multiple internships during their school term but each still had plans for another internship once their summer break started. \"The whole team tried to convince them to chill and take it easy during (university) like we did,\" this Reddit user said, \"but I guess this arms race mentality is hard to break cause of fomo (fear of missing out).\" Another online user, who implied that he or she is now studying at a university, pointed out that most young people don't have much of a choice when it comes to that sense of fomo, because taking on internships is a requirement to graduate in most institutes of higher learning. \"I would love for nothing more than to actually travel for extended periods during my summer breaks, but I have to intern for the credits and for the resume,\" the online user said. Several said that, left unchecked, this intensifying sense of pressure and competition could send young people down a never-ending spiral, eventually playing an active role in worsening mental health struggles for this generation. On the other hand, another camp of responders said that the real winners of young Singaporeans' growing internship addiction are corporations that benefit from their cheap labour. After all, though not all firms are paying peanuts — some investment banking firms have reportedly offered internship salaries of up to S$10,000 — interns are generally paid less than their full-time counterparts. The National University of Singapore recommends an allowance of at least S$800 to S$1,000, for example. This is a fraction of the median gross monthly salary for fresh graduates in full-time permanent employment of S$4,313, based on the 2023 Joint Autonomous Universities Graduate Employment Survey. Pay aside, several people said it is more important that students have a quality internship experience rather than allowing themselves to be roped into an endless grind. One online user said: \"Employers, 'success' influencers and bigwigs are 100 per cent snickering with glee at what they've created — a race for youngsters to be taken advantage o... If you get an internship make sure you're getting something out of it.\" Another online user said that internships are not like Pokemon in that you don't need to catch 'em all: \"Spamming low-value (internships) only serve to dilute your real achievements instead.\" Most readers, though, acknowledged that internships do have their benefits: They help the youth discover their interests, strengths and working styles while gaining hands-on experience in real workplaces. Third-party opinions aside, perhaps the real crux of the internship arms race is that many Singaporean youth seem to be missing the point of internships. Instead of learning opportunities, a growing number of the young appear to be taking these as a way to one-up their peers in the job hunt by lengthening their resumes, rather than strengthening them. This mindset speaks to an overblown ideal of what a first job should be: High-paying position in a reputable company with countless work benefits, perhaps a fully stocked pantry and a Herman Miller chair at a desk in a building that forms part of Singapore's iconic skyline. However, realistically, a first job isn't the last job for most of these young people. There is still plenty of time and opportunity for them to work their way up the corporate ladder after they start their first full-time job, or even their second. Most schools have a mandatory graduation requirement of at least one internship, and that experience can be enough if it is fruitful. Beyond this, if young people want to take on multiple internship stints to explore their preferences and prospects, that's totally up to them. However, internships shouldn't be an internment — people should do it for reasons that will truly help them grow and find their way, and not just because they feel trapped by external or perceived pressures. If there's anything I have learnt from my own experience in the working world, preparing for any race is just as important as running the race itself — you shouldn't exhaust yourself before you graduate and join the rat race.

    "article_content": "Commentary Up until January of this year, I was the co-owner of two restaurant bars. I say “was” because both establishments have closed down, within a few months of each other. A photo from April 2023 of the author's food-and-beverage establishments. Both businesses are now shuttered. This audio is AI-generated. When the iconic Thambi Magazine Store closed on May 5, many took to the Internet to lament the loss of a pillar of Singapore’s retail landscape and history. But when was the last time any of us actually handed over cash for a magazine there? Perhaps instead of waiting for nostalgia to bring out the best in us, it’s time to put our money where our mouths are, says this former business owner. Up until January of this year, I was the co-owner of two restaurant bars. I say “was” because both establishments have closed down, within a few months of each other. The rate of business closures in Singapore has been ramping up in recent years, from 50,423 closures in 2022 to 51,763 in 2023, data shows from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. Most recently, there has been a bit of a hoo-ha around the closure of Thambi Magazine Store, an iconic newsstand along Lorong Liput in Holland Village. From the day the news was announced right up till the store’s closure on May 5, many took to the Internet to lament the loss of a pillar of Singapore’s retail landscape and history. Op-eds and articles were published, and social media platforms flowed over with netizens reminiscing about their experiences buying magazines and books at Thambi when they were younger. I myself have fond memories of buying Archie Comics from that very store. But when was the last time any of us actually handed over cash for a magazine there? In the aftermath of my own business closures, for my partners and I, the question that kept popping up in conversations with others was why we closed. It seemed to me that the answer was obvious: We were losing a substantial amount of money each month. It’s a well-known fact that times are tough and are only getting tougher, amid rising costs, reduced spending power and manpower constraints. Of course, there are always a few possible reasons why a business might be closing. The owner could be retiring, for example. Or perhaps the lease for the venue where the business operates is up for renewal, and the owner wants to do something different. But one underlying theme generally covers the majority of closures: There’s just not enough revenue. Witnessing the closure of a cherished spot can bring a profound sense of loss. It's more than just a venue; it’s the backdrop to our community and connections. We read about a historic restaurant bowing out and say: “So sad, we had our first date here.” We hear the news about a neighbourhood beauty store shuttering and think: “What a pity; I bought my first lip gloss from there.” But when was the last time you got dinner from the hole-in-the-wall restaurant where you had your first date with your partner? Or picked up lipstick from the family-run beauty store by your house, instead of pulling up Shopee on autopilot? Waxing lyrical about times past can give us an emotional kick — but for those involved in such businesses, our memories don’t do much to make them money. Of course, the restaurant or shop has to provide some sort of continued value to you. There are always many new entrants in any market, and also those who continue to survive and prosper. Changes and closures are inevitable — it’s part of the business circle of life. Consumers’ needs and wants change over time, and businesses have to be adaptable enough to stick around. It's easy to think that one’s customers will always be there, but it’s a customer’s prerogative to continue patronising a shop or not. Businesses have to work for it. On my own failed ventures, people often ask me if I would do it all over again if I could turn back time. My honest answer is “no”. No, I would not do it again. Running any business is demanding. Not just financially, but physically, mentally and emotionally as well. Having to close a business is another thing altogether. Making such a final decision involves a significant amount of stress for all involved, not to mention sadness and disappointment. Someone said to me just a couple weeks ago: “No problem lah. Start over again.” I understand that they might have been trying to encourage me, to help me look ahead instead of dwelling on pains of the past. However, it’s hard to ignore that trite comments such as these can often belittle the overwhelming amounts of time, money and energy local business owners pour into their ventures to keep them afloat. In this climate, we can afford to be more thoughtful and sensitive about our reactions and responses to the closure of any business, whether we know the people involved or not. There’s a famous quote from the Harry Potter series: “It is our choices that show us who we truly are, far more than our abilities.” In this day and age, change is happening faster than ever. Books and magazines have moved online; new fads about food and drink, clothing and more pop up on social media practically on a weekly basis. But one thing that won’t change anytime soon is that we each have the choice to support our local businesses — by giving them money in exchange for goods and services, rather than lamenting their imminent deaths on social media. Perhaps instead of waiting for nostalgia to bring out the best in us, it’s time to put our money where our mouths are.

The Causeway during evening peak hour on Feb 29, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at Malaysia's concerns about its brain drain, particularly to Singapore, and what is at stake for both countries and their workers. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Despite having a successful sales career, a workplace with supportive colleagues, and a stable relationship in Malaysia, Ms Anna Chin still felt something was missing. And so, like many of her fellow compatriots with big dreams, the Malaysian started considering looking southwards: Singapore. “I got hold of an opportunity from a recruiter, which made me contemplate whether moving to Singapore would be a good decision. “Since Singapore and Malaysia have similar cultures, food, and languages, I thought it would be nice to have the opportunity to work overseas but in a place that doesn’t feel too different from home,” the Ipoh native told TODAY. Ms Chin, who holds a bachelor’s degree in science, thought she could benefit from the regional experience. She had expected to stay in Singapore for just a few years and then head home. Fast forward to six years later, the 33-year-old medical sales executive is now a Singapore permanent resident, happily married to a Singaporean, and is in the market for a flat as her forever home here. Considering how her life had taken an unexpected turn since she uprooted herself, Ms Chin said she plans to have children and settle down in Singapore for good. Ms Chin’s experience will surely resonate with the Malaysian diaspora residing and working in Singapore. Last year, Malaysia's then Human Resources Minister V Sivakumar, said that as of 2022, 1.13 million out of 1.86 million Malaysians who migrated abroad were living in Singapore. While Singapore alone absorbs over 60 per cent of Malaysia’s diaspora, most of the remainder reside in countries located on the other side of the world, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. A Malaysia governmental study conducted in 2022 and released on Feb 19 this year revealed that more than half of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore have tertiary-level qualifications. Nearly three in four, or 74 per cent, are skilled and semi-skilled workers. On career planning, 62 per cent of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore polled said they would continue working abroad, while the remainder voted for “no” or “not sure”. The study also found that most Malaysians tend to work in Singapore for at least three years, with 33.2 per cent staying for three to five years. A media statement released by the Malaysian authorities about the study warned of the “adverse effects” of the brain drain as skilled workers leave the country. The study was conducted by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, an agency under the Prime Minister’s Department, and the Ministry of Economy. Recruitment agencies told TODAY that there is high demand in manufacturing, engineering, hospitality, healthcare and education sectors for Malaysian workers, as Singapore employers grapple with rising costs and manpower shortage. “Malaysian candidates are often considered the next-best alternative to other nationalities due to the culture and language, which are the closest to Singapore,\" said Mr Jim Wee, director of Singapore-based recruitment firm Nala Employment. Singapore employers TODAY spoke to echoed these sentiments. Mr Keith Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Crown Digital, a tech startup behind Singapore’s first robot barista Ella, said he had difficulties hiring locally due to the limited talent pool and high labour cost. So he chose to hire from Malaysia. “A fresh graduate from NTU (Nanyang Technology University) demanded a pay of S$6,500. The high labour cost in Singapore makes business operations unsustainable, as workers often seek substantial pay increases after a year,” he said. “I am looking to Malaysia because of a larger talent pool that does not come at a ‘premium’ cost... The top graduates are very similar to Singapore. (We speak the) same language, and we are neighbours,” he said. With Singapore being the preferred work destination for Malaysians looking to work abroad, Malaysia's chief statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in his statement accompanying the government study that Malaysia needs to reframe the narrative around brain drain by turning it into \"brain circulation\". “This shift in perspective means that the Malaysian diaspora will eventually return to Malaysia after a predetermined period, thereby contributing their acquired expertise and experiences back to the country,” he said. He said the brain drain issue is bound to have an adverse financial effect, especially considering a significant portion of those employed abroad had received their education in Malaysia. Malaysia and Singapore economists whom TODAY spoke to said that Malaysia’s brain drain has not reached a dire level yet, but the effects would still be felt in the long term. If left unchecked, the continuous loss of talent would eventually hamper economic growth. Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng said the outflow to Singapore had not adversely affected the labour market supply, as the country's manpower needs are still being met. He also said that Malaysia’s current “brain drain” may not be as bad as those experienced during the 1970s and 1980s due to its labour surplus. “It is nevertheless concerning as the outflow of talents could dent the country’s structural upgrading to a higher value, innovation-driven and knowledge-based economy.” “In the longer term, the loss of talents could hamper the country’s aspiration to be an advanced and high-income nation,” said Dr Yeah, who is one of the five advisers to Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance. Associate Professor Alwyn Lim, from the Singapore Management University, echoed Dr Yeah’s sentiments, saying that Malaysia’s population is “large enough” to mitigate any economic impact from migrating skilled workers. Malaysia has an estimated population of 33.7 million, compared with Singapore’s 5.92 million. However, he noted that the economic contributions of nearly a million Malaysian workers are not insignificant. “Many workers in Malaysia can perform lower-skilled work, so the more concerning trend would be higher-skilled Malaysians who choose to work in Singapore, or elsewhere, whose skills cannot be easily replaced and whose value contributions to the economy may be higher. “Higher-skilled Malaysian migration will probably continue to increase, and this will be a limitation for those domestic sectors in Malaysia that rely on the value contribution of higher-skilled Malaysians,” he said. While Singapore seems to be reaping the economic benefits from Malaysia’s flow of skilled and semi-skilled talent into the country, economists also told TODAY that not everything would be rosy in the long run as the two will need each other to do well in order to thrive. Associate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that with Malaysia's and Singapore's economies closely intertwined, the success of one economy often mirrors the success of the other. “Take, for instance, firms headquartered in Singapore that conduct operations in Malaysia. A weak Malaysian economy could directly impact their profitability.” Similarly, Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic adviser at financial service provider CGS International, said that due to the strong intra-regional trade in the Asean region and Singapore's heavy reliance on external trade, any external shock would quickly impact its economy. “Currently, regional growth is resulting in higher-income jobs, increased disposable income, and greater demand for services. This growth fosters intra-regional trade and spillover effects,” he said. “To Singapore, it is especially important. We want everyone to do well, so they can spend a few hundred dollars here to go to the Taylor Swift concert, for example.” With all that has been said and done about Malaysia’s brain drain, the question remains: What will it take for the Malaysian diaspora to feel incentivised to return home and contribute to their country’s economy? Audit associate Phua Jia Herl, 25, who has worked in Singapore for almost two years, said Malaysia must first fix its political issues as political stability would attract more foreign investments. More can also be done to invest in infrastructure. Additionally, Mr Jonathan Lim, a 27-year-old engineer working in Singapore, said there is a need for the authorities to invest not only in infrastructure but also in public services and amenities to improve the overall quality of life in Malaysia. Mr Fahad Naeem, country director at recruitment agency Randstad Malaysia, said that when it comes to talent attraction and retention, government initiatives and employer efforts must go hand-in-hand. He said this is especially important after Covid-19, with governments around the world introducing new talent attraction schemes to draw top global talent to work in their countries. “These initiatives help enhance the overall strength of their local workforce and fill the talent pool gap. However, these initiatives must be complemented with attractive career opportunities that companies in Malaysia can offer. “Besides matching salary expectations, many talents are looking for employers that can offer positive employee experiences.” Conversely, Dr Lee Hwok Aun, senior fellow and co-coordinator of the Malaysia Studies Programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said reducing the pay gap is paramount. “Malaysians residing in Singapore and working in semi-skilled and low-skilled jobs can be attracted to return to Malaysia, but it will be a challenge and requires further study. “But I would hypothesise that the job offerings may not be very different across the countries — noting the main semi-skilled occupations in the study are clerical service work, machine operators, and service and sales workers — and hence earnings differential is the main factor,” he said.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Redhill resident John Posko Amalaraj would sometimes return home to an eyesore — discarded leftover drink cartons in the lifts at his Housing Development Board (HDB) block. A sign cautioning against littering displayed outside People’s Park Complex, on Mar 6, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Redhill resident John Posko Amalaraj would sometimes return home to an eyesore — discarded leftover drink cartons in the lifts at his Housing Development Board (HDB) block. Outside of the lifts, the 67-year-old also worries that stagnant water left to collect in strewn litter in the open could lead to mosquitos breeding, and contribute to a rise in dengue cases. “Compared to last time, the littering is too much — particularly inside the lift,” said the senior customer service captain at the Downtown Line, adding that he had raised his concerns with his Member of Parliament (MP). Even though notices were quickly put up at lift lobbies to remind residents not to litter, the problem persists, said Mr Amalaraj. Similarly, a housewife in the nearby Lengkok Bahru neighbourhood who wanted to be known only as Madam Ng, said that while she does not think that the litter situation is worsening, she has noticed an increase in the number of rodents in the area. The 58-year-old said: “I’ve seen many rats around recently. Last time, it was not so bad. In fact, I didn’t really see (rats) until maybe the last year or so.” Over at Jalan Besar, Ms Wendy Chan, a resident at a condominium along Somme Road, told TODAY that she often sees cigarette butts being littered at the property’s front gate and in its flower pots. “(Some passers-by) love to think that plant pots are little dustbins for them.” As her condominium is next to a public park, birds frequent the area and may sometimes leave droppings on cars that are parked along the main road in front of the property, said the swimming coach in her 50s. Some car owners would clean these droppings on their vehicles with tissues, before dumping the used tissues on the road outside the condominium, she added. Such antisocial acts continue despite the Government’s perennial anti-littering campaign. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) Baey Yam Keng said in Parliament on Monday (March 4) that the authorities had seen an increase of 15 per cent in feedback on ground littering from 2022 to 2023, compared to the two years before the Covid-19 pandemic. Last October, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in its annual report that the number of people caught littering rose between 2021 and 2022 . In 2022, the authorities issued more than 20,000 tickets for littering, a 42 per cent increase from the roughly 14,000 tickets issued in 2021. Responding to TODAY’s queries, NEA disclosed that it issued 18,600 tickets for ground littering in 2023. Currently, those who litter may face a composition fine of S$300 for a first offence , while offenders convicted in court may be issued a fine and sentenced to perform a Corrective Work Order (CWO). CWO — introduced in 1992 — requires recalcitrant offenders to clean public areas for a minimum of three hours, up to a maximum of 12 hours. The regime serves to remind them of the impact of littering and the difficulties faced by cleaners, said NEA. In 2019, NEA also revamped the design of its CWO vest to a luminous pink and yellow in a bid to “raise the visibility of the CWO” and increase its deterrence effect. It also introduced CWO sessions in city areas such as Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar in November 2022 to, as NEA put it, increase the public visibility of such sessions, and “further drive home the impact of littering”. Still, complaints about littering have continued to rise despite these penalties and the authorities’ enhanced enforcement efforts over the years. Mr Baey told Parliament that MSE would thus adopt a “more targeted approach” to tackling littering hot spots. The ministry will conduct around five times as many enforcement blitzes in 2024 compared to 2023, from 21 last year to more than 100 this year. Recalcitrant littering offenders would carry out CWO in areas with high footfall, such as transport nodes and town centres — like Causeway Point in Woodlands — as well as at city locations such as the Somerset area, he added. NEA would also quadruple its deployment of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at littering hot spots, which include HDB estates, to around 1,000. The agency would work with community stakeholders to identify these offenders. In the event that there are still no leads, NEA would explore putting up images of these offenders at the places where they had littered, to seek the wider community’s assistance in identifying them, said Mr Baey. Although the need to keep the island clean has been drummed into generations of Singaporeans since their schooldays, the state of cleanliness and hygiene in several housing estates remains very much a work in progress, MPs told TODAY. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, MP for Bukit Panjang Single Member Constituency, said he receives feedback from residents on littering and sanitation concerns “quite often”. He noted that the situation “has remained the same” over the years, and it is “not a state that we desire”. Ms Joan Pereira, MP for Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency (GRC), said that the town council received about 340 cases of feedback on littering and refuse last year for the Henderson-Dawson ward she oversees. It has received 65 such feedback so far this year, she said. The residents’ concerns are often about ground littering and littering within lift cars — and they typically either request for cleaners to clean the place or to provide information about alleged perpetrators. While there has been a “slight improvement” over the past year, Ms Pereira said there are “definitely areas that can be improved on further”. “While we have targeted measures for places with higher incidence of littering offences, it is not possible just to rely on ramping up the cleaning frequencies. “We really need every resident to play their part and not litter.” Ms Gheetha Mahalangam, whose son and family live at the Skyville @ Dawson HDB cluster in Queenstown, often visits the sky gardens in the block of flats with her granddaughter when she pays them a visit. While they enjoy playing and exercising together amid the greenery, the 64-year-old retiree noted that the littering problem at the sky gardens can be “horrible”. Visitors would often leave behind biscuit packets, chip packets, used masks, and even leftover food. “After eating, even though there is a bin, they just throw it here,” she said, adding that the litter problem is not for lack of waste disposal infrastructure as the bins at the sky garden are usually not full. Ms Chan, the Jalan Besar resident, agreed: “It’s not so much that the bins are overflowing. Actually there are bins at the park… At the most, it’s a 30-second walk. It’s (almost) like people, when they want to throw litter, they want the dustbin right next to them.” Experts interviewed by TODAY cited the lack of a sense of ownership, and hence shared responsibility over caring for a public space, as one reason littering is on the rise in Singapore despite years of enhanced enforcement measures. “I think there’s a sense (among people) that any space outside of the home is not mine to care about and therefore not my responsibility to manage,” said Dr Serene Koh, director of consultancy firm Behavioural Insights Team Singapore. Agreeing, Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that when it comes to anti-littering measures, the “best outcome is to have people who would feel a sense of ownership of public spaces and possess a strong motivation to keep them clean”. This would help residents internalise the positive messaging to love their environment — which includes maintaining the cleanliness of public spaces — rather than focusing on “not messing up” the environment or refraining from littering simply due to fears of punitive measures, he added. Assoc Prof Tan also suggested that the increase in littering offences could be a post-Covid-19 effect, corresponding to the general rise in human traffic. Many Singaporeans also think it is the cleaners’ job to keep the city litter-free. A 2020 survey by the Singapore Management University on public satisfaction with the country’s cleanliness found that over 90 per cent of respondents believed the authorities should demand higher standards of cleaning contractors to make sure bins were cleared promptly. More than eight in 10 (86 per cent) also said they expected cleaners to clear the trash throughout the day to prevent the bins from overflowing, the same study found. Acknowledging this, Mr Baey said in his presentation of his ministry’s budget: “Based on our cleanliness surveys, many still believe that the responsibility to keep Singapore clean lies with the Government and our ‘army of cleaners’. “Our cleaners are already busy cleaning up natural litter such as fallen leaves and accidental litter such as the spillages. Let us not add to their heavy workload with intentional litter by leaving or throwing our litter for them to clean up after us.” Estate cleaners told TODAY that they sweep the litter in their estates throughout their shifts, which run from 7am to 4pm or 5pm, and also clear the bins twice a day. An estate cleaner, who declined to be named, said he understands if residents throw their trash outside of the bins if they were full. However, there are also instances where residents litter beside or near the bins, even when the trash cans are not full. Another cleaner, Mr Abdul Rahim — who oversees three HDB blocks near Haig Road Market and Food Centre, including its nearby playground and garden — said: “Sometimes you finish (cleaning in the morning) already, after that you come around 12 something or 1 something (in the afternoon), and they throw the wrappers (on the ground) again.” The 65-year-old said some items commonly littered include leftover food, wrappers, or paper. Singapore has always made being a clean and green nation a key priority, starting f rom its early days under then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. Most recently, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu announced on Monday (March 4) that the authorities would designate 2024 as the “Year of Public Hygiene”, with targeted measures to further enhance the city-state’s cleanliness. Here’s a look at some milestones in Singapore’s journey to elevate its standards of public hygiene over the years: 1. Oct 1, 1968: Keep Singapore Clean campaign The Keep Singapore Clean campaign — launched on Oct 1, 1968 — was one of Singapore’s first national campaigns as an independent nation. The month-long campaign aimed to make Singapore the cleanest and greenest city in the region, by addressing the problem of inconsiderate littering, said the National Library Board (NLB) in its online archives. 2. 1960s-1980s: Relocation of itinerant hawkers to hawker centres In the 1960s, the authorities carried out an island-wide hawkers’ registration exercise to legalise hawkers — given the thriving trade of unlicensed street hawkers who could set up shop anywhere, which posed potential public hygiene threats. Between 1971 and 1986, the Government embarked on a programme to construct markets and hawker centres with proper amenities, and relocated the street hawkers to these locations. 3. 1977-1987: Clean up of Singapore River and Kallang Basin Besides the physical cleaning of the heavily polluted rivers, the clean-up exercise also involved: 4. Nov 1, 1992: Corrective Work Order The Corrective Work Order (CWO) came into effect on Nov 1, 1992. A punitive measure that requires the offender to clean up the community instead of paying a fine, the first CWOs were performed on Feb 21, 1993 at public places such as parks and beaches. On July 18, 1993, the CWO was conducted at public housing estates for the first time to “bring the lesson closer to home”, said NLB in its online archives. 5. April 1, 2012: Department of Public Cleanliness formed The department, under the National Environment Agency, was formed in April 2012 to improve efficiency and achieve a higher standard of public cleanliness in Singapore. It was later renamed the Division of Public Cleanliness with effect from Sept 1, 2020. 6. 2019: Sustainable Bright Spot campaign launched In 2019, the Public Hygiene Council launched the Sustainable Bright Spot programme to encourage residents to organise regular clean-up activities in their common living spaces. Since then, more than 30 residential estates around Singapore have become Sustainable Bright Spots. As litterbugs continue to be a social menace, many MPs, such as Bukit Panjang’s Mr Liang, have called for stronger measures to deal with the offenders. On what are the biggest challenge he faces in overcoming littering offences in his constituency, Mr Liang told TODAY: “The deterrence effect remains low, and the current surveillance and enforcement regime has still not yielded enough results. “The key to reducing littering is effective enforcement and strong investigative capabilities, as litterbugs must feel that they have a high chance of being caught and punished,” he added. Indeed, cleaners, experts and other MPs whom TODAY interviewed said that turning to surveillance and closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras could be effective, to some extent, in deterring litterbugs. MP for West Coast GRC Ang Wei Neng recounted to TODAY that when he moved to oversee the Nanyang division of his constituency in 2021, he received a lot of feedback from residents about people drinking alcohol, smoking, and littering at the void decks and roof gardens of HDB flats in the area. To tackle the issue, Mr Ang worked with the town council to install mobile CCTV cameras at these hot spots. “The CCTV images helped us to better coordinate with police and NEA to take enforcement actions,” said Mr Ang, adding that the number of similar feedback received has since “reduced significantly”. “Once in a while, we still receive similar feedback at other HDB void decks without mobile CCTV (cameras). We then install the mobile CCTVs at these new locations to deter littering.” Mr Rahim, the estate cleaner, also said he noticed that the littering situation improved after NEA officers started ramping up enforcement and issuing more “saman” (Malay for “fines”) to offenders. Dr Everold Hosein, a senior communication advisor-consultant for the World Health Organization and Unicef, who previously contributed to a 2011 sociological study on littering in Singapore, noted that the study found that the mere “appearance of enforcement” decreased littering. “By that we mean having public health inspectors in a bright uniform just walking around littering hot spots seems to deter littering. They don’t have to issue any tickets… they just have to walk around!” Dr Koh of Behavioural Insights Team added that research on enforcement and compliance has shown that the certainty of getting caught is a more effective deterrent than the severity of the punishment. “If I know I can get away with it, I will take my chances even if the fine is high,” she said of people's mindset. However, there is also a limit to how effective surveillance cameras can be. Ms Pereira, the Tanjong Pagar GRC MP, said: “It is also not easy to identify offenders because they are aware of camera spots and it is not possible to cover every single spot with cameras.” Mr Ang of West Coast GRC also said that challenges arise when his team is unable to identify the culprits, even with the CCTV images on hand. Hence, the MSE’s suggestion that it may explore publicising offenders’ images — only when the authorities are unable to identify the culprits — is a good one, said Mr Ang. “By sharing such images, we could deter other people from littering, and get the community to identify the culprit to facilitate enforcement.” Still, even those who support the move recognise that the line between official surveillance and citizen vigilantism is a fine one to tread — making it necessary for safeguards to be put in place. Mr Ang stressed that the town council will only share the images of CCTV recordings with government agencies, and never with the public. In his ward, the team also removed the mobile CCTV cameras from locations where the occurrence of littering had dropped. Ms Pereira said that as it stands, some residents are already submitting to her and the authorities photos of neighbours or people in the community whom they have seen littering. Asked if she is concerned that publicising offenders’ images might eventually lead Singaporeans down the slippery slope of “endorsing” vigilante behaviour, Ms Pereira added: “That is certainly one of the potential issues, but that is also why a robust investigation is still required to establish the facts and culpability of any alleged culprits.” Agreeing, 29-year-old consultant Darren Then said that while such a measure could be “quite useful”, ensuring that the facts are well-established before putting up such images would be crucial. “We don’t want any instances of accidental littering that is not on purpose (to be published) — and then they (offenders) become public enemy number one,” said Mr Then. Still, some residents expressed confidence that the relevant authorities will conduct due diligence before making public the images of alleged offenders. Ms Chan, the Jalan Besar resident, said: “The authorities are the ones that are going to put the images up, so I think the authorities would view the CCTV first… and identify whether it is really a case of littering or just an accident.” The element of shame inherent in some punitive measures — such as the CWO with its prominent vests and high visibility in locations with high footfall, and MSE’s possible publicising of offenders’ images — can be a strong disincentive for prospective offenders, said those interviewed. Ms Pereira said: “I think such a measure should be effective in targeting certain groups of offenders as a deterrent, given the potential embarrassment from being ‘publicly shamed’ for doing something so unsavoury and inconsiderate, as well as a higher chance of being prosecuted.” Assoc Prof Tan from NUS added that for “people who care about their public image, (a shame-based punitive measure) can be an effective deterrence”. Those who were previously issued CWOs told TODAY that the shame one may feel while serving their penalty could deter them from re-offending, though its effectiveness differs from individual to individual. Mr Ryan Tan still remembers his CWO stint though it happened almost five years ago. The 36-year-old founder of content studio Overkill said that he was caught littering his cigarette butt outside a hotel while on location for a shoot. Mr Tan served about three hours for his CWO session outside Jurong Regional Library. “It was an effective punishment for sure,” said Mr Tan, adding that he also quit smoking altogether. “I’m very much cautious (now). I (would) rather just throw the rubbish in my pockets if I can’t find a dustbin.” The additional exposure — given that he is a semi-public figure — made the penalty “doubly more effective”, said the YouTube personality who had co-founded the now-defunct local production company Night Owl Cinematics, which produced video series such as the popular Food King vlogs. Another person who was issued a CWO about a decade ago for throwing her cigarette butts near a bush said age could be a factor in whether one feels embarrassed by it. “If you ask me, a 30-year-old working professional to do that, I’d be very ashamed. But a lot of offenders are youths in their early 20s or even in their late teens and… I don’t think they're so deterred by the shame of having to serve CWO. Most of them probably think it’s funny — at least that’s what I thought,” said the 31-year-old, who works in commodities. Still, loss of face aside, experts noted that the CWO may also be effective for other reasons, such as the time, effort, and trouble the session involved. Dr Koh said: “Offenders might be wearing the coloured vests but unless people recognise them personally and know who they are, or there are legions of bystanders staring at them and judging them, I don’t actually think the shame dimension is very high. “Honestly, I think it’s the effort and trouble it represents. Offenders have to take time out of their day to serve CWO and it’s troublesome. I suspect people who are deterred by CWO want to avoid the effort, rather than avoid the shame.” Agreeing, the 31-year-old who had previously served a CWO said the order did deter her from further littering as she did not want to go through the hassle of serving it again. Regardless, experts cautioned against using shame-based punitive measures indiscriminately, given their potential pitfalls. For one thing, shame — when harnessed to its extreme — can lead to a loss of self-esteem and reputation, cause undue distress in some, and may even lead individuals to withdraw from the community. “If the misbehaviour warrants these consequences, then shame-based punishments may have a role to play in our justice system. But it needs to be wielded thoughtfully and delicately,” said Dr Koh. “If it’s persistent and deliberate high-rise littering, then I think there is room for some element of shame-based punishment. But if someone is caught unconsciously dropping a plastic bag at the park, shaming them feels disproportionate to the (mis)behaviour. “ Using shame is a delicate thing and the authorities should not be indiscriminate about it. Not all littering behaviours are the same.” Mr Damien Huang, a public policy consultant and associate faculty at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), said that always taking the “ stick” approach can also be a cause of why scams impersonating officials could be more prevalent in Singapore than in other countries. Should the new measure be implemented, he added, “could we see a new scam of ‘Dear XX, you were caught on CCTV dropping a piece of tissue in your neighbourhood. Please pay a fine of S$500 to prevent your photo from being pasted at your lift lobby.’?” On Monday, Mr Baey said that NEA would work closely with the community to identify littering offenders, and would “explore” putting up their images only if there are still no leads. Should the plan to publicise offenders’ images be implemented, experts called on the authorities to proceed with great care and consideration. Dr Koh said: “If it feels like the Government is identifying these offenders for minor littering offences, there will be pushback from the public that the Government is making a mountain out of a molehill, or people’s reputations are unnecessarily harmed for a seemingly ‘small’ offence.” To avoid this, she suggested applying a set of transparent and strict criteria before resorting to publicly identifying the offenders, so that Singaporeans understand that it is not a decision that is taken lightly. “This might (also) go some way towards discouraging (vigilantism)… because people will know that they can’t just name-and-shame anyone. Just as the Government chooses carefully who to identify, this will role-model to them that they must also first establish facts before calling people out.” She added that the criteria can be based on the severity of the action — such as in the case of high-rise littering, or the frequent disposal of trash in an inappropriate manner that thus attracts rats — or the persistence of the offence, such as litterbugs who remain recalcitrant despite multiple engagements by the authorities. Unlike Dr Koh, Mr Huang of SUSS suggested possibly keeping the criteria undisclosed to prevent the public from possibly trying to “game” it. To prevent the “victimisation and scapegoating” of vulnerable groups, such as children and seniors who “may not even realise they are committing an offence”, Mr Huang said the Government should also consider aspects of equitability if and when enforcing the measure. “For children and those who are underaged by law, they should treated more leniently. We may underestimate the psychological and psycho-social effects this may have on their mental-wellbeing as non-matured individuals,” he added. NEA has said that “care will be exercised” in cases committed by young children, the elderly or vulnerable groups. Ultimately, experts told TODAY that a punitive approach, while necessary and effective, must also be accompanied by preventive measures and persistent public education. To achieve behavioural results, Dr Hosein said that there must be a mix of preventive and punitive measures, with a “heavy dose of continued, persistent public education and persuasive communication”. “If what has been done so far only focused primarily on punitive measures, then that is probably not productive. Ongoing public persuasion is needed,” he added. “If we wish to inculcate an anti-littering sensibility in the culture, we need to begin in preschool, from age two onwards.” Experts and residents also suggested that instead of relying on the wider community’s assistance to identify offenders, it could be worthwhile to urge a “different kind of community involvement” — where people actively remind others who may have unintentionally littered, instead of being preoccupied with snapping a picture the moment bad behaviour is detected. Mr Terrence He, a 39-year-old human resource professional who lives in Marine Parade, said: “Everybody should be a vigilante in the sense of ‘eh, you didn’t pick this up’ rather than you take (a photo) from 10m away… and send in to the authorities.” Agreeing, Dr Hosein said: “I would urge an ongoing — not sporadic — campaign of each of us helping each other do the right thing... A gentle reminder from another might be nice, to get me to pick (accidental litter) up and properly dispose of it. “I don’t think we have to go to the extent of public name-and shame. This would increase resentment rather than foster the community sense of citizens helping each other out to be better citizens. Joo Chiat resident Rashid Khalifa said that publicising litterbugs’ photos may be effective against repeated offenders, but he does not think it will make a society a kinder place in the long run.” Wondering aloud whether punishment is the only way to deter people and get them to behave better, the 43-year-old business owner added: “I don’t want to live in a society where I think people are always trying to look out for others’ faults.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Redhill resident John Posko Amalaraj would sometimes return home to an eyesore — discarded leftover drink cartons in the lifts at his Housing Development Board (HDB) block. Faced with the rise in littering cases, the National Environment Agency would quadruple its deployment of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at littering hot spots, which include HDB estates, to around 1,000. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at a proposed move by the authorities to publicise litterbugs’ images, and its effectiveness in tackling a worsening littering situation here. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Redhill resident John Posko Amalaraj would sometimes return home to an eyesore — discarded leftover drink cartons in the lifts at his Housing Development Board (HDB) block. Outside of the lifts, the 67-year-old also worries that stagnant water left to collect in strewn litter in the open could lead to mosquitos breeding, and contribute to a rise in dengue cases. “Compared to last time, the littering is too much — particularly when you see inside the lift,” said the senior customer service captain at the Downtown Line, adding that he had raised his concerns with his Member of Parliament (MP). Even though notices were quickly put up at lift lobbies to remind residents not to litter, the problem persists, said Mr Amalaraj. Over at Jalan Besar, Ms Wendy Chan, a resident at a condominium along Somme Road, told TODAY that she often sees cigarette butts being littered at the property’s front gate and in its flower pots. “(Some passers-by) love to think that plant pots are little dustbins for them.” As her condominium is next to a public park, birds frequent the area and may sometimes leave droppings on cars that are parked along the main road in front of the property, said the swimming coach in her 50s. Some car owners would clean these droppings on their vehicles with tissues, before dumping the used tissues on the road outside the condominium, she added. Estate cleaner Abdul Rahim — who oversees three HDB blocks near Haig Road Market and Food Centre, including its nearby playground and garden — said: “Sometimes you finish (cleaning in the morning) already, after that you come around 12 something or 1 something (in the afternoon), and they throw the wrappers (on the ground) again.” The 65-year-old said some commonly littered items include leftover food, wrappers, or paper. Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) Baey Yam Keng said in Parliament on Monday (March 4) that the authorities had seen an increase of 15 per cent in the number of feedback on ground littering from 2022 to 2023, compared to the two years before the Covid-19 pandemic. Last October, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in its annual report that the number of people caught littering rose between 2021 and 2022 . In 2022, the authorities issued more than 20,000 tickets for littering, a 42 per cent increase from the roughly 14,000 tickets issued in 2021. Responding to TODAY’s queries, NEA disclosed that it issued 18,600 tickets for ground littering in 2023. Currently, those who litter may face a composition fine of S$300 for a first offence , while offenders convicted in court may be issued a fine and sentenced to perform a Corrective Work Order (CWO) . Experts interviewed by TODAY cited the lack of a sense of ownership, and hence shared responsibility over caring for a public space, as one reason littering is on the rise in Singapore despite years of enhanced enforcement measures. A 2020 survey by the Singapore Management University on public satisfaction with the country’s cleanliness also found that many Singaporeans think it is the cleaners’ job to keep the city litter-free . Faced with the rise in littering cases, Mr Baey told Parliament that MSE would thus adopt a “more targeted approach” to tackling littering hot spots. The ministry will conduct around five times as many enforcement blitzes in 2024 compared to 2023, from 21 last year to more than 100 this year. NEA would also quadruple its deployment of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTVs) at littering hot spots, which include HDB estates, to around 1,000. The statutory board under MSE would work with community stakeholders to identify these offenders. In the event that there are still no leads, NEA would explore putting up images of these offenders at the places where they had littered, to seek the wider community’s assistance in identifying them, said Mr Baey. Cleaners, experts and MPs whom TODAY interviewed said that turning to surveillance and closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras could be effective, to some extent, in deterring litterbugs. Mr Rahim, the estate cleaner, said he noticed the littering situation improved after NEA officers started ramping up enforcement and issuing more “saman” (Malay for “fines”) to offenders. Dr Everold Hosein, a senior communication advisor-consultant for the World Health Organization and Unicef, who previously contributed to a 2011 sociological study on littering in Singapore, said the study found that the mere “appearance of enforcement” decreased littering. “By that we mean having public health inspectors in a bright uniform just walking around littering hot spots seem to deter littering. They don’t have to issue any tickets… they just have to walk around!” Dr Serene Koh, director of consultancy firm Behavioural Insights Team Singapore, added that research on enforcement and compliance has shown that the certainty of getting caught is a more effective deterrent than the severity of the punishment. “If I know I can get away with it, I will take my chances even if the fine is high,” she said of people's mindset. However, there is also a limit to how effective surveillance cameras can be. Ms Joan Pereira, an MP for Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency, said: “It is also not easy to identify offenders because they are aware of camera spots and it is not possible to cover every single spot with cameras.” And even those who support the move recognise that the line between official surveillance and citizen vigilantism is a fine one to tread — making it necessary for safeguards to be put in place. Ms Pereira said that as it stands, some residents are already submitting photos — of neighbours or people in the community whom they have seen littering — to the authorities. Asked if she is concerned that publicising offenders’ images might eventually lead Singaporeans down the slippery slope of “endorsing” vigilante behaviour, Ms Pereira added: “That is certainly one of the potential issues, but that is also why a robust investigation is still required to establish the facts and culpability of any alleged culprits.” Agreeing, 29-year-old consultant Darren Then said that while publicising a litterbugs' photos could be “quite useful”, ensuring that the facts are well-established before putting up such images would be crucial. “We don’t want any instances of accidental littering that is not on purpose (to be published) — and then they (offenders) become public enemy number one,” said Mr Then. Should the plan to publicise offenders’ images be implemented, experts called on the authorities to proceed with care and consideration. Dr Koh said: “If it feels like the Government is identifying these offenders for minor littering offences, there will be pushback from the public that the Government is making a mountain out of a molehill, or people’s reputations are unnecessarily harmed for a seemingly ‘small’ offence.” To avoid this, she suggested applying a set of transparent and strict criteria before resorting to publicly identifying the offenders, so that Singaporeans understand that it is not a decision that is taken lightly. “This might (also) go some way towards discouraging (vigilantism)… because people will know that they can’t just name-and-shame anyone. Just as the Government chooses carefully who to identify, this will role-model to them that they must also first establish facts before calling people out.” She added that the criteria can be based on the severity of the action — such as in the case of high-rise littering, or the frequent disposal of trash in an inappropriate manner that thus attracts rats — or the persistence of the offence, such as litterbugs who remain recalcitrant despite multiple engagements by the authorities. Unlike Dr Koh, Mr Damien Huang, a public policy consultant and associate faculty at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, suggested possibly keeping the criteria undisclosed to prevent the public from possibly trying to “game” it. To prevent the “victimisation and scapegoating” of vulnerable groups, such as children and seniors who “may not even realise they are committing an offence”, Mr Huang said the Government should also consider aspects of equitability if and when enforcing the measure. “For children and those who are underaged by law, they should treated more leniently,” he added. NEA has said that “care will be exercised” in cases committed by young children, the elderly or vulnerable groups. Ultimately, experts told TODAY that a punitive approach, while necessary and effective, must also be accompanied by preventive measures and persistent public education. They also suggested that instead of relying on the wider community’s assistance to identify offenders, it could be worthwhile to urge a “different kind of community involvement” — where people actively remind others who may have unintentionally littered, instead of being preoccupied with snapping a picture the moment bad behaviour is detected. Dr Hosein said: “I would urge an ongoing — not sporadic — campaign of each of us helping each other do the right thing...

    "article_content": "Big Read Parents of infants have highlighted that finding sufficient childcare support is a major challenge in Singapore, as infant care centres have few vacancies and some are too costly. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When her six-month-old baby contracted hand, foot and mouth disease, Ms Joanne Chong turned to Facebook to look for a babysitter who could look after the baby in her own home. But even though she was prepared to pay the quoted rates, ranging from S$23 to S$40 per hour, many of the babysitters she contacted rejected her after learning her child was sick. The 32-year-old finally found one who was available and willing, and this “truly took a load off” the couple, she said, especially as her husband also fell ill that week. If it is tough to find an ad hoc nanny, it can be just as challenging to find a spot in an infant care centre, several parents told TODAY. Ms Belinda Koh, 28, registered her interest online for various centres in her hunt for a vacancy. Finally, one called her back, but insisted that she confirm her daughter's enrolment within the same day when they had a sudden vacancy, although she had not even visited the centre before. She managed to visit the centre within the day to have a look around and ask some questions, before calling back to secure her daughter's slot a few hours later. She had to go through this ordeal even though she had registered her interest for an infant care spot on the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) website around three months before her daughter was born. \"We only received calls from the private centres, whose fees were over S$2,000 monthly before subsidies,\" said Ms Koh. Another mom found that looking for an infant care centre for her two-month-old son was an exercise in balancing various priorities. “My biggest issue was finding a centre close to my house, but even the closest ones were a little out of the way,\" said Ms Salmah Alsagoff, 34, a lead account manager in the oil and gas industry. \"Because of this I had to look at locations nearer to my office in the Central Business District, which can be very pricey.\" Many of the centres that she liked were out of her price range at around S$2,000 a month, even after working-mother subsidies. Eventually, she decided to enrol her son at a centre that had one last vacancy, even though she was on a waitlist at another centre that she was keen on. \"I think it's crazy how you have to start looking for centres before your child is born to secure a slot. I apparently started very late by looking in my last trimester,\" she said. Such stories of parents having to undergo frantic hunts for infant or childcare services and finding themselves put on long waitlists, having to pay more than they were prepared to or taking up a less-than-ideal option are rather common in Singapore. In fact, in the 16-month-long Forward Singapore feedback exercise , many parents highlighted the lack of childcare support in Singapore as a major concern. Many also said the first 18 months of their children's lives were the hardest for them, as they struggled to adapt to juggling work and the needs of an infant. In an effort to plug the gaps in Singapore's childcare landscape, the Ministry of Social and Family Development said it is launching a pilot in the second half of this year, which will introduce a new childminding service for parents with infants aged two months to 18 months old. The three-year pilot will serve children aged two months to 18 months and aims to cater to 500 infants in its first year. Appointed childminding operators under the pilot will receive funding from ECDA to keep their fees similar to what median income families pay for infant care at anchor operators, around S$700 a month. The Government will also allow parents to tap the Child Development Account — a special savings account for children that can be used to pay for pre-school and healthcare fees — to further defray the cost of such services. Under the pilot, the service will be available only during weekdays and working hours. In response to TODAY's queries, an MSF spokesperson said that catering to parents outside typical working hours would involve \"additional challenges\" such as ensuring that there are childminders available to provide services for extended hours, at night and on weekends. “After the pilot stabilises, MSF will assess demand and look into the feasibility of catering to parents with varying care needs,\" the spokesperson said. MSF added that it is looking into requiring childminding operators on the pilot to offer services in either half-day or full-day blocks and introducing a minimum number of stipulated hours that parents must use the childminding services per month. This approach is meant to provide childminders and parents with “greater certainty and reliability” in terms of service provision, and parents will still have some flexibility in terms of the total number of days they use per month, said MSF. Single mother Ria, 19, had to withdraw her now 16-month-old son from infant care as the location was too far from her workplace. Through her family service centre, Ms Ria, a medic with a private ambulance company, was referred to Daughters of Tomorrow (DOT) , a local charity focused on supporting underprivileged women in being financially independent. DOT offers childminding services to lower-income families at affordable rates and assigned Ms Ria a childminder at a rate of $5 an hour. Ms Ria has become a big fan of the service: Childminding gives Ms Ria the flexibility of picking up her son even when she ends work slightly late, as compared with infant care centres that have strict pick-up times and typically charge parents late fees. But while non-governmental organisations such as DOT offer cheap childminding services, these are only for lower-income families. Professional childminding operators told TODAY that for others, engaging a nanny or babysitter on a regular basis can cost up to S$3,500 a month. In response to TODAY’s queries, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said monthly fees for childminding services range from around S$1,200 to S$2,800. Ms Apple Tan, 32, said she would appreciate the individualised attention that her son could get with a nanny, but engaging a childminder is too costly in the current market. “Nanny care at S$3,000 a month is too expensive for a middle-income family like mine. If parents engage ad hoc nanny services, it can cost up to S$25 an hour, so for a full day it would easily be S$300, if you hire the nanny from 7am to 7pm,” said the IT business analyst. Furthermore, existing childminding services are unregulated. Dr Mu Zheng, an assistant professor at the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at the National University of Singapore (NUS), said this is one reason why most parents here either depend on family members, engage the help of domestic workers or enrol their kids in infant and childcare centres instead. “Singaporean parents may trust childcare more to family; when familial support is not well available, they refer to more mature and well-professionalised arrangements such as childcare centres,\" she said. “It will take more infrastructural and administrative development for childminding to be well-trusted and used by Singaporean parents,” added Dr Mu. Checks by TODAY found that current screening practices for childminders vary across companies. A Babysits spokesperson said that the platform does not perform automatic checks on its community members and members are responsible for running background checks on whoever they choose to work with. While there are some safeguards in place, such as babysitters having to confirm their profile using a government identity verification process before being able to send messages to parents, Babysits said it cannot address problems arising with member interactions outside of its platform. On the Aunty app, all sitters undergo a screening process through which their identity cards are verified. They are then checked for any previous criminal record and have to fill out an application form where they have to detail their childcare experience and certifications. A phone interview is also conducted to assess their personality and communication skills, and Aunty actively monitors reviews of bookings and tracks babysitters’ reliability ratings, and those who fall short will be removed from the app, said the platform founder Ms Amanda Ong. In her speech announcing the MSF childminding pilot, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling noted that childminders — more often known as babysitters or nannies — were more common in Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s. These nannies looked after a few children in their own homes or travelled to a family’s home to care for a child. “They are less common today as parents may be unsure of where to look for trusted childminders or they may find childminding relatively more expensive as compared to other caregiving options, such as infant care centres,” said Ms Sun. Dr Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from NUS, said that the higher educational attainment and labour force participation of women would have also decreased the supply of childminders. Other experts cited the plethora of infant care options available today. “In the 70s and 80s, parents did not have the choice of placing their infants in structured infant-care centres like today,\" noted Dr Cynthia Lim, the head of the Bachelor of Early Childhood Education programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS). Infant care centres were only set up in the last 20 years or so, she pointed out. And such centres have become more popular as they are subsidised, and working mothers get additional childcare subsidies, noted Ms Priscilla Tay, DOT’s programme development and incubator manager. In countries such as Australia and the United States, however, home-based care models are state-supported. National childcare subsidies in these countries extend to home-based services, and childminders have to undergo regular training and safety checks. It is time for Singapore to adopt a similar approach, experts said, as the need and demand for more flexible care arrangements has increased. The option of childminding services would also be a boon to those who might not want to send their babies to an infant care centre, where they are exposed to many other children while their immunity is still weak. Dr Lucy Quek, dean of curriculum and programmes at the National Institute of Early Childhood Development, added that childminders are known to offer extra services, such as sending the children to the doctor for vaccinations or common cold and flu consultations, services which would not be feasible for an infant care centre to provide. Childminders can also provide customised one-on-one care, tapping their specialised experience. Childminders told TODAY that their credentials range from their personal experience as parents, to their background in early childhood education or the healthcare sector. Twenty-year-old Ow Fu Yang, a nursing student who is also a registered babysitter on childminding platform Meide, said offering ad hoc childminding services has provided him with a chance to upskill and learn more about caring for children. Mr Ow, who is waiting to enlist in National Service, worked for a year in a paediatric ward in a public hospital and brings his experience with basic infant care, first aid, food safety and hygiene to his role as a nanny. Madam Cecilia Jacob, 56, who also has a background in early childhood education and joined childminding company NannyPro this year, currently cares for a six-month-old at his parent’s house. She follows a customised curriculum provided by the baby's mother, which involves training the child’s motor skills and visualisation skills, such as with stimulus cards. Some childminding operators directly assign or act as intermediaries to connect caregivers from their pool of staff with parents. Other operators serve as platforms that facilitate direct connections between parents and childminders. Kidibliss provides on-demand care services for children aged two months to 12 years old. Kidibliss will send a staff childminder’s profile to parents and arrange a Zoom session for parents, the childminder and the agency to discuss the child’s needs and requirements. It also offers corporate childminding services. Fees for advance nanny care start at S$800 per month for six-hour blocks per day at a nanny’s home. Another company, NannyPro, assigns trained nannies to provide regular or part-time care at the family’s home. Rates for a regular nanny for 20 weekdays of nine hours a day are between S$2,900 and S$3,500. NannyPro also provides ad-hoc services at a day rate of S$27 per hour during non-peak periods (weekdays before 6pm) and $35 per hour on weekends, for the caregiving of one child. Additional costs apply if there is more than one child to be cared for and on public holidays. There is also a 20 per cent surcharge for urgent requests within 48 hours. Then there is Meide, which matches vetted babysitters on its platform with parents. Users pay a one-time platform fee of S$98 and the babysitters’ salary, which can range from S$8 to S$30 per hour. NannySOS, a professional confinement agency in Singapore, also offers babysitting services, beginning at S$25 per hour for ad hoc requests and at S$800 per month for a regular weekday daytime babysitter at the nanny’s house. While some parents directly contact childminders over social media such as Facebook groups, there are platforms that enable parents and childminders to directly interact. Aunty is a mobile application that allows childminders and parents to register accounts, where parents can contact up to five childminder profiles, who can then respond to requests based on their availability. Of the 13,000 parents registered on its app, more than half have infants below the age of 18 months. The platform has over 600 verified childminders. While rates depend on factors such as duration of care needed and specific requirements from families, they are on average S$20 to S$25 per hour at Aunty, said its founder Amanda Ong. Another platform is Babysits, a Rotterdam-based international babysitting platform where users can sign up either as a babysitter, nanny or childminder or as someone looking for a babysitter. In response to TODAY’s queries, Babysits said that it has more than five million users worldwide. It has 2,236 active babysitters and 987 active families in Singapore since entering the market in 2018. Parents and babysitters can each quote their own rates on their profiles. Parents in Singapore offer an average of S$17.96 per hour, while babysitters ask for around S$17.55 per hour. Parents told TODAY that the safety standards of the MSF pilot is their top concern, not least because of a recent spate of high-profile abuse cases that have occurred at preschools. Ms Deborah Dayani Nanayakara, 39, a mother of two eight-month-old twin boys and a two-year-old daughter, said such cases have made her extra cautious, and the fact that the childminding industry is currently unregulated means that childminding is her \"last option\". Her twins are currently in infant care, while her daughter is in a playgroup. Even though MSF has said that background checks will be conducted on childminders in the pilot, Ms Dayani said that she and her husband would still prefer to approach family first or trusted friends if they ever need additional help outside of a school structure. \"Also, the cost of this service is too expensive, in our opinion. We pay similar costs for the twins to be in infant care but we know that they have activities that the teachers do with them to build their language and motor skills, ensure that they are hitting their developmental progress when they are in school,\" she said. Ms Justine Ong-Farmer, 31, a homemaker and mother of two, is also “very sceptical” as to how the safety of care provided by childminders will be regulated under the pilot, especially in a home setting. Under the pilot, childminding services will take place either at the childminder’s residence or at a “community space” such as a community centre. \"I find it hard to entrust other people to care for my children — especially this young — unless they are family,\" Ms Ong-Farmer said. \"Looking after children, can be so rewarding but the days are also filled with many frustrating and infuriating moments. It makes it a bit easier if they are your flesh and blood.\" Ms Katie Tan, a 35-year-old healthcare staff who engaged a babysitter under Meide, also expressed concern that having infant childminding at a community centre, which is an “open space”, would run the risk of children getting sick often, as they are prone to in group care settings. Many parents and babysitters interviewed also suggested the mandating of closed-circuit television (CCTV) in the childminding settings. These would not only provide parents with peace of mind, but also offer nannies some protection to avoid miscommunication in the case of any incident, they said. Mr Andrew Ng, 29, a creative lead in the parenting sector and parent of two, said that the fact that MSF will allow childminders under the pilot to care for up to three infants at a time is concerning. “Currently, in infant care, if one (carer) is on break, there will be another who can cover her,\" he noted. Agreeing, Ms Uni Tan, a 31-year-old freelance babysitter, said that she mainly provides one-on-one care. “The (proposed ratio) is not very ideal, because in a school there’s more than one teacher but in a house setting there’s only one minder. So what if something happens, like a fire, if a child falls or I need to attend to one child, if I need to cook or prepare food?” Dr Rebecca Chan, a lecturer from NIE’s Psychology and Child and Human Development, agreed that the preferred ratio of caregiver to infant would be 1:1, as a consistent caregiver can devote more attention and build a strong bond with an infant. “Taking care of an infant is rewarding but also a back-breaking, intensive, full-time responsibility that requires dedication, patience and a considerable amount of physical and emotional energy towards feeding, diaper changes and comforting, sensory stimulation, interaction and learning,\" she said. Other regulations that parents said they would like to see implemented in the pilot: MSF has said it will collaborate with appointed childminding operators to ensure “baseline service standards” and establish industry standards for childminding. ECDA will conduct background checks on operators and childminders, including assessing the suitability and homes of childminders, disclosing their profiles to parents and establishing processes for incident management. Childminders will have to undergo required training in areas such as basic infant care, first aid, food safety and hygiene, and ECDA will check if they have any criminal history, such as child-related offences. MSF also said it will also look into extending background checks to those who have regular access to a childminder’s home, such as their family members. Ultimately, establishing a relationship of trust between the caregiver and parents is critical to ensure the pilot takes off, said Dr Lim from SUSS. As handing over one's baby to a stranger is a big and emotional step for parents, Dr Lim said that background checks, proper training and strict safety regulations would go a long way in giving parents enough peace of mind to entrust their babies to a childminder. Even as such details may be ironed out, others pointed out that the pilot cannot fill all the gaps in the childcare landscape. For example, Ms Frances Hong, a 25-year-old recruitment team leader, thinks having more affordable childminding options for ad-hoc arrangements would be appealing, but the MSF pilot, which will only offer childminding within working hours, does not quite meet her needs. “Night-time services after 6pm, when we have an important dinner to attend, is probably when I'd engage these kinds of services,\" she said. Ms Tay from DOT noted that while the pilot programme is a \"good start\", it falls short of fully addressing the demands for flexible care arrangements, especially for lower-income women. \"The current pilot, offered only during working hours, may not sufficiently accommodate mothers who work irregular shifts or require childcare outside of standard childcare operating hours,\" she said, adding that lower-income women tend to be those who work irregular shifts. Agreeing, senior lecturer in Early Childhood Education Melissa Simin Goh-Karssen from SUSS noted that jobs with more non-traditional schedules, such as shift work and home-based businesses, have resulted in parents having more complex and diverse needs that regular standard infant care structures cannot accommodate. It also remains to be seen whether there will be ample supply of childminders under the pilot. Ms Tay noted that there may be potential childminders who might face a barrier to entry into the industry because they lack the financial resources to make their homes suitable enough for childminding services. “Providing necessary items such as cots, changing tables, and play equipment could alleviate this burden, and ensure that childminders have the resources needed to maintain a safe environment for infants under their care.\" Beyond the operational details of the childminding service itself, nannies and experts said they hope MSF will see this pilot as a first step towards regulating and professionalising the whole industry. Ms Pauline Lim, a 50-year-old part-time nanny with NannyPro, hopes that with government regulation and the establishment of industry standards, nannies like herself could earn higher salaries as a result. This would also help to attract talent beyond of the typical demographic of women in their 40s and 50s, she added. SUSS’ Associate Professor Sirene Lim noted that if nannies’ home environments are expected to be “more stimulating” for the infants, then their remuneration should match parents’ expectations. As nanny services are expected to have a lower adult-child ratio, in-home care tends to be more expensive than centre-based care in other developed countries, she noted. Ms Becky Eng, the founder of childminding company NannyPro, noted that there is a stereotype that nannies are \"uneducated aunties\" who have no other job options. This is a mindset that she has been working to change, she said. “It’s a dignified profession. I onboard all our nannies with our suite of training, not just the basic care of the baby where you just change them and feed them. Parents’ expectations have evolved, and they are looking for more high-value services from a nanny.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — When her six-month old baby contracted hand, foot and mouth disease and was given a one-week medical certificate, Ms Joanne Chong turned to Facebook to engage a nanny or babysitter. Parents and experts said more can be done to help parents feel secure in choosing childminding services, and to help childminders professionalise their services. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the range of childminding services for infants in Singapore, and parents and experts' responses to an upcoming launch of a childminding pilot for infants aged two to 18 months’ old. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — When her six-month old baby contracted hand, foot and mouth disease and was given a one-week medical certificate, Ms Joanne Chong turned to Facebook to engage a nanny or babysitter. Even though she was prepared to pay their quoted rates ranging from S$23 to S$40 per hour, many of the babysitters she contacted rejected her after learning her child was sick. “When one babysitter replied that she was free the next few days, we quickly confirmed her,” said the 32-year-old, who works in human resources. If finding an ad hoc babysitter is tough, finding a long-term infant care service can be just as difficult, parents told TODAY. Many infant care centres are short on vacancies, and parents often find themselves on waitlists. Others say that when they do find centres that seem ideal, the fees can be exorbitant. A new pilot to be launched by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) aims to help by offering childminding services at affordable rates for infants aged two months to 18 months. This new service will be introduced in the second half of this year and will start off as a three-year-pilot, with fees similar to what median income families pay for infant care at anchor operators — around S$700 a month. Under this pilot, the service will only be available on weekdays during working hours. In response to TODAY's queries, an MSF spokesperson said that catering to parents outside typical working hours would involve \"additional challenges\" such as ensuring that there are childminders available to provide services for extended hours, at night and on weekends. “After the pilot stabilises, MSF will assess demand and look into the feasibility of catering to parents with varying care needs,\" the spokesperson said. While nannies were common in Singapore in the 1970s and 1980s, they have become much less so today as parents are relying more on their own family members, domestic helpers or infant and childcare centres, which are regulated and offer subsidised fees. Existing childminding services are not subsidised, which means that it is costly to hire childminders on a regular basis. According to MSF, monthly fees for childminding services range from around S$1,200 to S$2,800, while professional childminding operators told TODAY it can cost up to S$3,500 a month. Furthermore, the childminding industry in Singapore is unregulated, which makes parents more wary. Parents, childcare professionals and experts noted that there is a huge demand for more childcare options that are safe, regulated and offered at affordable rates, so MSF's pilot is a welcome move. Parents may need more reassurances that the childminding service being offered under this pilot is good enough — many whom TODAY spoke to had questions about safety standards. MSF has said that it will work with childminding operators to establish industry standards for the sector. In the meantime, parents have some suggestions of rules and checks that they would like to see. Ms Deborah Dayani Nanayakara, a 39-year-old mother of two eight-month-old twin boys and a two-year-old daughter, pointed to the high-profile cases of child abuse that were recently uncovered at a few preschools here. For her, the cases reflect the importance of stringent background checks on and regular check-ins with childcare workers. One solution suggested by both parents and nannies themselves: Closed-circuit television in childminding locations. These, they say, would provide parents with peace of mind and offer nannies some protection to avoid miscommunication in the case of any incident. They had a plethora of other suggestions, including mandatory child-proofing of the childminders' homes and psychological evaluations of childminders. Other parents had concerns about the fact that MSF plans to allow childminders under the pilot to care for up to three infants at one time. Experts, too, noted that caring for even one infant is a tough job that requires total dedication, so it may not be feasible for one childminder to care for more than one baby at a time. Meanwhile, one expert pointed out that the pilot, which is offering the service only on weekdays and during working hours, will not help parents who need help outside of these periods, such as those who do shift work. While the introduction of MSF's pilot will certainly offer parents an added caregiving option, it cannot plug all the existing gaps in the childcare landscape. It also remains to be seen whether the pilot will be fully embraced by parents, as some questions remain. Aside from addressing parents' safety concerns, there is also the question of whether there will be enough supply of childminders to meet demand. Ms Priscilla Tay, the programme development and incubator manager at Daughters of Tomorrow, noted that there may be potential childminders who might face a barrier to entry because they lack the financial resources to make their homes suitable enough for childminding services. There should be help given to such potential nannies, she said. Beyond the operational details of the childminding service itself, nannies and childminding operators said they hope MSF will see this pilot as a first step towards regulating and professionalising the whole industry. For example, authorities should take steps to ensure that nannies are well-compensated and well-equipped to provide quality care, even in their own homes. Ms Becky Eng, founder of childminding service operator NannyPro, noted that there is a stereotype of nannies being \"aunties\" who are uneducated and have no other job options. This is a mindset that she has been working to change, she said. “It’s a dignified profession.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Ever since the stringent no-visitor rule in hospitals was temporarily imposed at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Paul Osmond George, who has ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy, has had a phobia of being hospitalised. Come April 1, a pilot scheme where patients are hospitalised at home will become a “mainstream” service in public hospitals This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Ever since the stringent no-visitor rule in hospitals was temporarily imposed at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Paul Osmond George, who has ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy, has had a phobia of being hospitalised. The 46-year-old’s condition is managed with medication to reduce fluid build-up and dilation of blood vessels to allow his heart to pump blood to the rest of his body. In January, when an upper respiratory tract infection caused a huge fluid build-up in Mr George’s body, leading to coughing and vomiting, his cardiologist at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) advised hospitalisation for a more effective diuretic medication treatment. However, given Mr George’s aversion to hospitals, he immediately took up his doctor’s offer — with “no second thoughts or worries” — to recover at home under the Mobile Inpatient Care-at-Home (MIC@Home) pilot, aimed at making “virtual wards” a viable alternative to traditional hospital care. “(My condition) would have been better dealt with in hospital, especially if something happened, but I prefer home,” said Mr George, who was a general manager at a European multinational firm here before he had to stop working due to his medical condition. Following daily Zoom calls with SKH doctors and visits twice a day from nurses to administer drugs, he was discharged from the programme after six days. “Receiving treatment in the comfort of my home was easier for me and my spouse,” Mr George said, adding that it also helped knowing that he could be admitted to the hospital if necessary. New mum Fatin Farzana Miswan, 31, also decided to make use of the MIC@Home scheme after her baby had jaundice just five days after birth in February. Jaundice — which occurs when a yellow substance called bilirubin builds up in the blood — is common in newborns because their livers are still developing and might not be able to get rid of bilirubin as quickly as needed. Bilirubin is formed when red blood cells break down. As a first-time parent, the geologist was fraught with anxiety, given her baby’s tender age and the arrangements she and her husband would have to make to visit the child in hospital. “I’ll be thinking and worrying about what is happening to my daughter,” said Ms Farzana. “We also don’t have a car, so I think it’d be quite difficult for us to commute back and forth to the hospital.” She was also breastfeeding at the time, which added another layer of stress for her. Newborns need to be fed about eight times a day, and it would not be feasible for Ms Farzana to be at the hospital for every feeding. When she took her daughter to a polyclinic, Ms Farzana was told her baby’s bilirubin levels were within a range where she could undergo phototherapy treatment under the MIC@Home pilot at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. “When the option of having KKH@Home was proposed to us, I thought it would be good for me as a breastfeeding mother,” said Ms Farzana. Babies with jaundice are placed in a cot or incubator fitted with blue light that changes the bilirubin to a form that can easily pass out of the body. Setting up a “virtual ward” in her home was a seamless process. The phototherapy machine was delivered to her flat, before KKH nurses came to advise her on how long to administer phototherapy treatment, and how to take her baby’s vital signs and record them on an app. “It was quite an easy process, especially because the phototherapy machine isn’t very complicated. It’s just switching on and off. There were no fancy buttons or anything,” said Ms Farzana. Being connected to the nurses through a WhatsApp group also eased her worries, especially when she had questions about her daughter’s care. “We were quite assured that our daughter would be okay because we had the medical support we needed , ” she said. While virtual wards may still be a novelty for many Singaporeans, they are not new — similar models have been widely adopted overseas. Virtual wards were first piloted in England in 2005 and have since been further scaled up by the country's National Health Service, with more than 10,000 virtual beds available. It is now looking at expanding it further to reach 40 to 50 virtual ward “beds” per 100,000 people, which would mean more than 50,000 admissions a month. In Australia, the concept has been taken further with the setting up of a standalone virtual hospital in Adelaide. There, nurses and doctors will provide round-the-clock care through videoconferencing technology and wearable devices to monitor patients remotely. In Singapore, the Ministry of Health launched the MIC@Home pilot in April 2022 as part of ongoing efforts to future-proof the healthcare system in a rapidly ageing Singapore. The pilot was an extension of the Covid-19 Virtual Ward programme launched in September 2021 to free up bed capacity in Singapore’s Covid-19 wards for the more seriously ill when Singapore experienced a spike in coronavirus cases. MIC@Home offers eligible patients with certain conditions — such as skin infections, urinary tract infections, and congestive heart failure with fluid overload — the option of being cared for in the comfort of their own homes instead of a hospital ward. Speaking in Parliament on March 6 during a debate on his ministry’s budget, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung announced that from April 1, the MIC@Home service will become “mainstream” and be offered as part of public hospitals’ regular services. Mr Ong said the rationale is so that Singapore is not trapped in the mindset of “building hospitals” when thinking about expanding healthcare capacity. “There is potential to better anchor care outside of hospitals and in the community,” said Mr Ong. Like Mr George and Ms Farzana’s baby, not all patients require “high-acuity care” and constant monitoring in a hospital throughout their treatment course. “Many need convalescent care and rehabilitation, with the assurance that additional medical help is readily available,” added Mr Ong. As of end-2023, more than 2,000 patients had used MIC@Home, which saved about 9,000 hospital bed days. Other hospitals that now offer MIC@Home are Changi General Hospital (CGH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and hospitals under National University Health System (NUHS). Currently, there are 104 MIC@Home virtual beds across all these hospitals. In response to TODAY’s queries, MOH said it aims to provide up to 300 MIC@Home virtual beds this year in light of the move to make it a mainstream service. With virtual wards poised to become a fixture in Singapore’s healthcare landscape, TODAY spoke to hospitals and patients about their experiences with the MIC@Home programme, as well as doctors and experts on what the mainstreaming of the service means for the nation’s healthcare services. Before a patient is selected for MIC@Home, the hospital has to first evaluate them for suitability based on the following criteria and get their consent, various hospitals with the MIC@Home pilot told TODAY: Patients come from three main areas: The emergency department, inpatient wards and specialist outpatient clinics. SGH@Home’s lead, Dr Michelle Tan, said the majority of cases it handles consist of general medical conditions such as exertional rhabdomyolysis (often from spinning exercise), dengue fever, severe infections requiring intravenous antibiotics, and poorly controlled diabetes requiring closer monitoring and management. For KKH, its MIC@Home programme sees children with common conditions such as dengue fever, skin infections, eczema and urinary tract infections, as well as women with stable gynaecological conditions and wounds, said Dr Kelly Low, co-lead for KKH@Home as well as head and consultant, general paediatrics service. While patients are recommended to take up MIC@Home, it is still presented as an option and they can decline it at any time. Clinical Assistant Professor See Qin Yong at CGH noted that “patients are able to make an informed choice on whether to proceed with the home-based care”. “Patients are able to continue their treatment in the hospital if they prefer,” said Asst Prof See, who is also a consultant at CGH's Department of Care and Health Integration. Dr Tan, who is also head and senior consultant of Family Medicine Continuing Care at SGH, said that some patients have declined to be part of MIC@Home as they are more familiar with receiving medical treatment in the hospital. “This will require a mindset change in patients and their caregivers to accept this new model,” Dr Tan said. Other reasons patients do not take up MIC@Home include the lack of caregiving support at home or if their home environment is not suitable for MIC@Home. Patients under MIC@Home are generally loaned monitoring devices, namely blood pressure monitoring sets, thermometers, and pulse oximeters, depending on their medical condition. Healthcare workers can monitor patients via a dashboard that contains all the pertinent information on their conditions. Doctors will review patients daily through video calls and visit them at home based on their clinical needs. Nurses will also visit most patients at least once daily for intravenous infusions or blood tests. If needed, the hospital’s physiotherapists and occupational therapists can see patients at home, and the latter can return to the hospital for scans if these are required. Just like a normal hospital ward, a specialist consultant is in charge of every patient admitted to the programme. The consultants work with a team of junior doctors, nurses, therapists, and administrative staff to ensure each patient gets the care and support they need round the clock. Doctors and nurses on the MIC@Home teams do not have any duties in the ward and are solely focused on teleconsultations and home visits. They communicate with patients and their families using messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and phone calls. The size of the teams and the number of patients they care for vary. NUH’s team, for instance, is 80 strong and consists of doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, and administrative staff. SGH@Home’s team is made up of 10 doctors and nurses. Should the patient’s medical condition suddenly escalate, MIC@Home teams are trained to “recognise these signs early and ensure a seamless transition back to hospital care when necessary”, said Dr Stephanie Ko, a consultant at the division of advanced internal medicine at National University Hospital (NUH) and lead of NUHS@Home. Patients and caregivers are also advised to immediately go to the emergency department should the patient’s medical condition deteriorate. Dr Tan said that to ensure patients adhere to their treatment plans, they and their families are counselled on their roles to support optimal and safe recovery. Patients are also advised to stay at home for the duration of their recovery, as well as the diet and rest required. In some cases, SGH’s dietetics team also conducts reviews for the patient, said Dr Tan. As MIC@Home relies heavily on stable internet, contingency plans are in place in the event of a sudden lost connection, which are also discussed with the family beforehand. “We fall back on good old pen and paper records and phone calls,” said Ms Sally Oh, director of patient support services at KKH. Once the patient has completed treatment and is assessed to have recovered, they will be discharged, and a suitable outpatient follow-up will be arranged. In his parliamentary speech, Mr Ong said MIC@Home is not set to cost more than a regular hospital stay, and might be projected to cost the same or less. “Patients can be assured that they will not pay any more for this service than they do in a public hospital as all our hospitals intend to price MIC@Home similar to or lower than a normal ward,” Mr Ong said. MIC@Home will be supported by subsidies and insurance and savings schemes such as the Integrated Shield Plan , and the Central Provident Fund’s MediShield Life and MediSave , if applicable. With MIC@Home still a work in progress, there has been some debate as to how much it should cost. Some feel that the programme should cost less than a regular hospital stay, given the lack of hospital settings and use of its facilities. However, Assistant Professor Ian Ang, from Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health (SSHSPH) at the National University of Singapore, said: “Even though the patients are not in the physical hospital facilities, the cost is not necessarily cheaper in providing the care — telemonitoring devices are used, and there are still mobile care teams that will travel to the homes of the patients who need certain in-person care treatments.” Adjunct Assistant Professor Melvin Seng, also from SSHSPH, said he will not be surprised if MIC@Home costs more initially, as starting new programmes usually requires higher costs. This is due to the set-up of equipment and processes, as well as the training of healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. “The good news is that, in the long run, there should be cost savings once the programme is well set up, running smoothly and with good uptake,” said Asst Prof Seng, who is also an occupational medicine specialist. While the MIC@Home programme allows patients to recover in the comfort of their homes, the knock-on effect of this arrangement is also keenly felt by their caregivers. Mr Adrian Tiam, a 53-year-old private hire driver, felt reassured having his daughter Charlotte recuperate at home in February after she was diagnosed with dengue fever and required hospitalisation due to a dangerously low platelet count of 50,000 per ml. Platelets help to clot a person’s blood and prevent excessive bleeding. When the platelet count is low, one may have trouble stopping bleeding. Since normal platelet counts are between 150,000 and 450,000 per ml. When Charlotte, 16, and Mr Tiam went to CGH, they had to wait 12 hours before she finally got a bed close to midnight and was warded for one night. “I felt nervous and uneasy in a new environment as I had to sleep in the hospital overnight,” said Charlotte. The student was “quite happy” to be told by the CGH@Home team later that while her platelet count was still low, she would be eligible for the pilot programme to recover from home. Once back home, Charlotte was instructed to take her temperature, blood oxygen level, and blood pressure three times a day: At 9am, 1pm, and 4pm. These vital sign readings will be automatically uploaded to CGH@Home’s command centre, where a medical team monitors patients around the clock. A nurse also went to her house to do a blood test for Charlotte. “I definitely felt well taken care of, as the nurses and doctor would call me if I didn’t take my blood pressure readings at my normal times,” said Charlotte. Mr Tiam said having Charlotte recover at home meant he and his wife could watch over her “24 hours a day”, and did not have to make special arrangements at work to accommodate the hospital’s visiting hours. “You can just be at home, and we can request to work from home to care for her, it (MIC@Home) made it really easy and good for us,” said Mr Tiam. He also noticed that Charlotte’s mood improved when she was at home for three days in the virtual ward. “She appeared to be much more cheery and happier…She also seemed to be less worried about her illness,” said Mr Tiam. The same can be said for 64-year-old Sarbjit Singh, who was diagnosed with lower limb cellulitis, a bacterial infection, during his holiday in Malaysia in January. After returning to Singapore, the director and chief executive officer of a pest control company saw a general practitioner who advised him to go to a hospital immediately. When he arrived at SGH, the doctor said that his condition was serious. If left untreated, Mr Singh might need to amputate his leg. Mr Singh needed antibiotics to be administered three times a day, and while hospitalisation was recommended, there were no beds available for him at that time. After a day of waiting, Mr Singh was offered the MIC@Home service, which he readily accepted. During his eight days under the programme, he received intravenous antibiotics at home, and the SGH care team went to his house daily three times a day to clean his wound and change bandages until he recovered. “The good part is that when you are home, you get your own food compared to the hospital, (where) sometimes you don’t like the food,” he said. More than that, Mr Singh said the undivided attention the doctor and nurse gave him put him much at ease, and alleviated any worries he might have had. “The doctors who visited me felt less rushed than those in the wards because they only had one patient. They have time to explain and we can ask questions too,” said Mr Singh. He added that MIC@Home makes visiting even more hassle-free as there are no fixed visiting hours, confusing, maze-like buildings to navigate or difficulty in finding parking. Mr Singh’s wife and main caregiver, Ms Jessie Kaur, worked from home while her husband was recovering and “did not feel any stress”. “I knew he was in good hands with the doctors and the nurses,” said the 60-year-old manager at a technology company. “There’s nothing like recovering in your comfort zone, which is at home with your family.” Doctors and healthcare professionals say that there are many benefits to making the MIC@Home service mainstream. Dr Desmond Wai, a gastroenterologist and hepatologist in private practice, noted that while the hospital is a good place to care for those who require intensive treatment, it is not the best place for patient recovery. “The hospital, like I tell my patients, is a dangerous place.” He explained that although he and his nurses follow best practices, such as wearing gloves and washing their hands, patients can still pick up hospital-associated infections, which might even prolong the stay of older, more vulnerable patients. ​Hospital-acquired infections are those caught in a hospital setting, usually occurring 48 hours after admission to the healthcare facility. Furthermore, Dr Wai finds that patients recover better at home, where a familiar environment results in them eating and sleeping better, which aids in their recovery. “A lot of patients tell me, ‘the moment I go home, my appetite improves’. They love to see their children, sit in their favourite chair, hold their favourite mug, have their favourite pillow…(Recovering at) home gives a better, psychological and social environment,” he added. Agreeing, Dr Ko of NUHS said: “There are many benefits to receiving treatments at home rather than in hospitals, especially for the older population.” Apart from better sleep and appetite, patients recovering at home also walk around more — which helps in the healing process. “We know that many older persons who are admitted to the hospital have an increased risk of confusion, decline in their function and getting infections from the hospital,” said Dr Ko. Another doctor , who works in a public hospital and spoke to TODAY on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media, said MIC@Home is a good idea as it “frees up beds for patients that have more acute conditions that have the potential to deteriorate and require round-the-clock care”. Furthermore, this lessens the physical load on both the medical and nursing teams by requiring them to make rounds on fewer patients, said the doctor. A private-practice nurse who also runs the Instagram account SGNightingales added: “Emergency departments are crowded with new cases, including readmissions. With MIC@Home’s assistance, we can provide better follow-up care, reducing hospital admission rates. “This alleviates strain on staff, especially amidst widespread manpower shortages,” the nurse said. While Dr Wai supports MIC@Home going mainstream in hospitals, he is concerned about manpower issues. With doctors and nurses making trips to patients’ homes, he wonders how manpower will be allocated to ensure productivity. Agreeing, the public hospital doctor who did not want to be named added: “Not all patients are technologically savvy, which may take up more time in the initial stages. “But then again, logistics can be improved and streamlined.” In light of MIC@Home becoming mainstream, the various hospitals told TODAY they are in the process of ramping up resources, though they all declined to provide specific figures. NUHS is hiring more staff, especially nurses and doctors who are passionate about integrating hospital care into the community, said Dr Ko . “The CGH@Home team has increased its virtual bed capacity and expanded its care for patients with a wide range of medical acuities,” said Asst Prof See. Ms Oh of KKH said that KKH@Home is also expanding to include more clinical conditions. In order for initiatives like MIC@Home to achieve mainstream success, public perceptions of traditional care need to change. Asst Prof Ang of SSHSPH said: “The public has to be convinced with data and evidence that such a new care model will not compromise their recovery, and also have an open mindset for this paradigm shift in the evolving forms of healthcare in Singapore with the times.” He added that there might be some growing pains, with many initially giving a frosty reception to MIC@Home. However, Singapore has had the benefit of introducing this initiative after Covid-19, where the telehealth and telemonitoring landscape is more advanced, and people are familiar with its mechanisms. Still, while patients and their caregivers who participated in MIC@Home have praised the initiative, some people remain sceptical. Mr Hayden Ng, 33, has not been hospitalised in recent months. But he would still not choose to recover at home if given the option even though he believes MIC@Home is a good initiative to lessen the load for hospitals. The social media manager said that since he is single and lives with his elderly mother, having him recover at home “doesn’t seem like a good idea”. He is not sure that she can cope with the “extra stress and responsibilities needed” for being his caregiver if he chooses MIC@Home. “At the same time, I’d prefer to be near the healthcare staff in case my condition suddenly worsens,” said Mr Ng. “This would give me more peace of mind.” While those under MIC@Home are given a number to call in case of medical emergencies, Mr Ng said this does little to make him feel safe if his medical condition were to take a turn for the worse. “I still need to explain everything to the person on the line for them to fully understand and assess my condition before sending help,” he added. Public relations manager Karina, who declined to give her full name, shared Mr Ng’s sentiments. The 35-year-old said of the programme: “I would feel insecure and a bit uncomfortable if I’m a patient or a family member of a patient. “Being in the hospital makes me feel like I can focus on recovering and not have to worry about anything else. “Conversely, if I’m at home, I overthink and worry about day-to-day stuff. I feel obliged to still go about my usual chores, which I guess may, in a way, hinder my rest and recovery,” she said. While she understands that medical staff are just a phone call or message away, having them physically present or nearby would instantly assuage any doubts or concerns that she has about her recovery. “I’m quite prone to overthinking, and I’d worry that there would be no medical personnel to tend to my questions or help me if I need anything,” she said. The constant worry and monitoring of her condition would also be detrimental to her mental health, which might impede her recovery, she added. While public perception is one factor in ensuring that MIC@Home reaches mainstream success like in the United Kingdom or Canada, Asst Prof Ang said equal consideration must be given to managing the manpower supply and training of healthcare workers. “To ensure the successful implementation of MIC@Home, it does not just require adequate healthcare manpower.” What is also important is to have “healthcare manpower that is trained and able to comfortably adapt to this new mode of care delivery and monitoring of patients in their homes or residences outside of the traditional inpatient ward setting”, he said. Still, some doctors are more sanguine about the move to make home hospitalisations a norm. “People usually think you have to be in a hospital to get treatments like intravenous drips under a doctor’s watchful eye,” added Dr Ko of NUHS. “But we have shown that it is not only possible but that it is also safe and works well, changing how people think about home-based care.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the move to make home hospitalisation a mainstream service in public healthcare. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Ever since the stringent no-visitor rule in hospitals was temporarily imposed at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Paul Osmond George, 46, who has ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy, has had a phobia of being hospitalised. In January, when an upper respiratory tract infection caused a huge fluid build-up in Mr George's body, leading to coughing and vomiting, his cardiologist at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) advised hospitalisation for a more effective diuretic medication treatment. However, given Mr George’s aversion to hospitals, he immediately took up his doctor’s offer — with “no second thoughts or worries” — to recover at home under the Mobile Inpatient Care-at-Home (MIC@Home) pilot, aimed at making “virtual wards” a viable alternative to traditional hospital care. While virtual wards may still be a novelty for many Singaporeans, they are not new — similar models have been widely adopted overseas. Virtual wards were first piloted in England in 2005 and have since been further scaled up by the country's National Health Service, with more than 10,000 virtual beds available. In Australia, the concept has been taken further with the setting up of a standalone virtual hospital in Adelaide. Speaking in Parliament on March 6 during a debate on his ministry's budget, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung announced that from April 1, the MIC@Home service will become \"mainstream\" and be offered as part of public hospitals’ regular services. This follows a successful two-year MIC@Home pilot the Ministry of Health launched in April 2022 as part of ongoing efforts to future-proof the healthcare system in a rapidly ageing Singapore. The pilot was an extension of the Covid-19 Virtual Ward programme launched in September 2021 to free up bed capacity in Singapore's Covid-19 wards for the more seriously ill when Singapore experienced a spike in coronavirus cases. Mr Ong said the rationale behind making MIC@Home mainstream is so that Singapore is not trapped in the mindset of “building hospitals” when thinking about expanding healthcare capacity. “There is potential to better anchor care outside of hospitals and in the community,” said Mr Ong, adding that not all patients require “high-acuity care” and constant monitoring in a hospital throughout their treatment course. In his parliamentary speech, Mr Ong also said that MIC@Home is not set to cost more than a regular hospital stay, and might be projected to cost the same or less. MIC@Home offers eligible patients with certain conditions — such as skin infections, urinary tract infections, and congestive heart failure with fluid overload — the option of being cared for in the comfort of their own homes instead of a hospital ward. Other hospitals that currently offer MIC@Home are Changi General Hospital (CGH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), and hospitals under National University Health System (NUHS). Currently, there are 104 MIC@Home virtual beds across all these hospitals. In response to TODAY's queries, MOH said it aims to provide up to 300 MIC@Home virtual beds this year in light of the move to make it a mainstream service. In turn, public hospitals here told TODAY they are in the process of ramping up resources, though they all declined to provide specific figures. Patients under MIC@Home are generally loaned monitoring devices, namely blood pressure monitoring sets, thermometers, and pulse oximeters. Healthcare workers can monitor patients via a dashboard that contains all the pertinent information on their conditions. Just like a normal hospital ward, a specialist consultant is in charge of every patient admitted to the programme. The consultants work with a team of junior doctors, nurses, therapists, and administrative staff to ensure each patient gets the care and support they need round the clock. Doctors and nurses on the MIC@Home teams do not have any duties in the ward and are solely focused on teleconsultations and home visits. They communicate with patients and their families using messaging platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and phone calls. New mum Fatin Farzana Miswan, 31, decided to make use of the MIC@Home scheme after her baby had jaundice just five days after birth in February. As a first-time parent, the geologist was fraught with anxiety, given her baby’s tender age and the arrangements she and her husband would have to make to visit the child in hospital. “I'll be thinking and worrying about what is happening to my daughter,” said Ms Farzana, “We also don't have a car, so I think it'd be quite difficult for us to commute back and forth to the hospital.” Setting up a “virtual ward” in her home was a seamless process for Ms Farzana. The phototherapy machine was delivered to her flat, before KKH nurses came to advise her on how long to administer phototherapy treatment, and how to take her baby's vital signs and record them on an app. Being connected to the nurses through a WhatsApp group also eased her worries, especially when she had questions about her daughter's care. While the MIC@Home programme allows patients to recover in the comfort of their homes, the knock-on effect of this arrangement is also keenly felt by their caregivers. Mr Adrian Tiam, a 53-year-old private hire driver, felt reassured having his daughter Charlotte recuperate at home in February after she was diagnosed with dengue fever and required hospitalisation due to a dangerously low platelet count of 50,000 per ml. Platelets help to clot a person’s blood and prevent excessive bleeding. When the platelet count is low, one may have trouble stopping bleeding. Since normal platelet counts are between 150,000 and 450,000 per ml. When Charlotte, 16, and Mr Tiam went to CGH, they had to wait 12 hours before she finally got a bed close to midnight and was warded for one night. “I felt nervous and uneasy in a new environment as I had to sleep in the hospital overnight,” said Charlotte. The student was “quite happy” to be told by the CGH@Home team later that while her platelet count was still low, she would be eligible for the pilot programme to recover from home. “I definitely felt well taken care of, as the nurses and doctor would call me if I didn’t take my blood pressure readings at my normal times,” said Charlotte. Mr Tiam said having Charlotte recover at home meant he and his wife could watch over her “24 hours a day”, and did not have to make special arrangements with their work to accommodate the hospital’s visiting hours. Doctors and healthcare professionals say that there are many benefits to making the MIC@Home service mainstream, besides freeing up healthcare capacity in hospitals. For one thing, patients recover better at home, where a familiar environment results in them eating and sleeping better, which aids in their recovery. While patients are recommended to take up MIC@Home, it is still presented as an option and they can decline it at any time. SGH@Home's lead, Dr Michelle Tan, said that some patients have declined to be part of MIC@Home as they are more familiar with receiving medical treatment in the hospital. “This will require a mindset change in patients and their caregivers to accept this new model,” Dr Tan said. Other reasons patients do not take up MIC@Home include the lack of caregiving support at home or if if their home environment is not suitable for the service. Indeed, while patients and their caregivers who participated in MIC@Home have praised the initiative, some people remain sceptical. One of them is Mr Hayden Ng, 33, who has not been hospitalised in recent months. But he would still not choose to recover at home if given the option even though he believes MIC@Home is a good initiative to lessen the load for hospitals. The social media manager said that since he is single and lives with his elderly mother, having him recover at home “doesn’t seem like a good idea”. He is not sure that she can cope with the “extra stress and responsibilities needed” for being his caregiver if he chooses MIC@Home. “At the same time, I’d prefer to be near the healthcare staff in case my condition suddenly worsens,” said Mr Ng. “This would give me more peace of mind.” Experts said that in order for MIC@Home to achieve mainstream success, public perceptions of traditional care need to change. Assistant Professor Ian Ang, from Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said: “The public has to be convinced with data and evidence that such a new care model will not compromise their recovery, and also have an open mindset for this paradigm shift in the evolving forms of healthcare in Singapore with the times.” Still, some doctors are more sanguine about the move to make home hospitalisations a norm. “People usually think you have to be in a hospital to get treatments like intravenous drips under a doctor's watchful eye,” said Dr Stephanie Ko, a consultant at the division of advanced internal medicine at NUHS and lead of NUHS@Home. “But we have shown that it is not only possible but that it is also safe and works well, changing how people think about home-based care.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Two freak accidents involving her brother and nephew on an island north of Manila late last year turned a Filipino domestic helper’s life upside down. The 45-year-old, who has worked in Singapore since 1999, had to find a way to raise around 85,000 pesos (S$2,000) to pay for their surgery and hospitalisation bills. Having previously borrowed S$5,000 from her employer which she later returned, Ms Melissa (not her real name) did not want to make yet another hefty loan request. So she borrowed various sums of money from four different friends and a licensed moneylender from the Philippines, all of whom charged her an interest for their loans. For months, sleep was hard to come by, she said. “I just keep thinking (about) how to pay back all these people.” She briefly considered turning to local moneylenders to do so, but was intimidated by horror stories from myriad peers who said they would do “bad things” to foreign domestic workers who did not pay back their debts on time. Ms Melissa thus decided to roll the dice, quite literally, by turning to online gambling sites. But Lady Luck was disinterested in her prayers, and Ms Melissa’s financial woes worsened, all the while without her employer knowing. She lost more than S$5,000 over four months. “I don’t want to gamble anymore. It was very difficult, very stressful,” she said. She spoke to TODAY on condition of anonymity for fear of getting into trouble with her employer. Ms Monette, 41, another helper who did not want to give her last name for fear of reprisal from her current employer, went through a similar situation in 2018. She borrowed S$500 from a licensed moneylender in Singapore to pay for her mother’s hospital bills back in Manila and struggled to repay her debt. So she borrowed from another moneylender, and then another. Ms Monette ended up owing money to six different moneylenders, including one loan shark. Unfortunately, this precarious financial situation that many foreign domestic workers among the 280,000 here find themselves in is neither uncommon nor new. In 2019, a study commissioned by information services company Experian and Hong Kong charity Enrich found that a third of foreign domestic workers in Singapore were in debt. That same year, the Government revealed that there had been a seven-fold jump in foreigners borrowing from licensed moneylenders from 2016 to 2018. To curb the spike, the Ministry of Law introduced a slew of measures in 2019 including a loan cap for low-income foreigners — limiting the combined amount they can borrow across all moneylenders to just S$500. While the authorities said in 2023 that the number of foreign domestic workers borrowing from licensed moneylenders had “increased but remains low at about 150 borrowers per year” from 2020 to 2022, those borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders was estimated by the Singapore Police Force to be “in the hundreds”, and the figure had been increasing. Charities and maid agencies told TODAY that the overall debt situation for maids “has not improved”, and the measures meant to restrict foreign domestic workers from borrowing from licensed moneylenders might have inadvertently led these workers to find other ways of obtaining money they desperately need. One such charity, Blessed Grace Social Services, said foreign domestic workers seek help from the charity for their financial troubles every week, and there are around 50 who are currently in debt, it said. This increase in borrowing by maids was corroborated by spokespeople from migrant advocacy group Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics and the Association of Employment Agencies (AEAS) as well. Blessed Grace added that it has seen a rise in cases of foreign domestic workers owing money to retail shops which charge “unreasonably exorbitant” interest rates on their products too. As TODAY recently reported , these include jewellery stores such as those in Lucky Plaza which allow foreign domestic workers to buy gold jewellery via instalments without any upfront payment. “The late interest charges sometimes even end up becoming greater than the principal sum, so it becomes an endless cycle of repayment since the late interest charges continue to run. This is also known as a debt trap,” the charity said. Other measures implemented by the Ministry of Law in 2019 include prohibiting licensed moneylenders from targeting low-income foreigners in their advertisements, and restrictions on how many foreigners they can loan money to at any one time. To complement these enforcements, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in 2023 that it has been working closely with various stakeholders to educate migrant workers, including foreign domestic workers, on “prudent financial management practices and the risks and implications of borrowing money”. So why do agencies and charities still see an increasing number of domestic workers in deep financial water? As licensed moneylenders have existing quotas on how many foreigners they can loan to, they tend not to be willing to lend to low-income foreign domestic workers, said Blessed Grace. “Hence, with no legal avenues for the foreign domestic workers to borrow from, they resort to borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, retail companies/shops, and handphone or jewellery shops.” Social media applications like Facebook and TikTok also provide an easy avenue for exploitative businesses and illegal moneylenders to reach foreign domestic workers, and this has exacerbated the problem, said Mr Jeffrey Wong, founder of JForce Employment Agency. Another key factor is the influence of fellow maids. AEAS president K Jayaprema said that “peer relationships” are often more persuasive than the words of caution given by organisations. “When a friend tells another friend: ‘Don't worry, this is okay, I've done this’ — you will just listen,\" she said. “The advice from MOM, the association, or the agency which deploys them at the beginning — how would this stay in somebody's mind, who is at that point, in a desperate need of money?” Another key factor resulting in maids sinking into debt is the outsized responsibility some of them bear in caring for extended family back home who see these workers as an easy source of financial help given the perception that they are earning good money in Singapore. Crucially, foreign domestic workers, who typically earn anywhere from S$500 to just over S$1,000 a month depending on their nationality and experience, often feel the pressure to cede to these requests. “We have very strong family ties. Even my nephews, I have to (pay to) send them to school. I have to help my sister’s family, my brother’s family. That’s our culture. Even if they don’t ask for money, we will give,” said Ms Monette the foreign domestic helper. Such anecdotes from foreign domestic workers, which almost always outline familial pressures to send large portions of their salary home, are indicative of just how financially vulnerable these domestic helpers are. It is therefore important to address the root cause of why foreign domestic workers are getting into debts, said Assistant Professor of Sociology Shannon Ang from Nanyang Technological University, as Singapore has an obligation to care for the well-being of migrant workers who contribute substantially to society. He said that there should be more publicly available data to a llow more independent parties to study the migrant workforce and provide insight into why they may engage in certain practices. On what more can be done to tackle the issue of maids getting into debts, foreign domestic workers, employers, maid agencies, charities and Members of Parliament (MPs) whom TODAY spoke to offered various suggestions. MP for Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency Yip Hon Weng said that the Government \"should do more\" during the interviews that the Centre for Domestic Employees conducts for new workers, as it is an avenue for them to open up about their monetary concerns privately without their employers present, and to provide them with some form of financial counselling. Such a safe environment should extend to the home as well, said migrant workers' rights group Transient Workers Count Too. Preventing foreign domestic workers from getting into debts \"starts at home through a culture of open communication and understanding, so that our helpers feel comfortable sharing their problems, which we may potentially be able to help with before they resort to risky solutions,\" it said. Agreeing, Asst Prof Ang believes that society needs to find ways to enable foreign domestic workers to speak up “more freely” about their conditions, needs, difficulties and aspirations — “all without the fear of facing reprisal”. For Ms Monette, Ms Melissa, Ms Yoon and many others, inculcating a culture of responsible spending through financial literacy could be key to preventing foreign domestic workers from falling into a vicious circle of debts. But educating these helpers in Singapore is just one piece of the puzzle. “Education will help in the long run, but it does not resolve their immediate need to put food on the table back home,” said Mr Ong, the employer, who works in finance. “I think providing an avenue for foreign domestic workers to access short-term, micro loans through government programmes and non-profit organisations will help. Right now, the only options available to foreign domestic workers are exploitative and prey on their desperation.” Ms Foo, the other employer, suggested that it should be mandatory for employers’ consent to be sought if a foreign domestic worker wishes to make certain high value financial transactions like obtaining loans from licensed moneylenders, pawning jewellery, or buying items on instalment plans. The Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (Fast), an MOM-supported charity, said recruitment agencies' can conduct regular workshops on managing debt and unlicensed moneylending could also be conducted for domestic helpers as these agencies are often the workers' first point of contact. It also encourages employers to regularly check in with foreign domestic workers on their financial situation, educate them about the dangers of unlicensed moneylending and refer them to organisations like Fast should they require advice on debt management.

SINGAPORE — Two freak accidents involving her brother and nephew on an island north of Manila late last year turned a Filipino domestic helper’s life upside down. The 45-year-old, who has worked in Singapore since 1999, had to find a way to raise around 85,000 pesos (S$2,000) to pay for their surgery and hospitalisation bills. Having previously borrowed S$5,000 from her employer which she later returned, Ms Melissa (not her real name) did not want to make yet another hefty loan request.

She lost more than S$5,000 over four months. “I don’t want to gamble anymore. It was very difficult, very stressful,” she said. She spoke to TODAY on condition of anonymity for fear of getting into trouble with her employer. Help eventually came in the form of her aunt, also a foreign domestic worker in Singapore, who lent her S$3,000 to pay off all monies owed. With all her debt now consolidated to just her aunt, she said she feels significantly more at ease, and is focused on repaying her debt in the coming months. Ms Monette, 41, another helper who did not want to give her last name for fear of reprisal from her current employer, went through a similar situation in 2018. She borrowed S$500 from a licensed moneylender in Singapore to pay for her mother’s hospital bills back in Manila and struggled to repay her debt. So she borrowed from another moneylender, and then another. Ms Monette ended up owing money to six different moneylenders, including one loan shark. Both Ms Monette and Ms Melissa told TODAY that they know of many fellow maids who are in similar situations — facing piling debts that could spell the end of their working stint in Singapore. This is because foreign domestic workers are prohibited from borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, and will be liable to have their work permits revoked and barred from future employment in the country if they do so, according to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Employers upset with their domestic helpers for getting into debt, or those harassed by moneylenders and fear for their safety, also tend to repatriate them. Unfortunately, this precarious financial situation that many foreign domestic workers find themselves in is not new. In 2019, a study commissioned by information services company Experian and Hong Kong charity Enrich found that a third of foreign domestic workers in Singapore were in debt . That same year, the Government revealed that there had been a sharp rise in foreigners borrowing from licensed moneylenders from 2016 to 2018. In 2016, 7,500 foreigners borrowed from licensed moneylenders. The figure jumped more than seven-fold to 55,000 in 2018, with a further 53,000 borrowing from licensed moneylenders in the first half of 2019 alone. To curb the spike, the Ministry of Law introduced a slew of measures in 2019, including a loan cap for low-income foreigners — limiting the combined amount they can borrow across all moneylenders to just S$500. These measures appear to have worked. The number of foreign domestic workers borrowing from licensed moneylenders had “increased but remains low at about 150 borrowers per year” from 2020 to 2022, MOM said in response to a parliamentary question by Member of Parliament (MP) Seah Kian Peng in February 2023. The ministry also noted, however, that the number of foreign domestic workers borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders was estimated by the Singapore Police Force to be “in the hundreds”, and that the figure had been increasing from 2020 to 2022. The measures meant to restrict foreign domestic helpers from borrowing from licensed moneylenders might have inadvertently led them to find other ways of obtaining money they desperately need, some welfare organisations told TODAY. Indeed, such ways include buying gold jewellery via instalments without any upfront payment at some stores in malls such as Lucky Plaza, then pawning them immediately for a sum of cash, as reported recently by TODAY. Ms Cyndelene Miranda, a 48-year-old Filipino who has been a domestic worker in Singapore for 13 years, said that around a third of her friends have struggled to pay back what they owe these jewellery shops in instalments, due to the high interest rates charged. For instance, one store charges about S$100 in interest for every gram of gold — so a worker would have to pay S$300 for an item containing 3g of gold on top of its selling price. Ms Miranda added that she and her peers also often receive messages via WhatsApp from unknown numbers offering to loan them money; with some maids taking up those offers in desperation. With over 280,000 foreign domestic workers in Singapore today, concerns abound whether society is doing enough to help this vulnerable group of workers. TODAY looks at the factors that lead these foreign domestic workers into debt, why this concerns society at large and what can be done to solve this persistent problem. While there have not been any updated statistics on how many foreign domestic workers are in debt since 2019, several charities and maid employment agencies told TODAY that they have seen a rise in complaints from employers about their maids borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, including loan sharks. One such charity, Blessed Grace Social Services, said that the debt situation “has not improved” in recent years. foreign domestic workers seek help from the charity for their financial troubles every week, and there are around 50 who are currently in debt, it said. Mr Edmund Pooh, general manager of Universal Employment Agency, said it has also noticed an uptick in foreign domestic workers either borrowing or acting as guarantors for money borrowed legally and illegally. The agency would normally receive one or two complaints from employers in a year, Mr Pooh said, but that had gone up to five or six in 2023. This increase in borrowing was corroborated by spokespeople from the Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (Home) and the Association of Employment Agencies (AEAS) as well. However, the Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training (Fast), a charity supported by MOM, said it had not seen a significant change in the number of cases it dealt with regarding debt. Blessed Grace added that it has seen a rise in cases of foreign domestic workers owing money to retail shops — including stores selling jewellery in Lucky Plaza — which charge “unreasonably exorbitant” interest rates on their products too. “The late interest charges sometimes even end up becoming greater than the principal sum, so it becomes an endless cycle of repayment since the late interest charges continue to run. This is also known as a debt trap,” the charity said. Sitting alongside the struggles that domestic helpers face when they end up in debt is the tricky predicament that employers find themselves in as well. Mr Joseph Ong, whose helper of 10 years was saddled with around S$1,000 in debt this year, said that she was often “distracted and looking troubled” because of it. Mr Ong, who is in his 40s, ended up paying her outstanding payments. For hairdresser Rachelle Foo and her family, their former domestic helper of 14 years would often ask Ms Foo’s parents for four to six months’ worth of salary in advance, and borrow sums of money from her and her siblings too. Ms Foo said that the maid would spend her days crying at home when she was short of money, which the latter said was because of family emergencies back home in Indonesia. “We hired her mainly to look after our grandma, who is 106 years old, just in case anything happens when we are out at work,” she said. “Our main concern was whether she could focus on her work, and whether her money problems would be recurring … There’s only so much we can help (financially).” Regrettably, despite the family consistently providing loans when she needed them, their helper eventually resorted to stealing their jewellery and cash in 2023 — which Ms Foo called a “traumatic” experience as they had regarded her as part of the household. Their former helper was sentenced to 14 months’ jail last Thursday (March 21). Employers may also end up being harassed or even threatened by loan sharks for repayment of their maids’ debts, which can leave them feeling unsafe and vulnerable. In such cases, they typically have to bear the costs to send their domestic helper home and hire a replacement. In addition to limiting the amount that low-income foreigners (who earn less than S$10,000 a year) can borrow to S$500, the Ministry of Law implemented other measures in 2019 to prohibit licensed moneylenders from targeting these workers in their advertisements. Starting Aug 16 of that year, they are not allowed to lend to more than 300 foreigners and up to S$150,000 in total loans to foreigners at any one time. To complement these enforcements, the MOM said in 2023 that it has been working closely with various stakeholders to educate migrant workers, including foreign domestic workers, on “prudent financial management practices and the risks and implications of borrowing money”. This is done through the mandatory Settling-In-Programme for all first-time foreign domestic workers, guidebooks like the Money Management Guide for Migrant Domestic Workers, regular newsletters, and by educating employers to advise their foreign domestic workers to stay away from unlicensed moneylenders. The ministry also has a dedicated TikTok account for foreign domestic workers, “Friends_SgMDW”, which posts videos in domestic helpers’ native languages to warn them about scams and offer avenues where they can reach out for help if they face financial troubles. Several of their videos have even racked up over two million views. Additionally, around 300 member agencies of the AEAS — which the association says handles about 70 per cent of all foreign domestic workers placed in Singapore — remind workers not to borrow money through illegal means as part of their “orientation checklist”. So why do agencies and charities still see an increasing number of domestic workers in deep financial water? As licensed moneylenders have existing quotas on how many foreigners they can loan to, they tend not to be willing to lend to low-income foreign domestic workers, said Blessed Grace. “Hence, with no legal avenues for the foreign domestic workers to borrow from, they resort to borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders, retail companies/shops, and handphone or jewellery shops.” Social media applications like Facebook and TikTok also provide an easy avenue for exploitative businesses and illegal moneylenders to reach foreign domestic workers, and this has exacerbated the problem, said Mr Jeffrey Wong, founder of JForce Employment Agency. Another key factor is the influence of fellow foreign domestic workers. AEAS president K Jayaprema said that “peer relationships” are often more persuasive than the words of caution given by organisations. “When a friend tells another friend: ‘Don't worry, this is okay, I've done this’ — you will just listen,\" she said. “The advice from MOM, the association, or the agency which deploys them at the beginning — how would this stay in somebody's mind, who is at that point, in a desperate need of money?” Mr Wong from JForce agreed, saying: “No matter how much we teach them, I can’t fight with their friends because they are with them (so often) — on Facebook Messenger, TikTok, forums… (They think) since everyone is doing that, why not me?” Another key reason why foreign domestic workers sink into debt is the outsized responsibility some of them bear in caring for extended family back home, some of whom see these workers as an easy source of financial help given the perception that they are earning good money in Singapore. Foreign domestic workers typically earn anything from S$500 to just over S$1,000 a month depending on their nationality and experience, according to agencies that TODAY spoke to. For domestic helpers who come from Myanmar, the country’s political instability amid the Covid-19 pandemic in recent years is another factor why they feel a financial strain. Ms Yoon Wai Wai Khin, a 31-year-old domestic helper, used to earn a monthly salary of S$500 in 2021 and would send nearly all of her earnings back home to Bago each month, occasionally leaving her with just S$10 in the bank. Her father, the other breadwinner in her family who drives for a living, was unable to work due to the Myanmar government’s restrictions, and Ms Yoon was forced to borrow money from her employer to help her family of five survive. The picture painted by Ms Yoon of the familial pressure to give almost everything they have to their loved ones is a familiar one to foreign domestic workers, regardless of their nationality. “The main reason (for being in debt) is our family needs in the Philippines,” said a 33-year-old domestic helper from Nueva Ecija, who wanted to be known only as Ms Jane. She had borrowed from a total of five different moneylenders and a loan shark to pay for her son’s hospital bills in 2018 after her employer rejected her request for a salary advance. Not being able to repay her debts, she was repeatedly harassed by moneylenders through text messages which contained many “nasty words”. But Ms Jane felt that she did not have any other choice back then. “We want to support them even though we don’t have anything here. We try our best to give them what we have, without even realising that we are the ones who fall into trouble,” she said. Both Ms Jane and Ms Monette managed to find support with Blessed Grace Social Services, which enrolled them in a “debt consolidation programme” where a third-party company helped to pay off their existing loans. Foreign domestic workers under this programme would then be able to repay monies owed to just one party, as opposed to many, on a more manageable schedule. Reflecting on what they went through over five years ago, both women said that they have learned to turn down their family’s requests when they do not have the means to help, even if it is tough to do so. “We have very strong family ties. Even my nephews, I have to (pay to) send them to school. I have to help my sister’s family, my brother’s family. That’s our culture. Even if they don’t ask for money, we will give,” said Ms Monette. She added: “Now if I don’t have money, I say no… I’m very thankful that I don’t have debt (now), and I have money for emergencies, something to take out from my bank. “As much as possible, we want our fellow domestic helpers to learn financial literacy… and that it’s okay to say no if we don’t have (money) — we cannot give everything.” Such anecdotes from foreign domestic workers, which almost always outline familial pressures to send large portions of their salary home, are indicative of just how financially vulnerable these domestic helpers are. The occasional family emergency further adds to their susceptibility of getting into debt or being preyed upon by businesses. It is important to address the root cause of why foreign domestic workers are getting into debts, said Assistant Professor of Sociology Shannon Ang from Nanyang Technological University, as Singapore has an obligation to care for the well-being of migrant workers who contribute substantially to society. On what more can be done to tackle the issue of maids getting into debts, foreign domestic workers, employers, maid agencies, charities and MPs whom TODAY spoke to offered various suggestions. MP for Yio Chu Kang Single Member Constituency Yip Hon Weng said that the Government \"should do more\" during the interviews that the Centre for Domestic Employees conducts for new workers, as it is an avenue for them to open up about their monetary concerns privately without their employers present, and to provide them with some form of financial counselling. Mr Yip had posed a parliamentary question in May 2021 to then Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on how to ensure foreign domestic worker s would be able \"to honestly share their concerns\", to which Ms Teo responded in writing that the centre would \"endeavour to create a safe environment\" and that it aimed to conduct all interviews in foreign domestic worker s' native languages to ensure they are understood. Such a safe environment should extend to the home as well, said migrant workers' rights group Transient Workers Count Too. Preventing foreign domestic worker s from getting into debts \"starts at home through a culture of open communication and understanding, so that our helpers feel comfortable sharing their problems, which we may potentially be able to help with before they resort to risky solutions,\" it said. Agreeing, Asst Prof Ang believes that society needs to find ways to enable foreign domestic workers to speak up “more freely” about their conditions, needs, difficulties and aspirations — “all without the fear of facing reprisal”. For Ms Monette, Ms Melissa, Ms Yoon and many foreign domestic workers, inculcating a culture of responsible spending through financial literacy could be key to preventing foreign domestic workers from falling into a vicious cycle of debts. But educating these helpers in Singapore is just one piece of the puzzle. “Education will help in the long run, but it does not resolve their immediate need to put food on the table back home,” said Mr Ong, the employer, who works in finance. “I think providing an avenue for foreign domestic workers to access short-term, micro loans through government programmes and non-profit organisations will help. Right now, the only options available to foreign domestic workers are exploitative and prey on their desperation.” Agreeing, the charity Blessed Grace believes having legal avenues for money lending will prevent foreign domestic workers from falling victim to abuse and exploitation. Ms Foo, the other employer, suggested that it should be mandatory for employers’ consent to be sought if a foreign domestic worker wishes to make certain high value financial transactions like obtaining loans from licensed moneylenders, pawning jewellery, or buying items on instalment plans. “Now, they can do so as long as they have their work permit. But these (transactions are mostly) behind the employer’s back,” she said, adding that employers would have to bear the consequences should things go south. In addition to recruitment agencies' existing efforts to remind foreign domestic workers not to borrow, regular workshops on managing debt and unlicensed moneylending could also be conducted for domestic helpers as these agencies are often the workers' first point of contact, said the MOM-supported charity Fast. It also encourages employers to regularly check in with foreign domestic workers on their financial situation, educate them about the dangers of unlicensed moneylending and refer them to organisations like Fast should they require advice on debt management. Ultimately, in order for society to propose constructive solutions to foreign domestic workers' debt problems, Asst Prof Ang of NTU said there should be more publicly available data to “comprehensively understand their current situation and how it might change in the future”. MOM had previously released three runs of the Migrant Domestic Worker and Migrant Domestic Worker Employer Study (in 2010, 2015-16, and 2021), which aims to offer insights into the employment experiences of foreign domestic workers in Singapore, and their awareness of their employment rights and responsibilities. Its most recent study in 2021 found that over 99 per cent of foreign domestic workers surveyed were satisfied with working and living in Singapore, and would recommend their family and friends to work here as a domestic helper. The figure was 97 per cent in 2015. But Asst Prof Ang noted that the study’s findings “do not allow us to properly study relationships between issues like verbal/physical abuse, privacy, mental well-being, and other employment conditions”. “Allowing more independent parties to study the migrant workforce, whether through sharing of data or through facilitating access to the population, will provide insight into why they may engage in certain practices and allow us to better address them,” he said.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Although he began cycling using BMX bicycles in his teenage years, Mr Muzzamel Mazidee felt the urge to upgrade to a more expensive model only when he was in his mid-20s. Although interest in cycling in general has abated since its peak during the Covid-19 pandemic, the subculture surrounding premium bicycles — which cost upwards of S$5,000 apiece — is still going strong, according to those in the fraternity. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Although he began cycling using BMX bicycles in his teenage years, Mr Muzzamel Mazidee felt the urge to upgrade to a more expensive model only when he was in his mid-20s. That lightbulb moment arrived in 2019 as he and his friends were cycling on the road, and he found himself unable to catch up with them. While he was riding a commuter bike, they were riding road bikes, which are generally lighter and speedier. “The moment I could not catch up, I knew that apart from my fitness, I also was not on the right type of bike,” said the 31-year-old general manager of a tech startup. Mr Muzzamel decided to go for a S$3,000 bicycle — a mid-range model of the American brand Specialized he had chosen — as he felt that he would have been tempted to spend more money to frequently upgrade the bike if he were to start with an entry-level range anyway. Fast forward to May 2023, and he nonetheless upgraded to a bespoke bicycle from Australian brand Bastion. With a name like Superleggera and using ultra light carbon fibre material, the top-end model cost Mr Muzzamel about S$30,000 to put together. While having a custom-made bicycle means it will be carefully put together taking into account one’s physical measurements to give as comfortable a riding experience as possible, Mr Muzzamel said there was more to the purchase as well. “Having a bespoke bike is almost similar to having an art piece,” he said, comparing it to how other people may indulge in other forms of high-value items like watches or cars. While his willingness to splurge on a two-wheel pedalling machine may raise some eyebrows, Mr Muzzamel is not alone; there are many others like him who burn rubber a few times each week on a tour de Singapore riding high-end bicycles in groups. Although interest in cycling in general has abated since its peak during the Covid-19 pandemic, the subculture surrounding premium bicycles — which cost upwards of S$5,000 apiece — is still going strong, according to those in the fraternity. Beyond going for rides in groups here or overseas, some of these avid cyclists spend significant amounts upgrading or modifying their gears, for various reasons such as better performance. Others also routinely post their adventures via dedicated social media accounts, which are also used by various cycling groups to organise rides and showcase their activities. Premium bikes and their eye-watering price tags recently attracted public attention here again, albeit in a less positive light, after it was reported that a S$7,900 foldable Brompton bicycle was allegedly gifted to former transport minister S Iswaran who is currently facing corruption charges. The same British brand of bikes had previously come under the spotlight when it emerged in 2012 that the National Parks Board had bought 26 of this brand of bicycles at S$2,200 each, leading the public to question whether the agency got value for its purchases. This case also resulted in a former National Parks Board officer to be charged and later fined S$5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with a bicycle firm director. More recently, Brompton is also sponsoring for the first time a new race category in the upcoming OCBC Cycle event this year, dubbed the Foldie Ride. To date it is the only adult category race that has been fully subscribed. What might be less known to those outside the cycling circle is that while S$7,900 or S$2,200 are not small sums, they represent just a fraction of how much some cycling enthusiasts are willing to spend on their hobby. In fact, there are even bicycle wheelsets alone that come with five-figure price tags. Some high-end components such electronic groupsets can also cost over S$5,000. The reasons for the willingness to pour big money into these bikes vary; from utilitarian ones such as better-build quality and resale value, to intangible ones such as peer influence and sheer passion, according to retailers and cyclists TODAY spoke to. But who exactly are these diehards? While many of them are mainly middle-aged male professionals with money to spare, over the years more women and younger riders have also entered the fold, said those in the fraternity. Their motivation for spending time and money on this pastime goes beyond the health benefits that naturally come with the activity, cyclists told TODAY. The activity also allows them to expand their social and professional networks, though the cyclists described this as more of an inadvertent benefit. Still, they stressed that underneath the occasionally uniformed lycra and pricey equipment — which might look formidable to those outside their circle — they are a diverse and welcoming group. Ms Tiffany Lau, a 27-year-old avid cyclist and content creator who currently uses a Basso bicycle sponsored by a local shop that retails for around S$7,000, said: “Honestly, my group has higher-end bike riders, too, but they are friendly and would not judge others based on gear.” Bicycles mostly have just two wheels but the price disparity between different brands can be like night and day. For example, premium folded bikes like Bromptons and Birdys carry a listed retail price of anywhere between S$2,000 and S$8,300, compared to the more mass-market variants that can cost as low as about S$300. Similarly, road bikes of the more affordable variety can retail for about S$700 here. At the other end of the price spectrum, a premium bicycle frame alone can cost more than S$10,000, excluding other components such as a groupset (cranks, brakes, derailleurs, gear shifters and so on), wheels, handlebars and saddles that cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars per part. For instance, a handlebar from Italian brand Pinarello retails for about S$1,500. Costlier bicycles typically use higher-end components. Most are also made of carbon fibre — a strong, lightweight material — as opposed to aluminium for mass consumer bikes. High-end bicycles can weigh as light as 6.5kg, less than half of mass market ones. Naturally, those who willing to fork out the moolah for such costly machines would typically also splurge on cycling apparel. While a nondescript cycling jersey can cost under S$30, a branded top from the likes of Pas Normal Studios, Rapha or Maap can easily cost more than 10 times that. Prices for helmets, bibs, sunglasses and shoes are no less steep, which means that one can easily spend over S$1,000 to be decked out in branded cycling apparel from head to toe. As it turns out, cyclists and retailers alike said that there are tangible reasons to spend big bucks on their rides. Mr Desmond Cheong, head of retail at Specialized, said: “If a bike has gone through more research and innovation, there's a performance benefit. And when there's a performance benefit, that’s what you pay for. So that's where the pricing varies.” Specialized offers a broad range of two-wheelers with prices ranging from around S$2,000 for its entry-level offerings to S$20,000 for its highest-end S-Works range. As for the popularity of Bromptons, its managing director for Asia Pacific region Mark Smedley said that it has been driven by “a growing emphasis on sustainable and efficient urban transportation solutions”. “This uptrend reflects a shift towards compact and versatile options, aligning with Singapore's focus on eco-friendly mobility initiatives.” On why they appeal better to certain consumers over a more affordable folding bike, Mr Smedley said that while Brompton offers premium products, “it is everything around it that makes our brand special”. “As a B Corp we are really driven by our values, our commitment to our customers, our own people, our planet, and our partners to be a business for good,” he said. A B Corporation refers to a company that is certified and has voluntarily met the highest standards for social and environmental performance. There are various cycling groups on social media set up by Brompton enthusiasts. These include Brompton_Riders@SG, a Facebook group which has about 15,000 members. Mr Eugene Lim, an avid Brompton bicycle rider since 2010, said: “Value wise, as the bicycle is very well built and manufactured to last, amortising a good bike over 10 years offers more value than a S$500 bike which will not last more than three years.” Mr Lim is also a director at Camp High Achievers, a training consultancy firm which has sold Brompton bikes and offered related services such as guided tours since 2020. Another pragmatic reason for buying more famous higher-end bicycles is that they tend to sell better in the resale market than their lesser-known counterparts. OLC, a 31-year-old avid cyclist who runs bicycle-focused YouTube channel under the moniker Oompa Loompa, sold his first bicycle and used the proceeds to fund a higher priced bicycle. In picking his second bicycle frame, brand reputation again played on his mind. “I know that because of the brand name, people out there will still want to buy it (if I sell it later), as it is a reputable brand. Unlike buying an unknown frame, where the depreciation is much higher,” said OLC, who declined to give his full name as being a mysterious, masked character is part of his YouTube persona. However, as with any products, there are aspirational aspects behind the decision to spend on big-ticket items as well. Ms Lau, who works in the aviation industry, spent over S$3,000 on her Giant bicycle and related accessories when she started road cycling two and a half years ago. A significant sum no doubt — but still modest compared to some others. “I mean, I have friends who ride S$20,000 bicycles and whenever there’s a new (bicycle) jersey launch, they spend S$1,000 to S$2,000 on buying a new jersey,” she said. This is akin to how other people might splurge on branded bags or watches because they like them, she added. While Ms Lau noted that a “cheap bike” can still go far, “a lot of times we often go for brands and designs that we like”. Giant, founded in Taiwan, is one of the largest producer of bicycles in the world. Other popular high end brands here for road bikes would include Trek, Specialized, Cervelo, Canyon, Bianchi, Factor and Pinarello, the Italian brand which is sometimes touted as the Ferrari of bicycles. Despite paying a hefty price tag, some cyclists acknowledged that not everyone can feel or benefit from the improved performance that higher-end gear can offer, as it would depend on other fundamentals such as one’s physical stamina and cycling technique. OLC, who regularly interviews cyclists for his YouTube channel, said he has come across a number who said that they buy certain bicycle brands as they would like to imitate their favourite athletes, or simply for the brand “prestige or heritage”. And as some put it, such expensive purchases are just a case of desire meeting spending power. “As with any hobby, if one is passionate about it, you'll be willing to spend a significant amount of time and money on it,” said Mr David Ho, coordinator of cycling group West Coast Riders, which welcomes cyclists of varying riding competencies. “However, the amount one spends really depends on what you want to achieve out of it, and the affordability (to you).” West Coast Riders has over 3,400 members on Facebook. Between 70 and 150 cyclists would take part in their rides, which happen three times a week. In most cycling groups here such as West Coast Riders, each ride can stretch for anything from 40km to 80km, with cyclists grouped according to their rolling speeds, which can range from 20kmh to nearly 40kmh. TODAY reported last year that cycling activities and bicycle sales in general have declined from its Covid-19 peak. Mr Eric Ng, a professional airbrush artist of 18 years whose shop Paint Extreme does mainly custom artwork for premium bikes, said that the decline is due to “impulsive buyers” leaving the market as other leisure activities opened up after the pandemic. Mr Azhar Abdullah, Treknology3’s retail, marketing and distribution manager said that the “entry to mid-segment” bikes were the ones that saw the most fluctuation, as these were the bicycles that casual cyclists back then went for. Treknology3 is the authorised distributor of bicycles from popular American brand Trek, which produces mass consumer models as well as high-end ones used by professional race cyclists. Mr Kenneth Tan, co-owner of high-end bike dealer Cycleworx, said that the drop has been so drastic that some shops are selling their stocks at a loss, or closing down entirely. In the past year, cycling as a sport has seen a “market correction” back to pre-pandemic levels, with some signs of gradual growth, retailers told TODAY recently. Meanwhile, demand from the more “serious” cyclists who have been investing in gear, has remained largely steady through the years, the retailers said. So, who are these loyal consumers of high-end gear, attire and even bike customisation services? One term popularised since around the 2010s to describe such cyclists is Mamil — middle-aged men in Lycras. According to most cyclists and retailers, this group still make up a significant number of their consumers. Mr Tan of Cycleworx, a dealer for Pinarellos that typically retail for five-figure sums , said the bulk of his customers are still male professionals, usually in their late 30s and above. But female riders, and younger riders across genders, are also a growing demographic among avid cyclists over the years. Music educator and avid cyclist Melodie Ng said: \"I would see three guys to every one lady (per group). I think previously this would have been much less.\" Co-founder of Cycle Project Store, Sherwin Ng, also noted a \"refreshing\" increase in female riders in the otherwise male-dominated scene since the Covid-19 pandemic. \"The increase could also be due to social media, better gears designed for women such as apparel, equipment and so on,\" said Mr Ng. Mr Gino Abano, managing director for Specialized Asiahub, cautioned against presuming a link between having financial means and a willingness to spend. “I can think of a number of people, who are not exactly big executives, owning the most expensive bikes. And it’s also true the other way around,” he said. “I think it’s less to do with income or profile, and more to do with how interested they are in riding the bike and what they want out of it.” Mr Azhar of Treknology3 added that the barrier to buying pricier bicycles nowadays is also lower with the availability of easier payment options. “We see more people using the instalment option as well. But I will say for us as a business we don't really see a big jump,” he said. As premium bike groups in Singapore attract more followers, is high-end cycling becoming the “new golf” here? The concept of networking on wheels — bandied around since at least the 2010s — refers to individuals using cycling as a means to extend their professional networks, given that people who can afford to splurge on leisurely activities are likely to be well-heeled or established in their careers. While cyclists and retailers here agreed that people may cycle to connect for professional reasons, they differed on the extent of such a practice, and whether the networking that developed is by design or accident. Mr Ng of Paint Extreme described high-end bike cycling as a “second golf”, as it offers potential opportunities to mingle with high-profile professionals or business leaders. Compared to signing up for a country club membership, or partaking in other activities that the rich may indulge in like driving luxury cars, buying a performance bike is something more accessible to even “those with just above average income”, he added. Still, others said that the majority who commit to cycling do it for the company and the joy of the activity. Networking, if it does happen, occurs inadvertently, they added. Mr Tan of Cycleworx said those who deliberately join cycling groups for the sake of networking tend to stand out from cyclists who are actually passionate about the sport, and tend to number \"just one or two\" in a group. \"They also usually don't last long,\" added Mr Tan, a former SEA Games medallist in the late 1980s to mid 1990s. Mr Muzzamel said that even though he sees high net worth individuals in his group, he cycles first and foremost “to get away from work”. As he expects that other professionals also feel the same about cycling, he refrains from talking shop with them. However, he also acknowledged that if one were to mix among the right group of people, you are “bound to” to meet with certain people that they can potentially find certain business dealings with. This applies to cycling or any social group. Riders said that going cycling is no different from other forms of hanging out with friends — except that this particular group of people share a common interest in bicycles. Still, some of those interviewed noted that there are groups which project a more “elitist” image than others, given their preference for certain expensive brands and their penchant for posting Instagrammable photos and videos on social media showing their gear, group rides as well as gatherings at hip cafes. Music educator Melodie Ng noted that bike brands also organise rides limited to cyclists who own those brands, which she reckoned was for photography and promotional purposes. However, cyclists interviewed noted that even such cycling groups affiliated to particular brands organise specific “social nights” or rides that are open to people who do not use their gears. Regardless, forming smaller passionate groups around certain brands is not exclusive to just cycling, they said — no different from photographers using the same camera brand going for photo walks together or convoys of motorbikes of the same brand riding together. Membership growth happens organically, and any form of screening, if at all, is for practical and safety purposes, said the cyclists. For example, Ms Ng said the first group that she joined four and a half years ago was organised by the shop she had bought her bicycle from. From there, joining another group is typically done by introduction through friends. “Safety is actually quite a concern when it comes to riding with people that you don't know. So generally, we (the group) would make sure that this person has some kind of experience riding before allowing them to join us,” said the 35-year-old who is a member of the cycling group called No Pressure Pressure Club. On top of riding, chilling, chatting and swooning over the newest and shiniest gear together, a growing number of riders are also manifesting their passion for their two-wheelers through content creation. OLC, Ms Lau and Ms Ng have all been uploading cycling-related contents on their various social media platforms. OLC’s Oompa Loompa YouTube channel that features interviews with other bikers and gear reviews, has gathered almost 19,000 subscribers, a “sizeable number” but not enough to “replace a day job”, he said. For Ms Ng, while she started road cycling a few years ago upon the recommendation of an ex-colleague to try the sport, she has “become like a (content) creator of sorts”. “Not everyone obviously does it that way. It just happens to be what I'm interested in, I love making videos,” said Ms Ng, who has 4,700 followers on Instagram. Ms Lau has about 9,000 followers on her tiffylauonwheels Instagram account. Mr Dean Koh, vice-president for media and publicity at the Singapore Cycling Federation said that “the rise of cycling influencers” is one of two factors that has contributed to the high-end bicycle subculture here. The other factor, he said, is the proliferation of local cycling clubs that keep cyclists “active in their passion” by organising regular group rides. Retailers here noted that some of the local cyclists’ preference towards more premium rides is not too dissimilar from that of other markets. Mr Cheong of Specialized said that comparing Singapore with other markets, there is no drastic difference in demand for their various tiers of bicycles. However, anecdotal evidence points to cyclists here having a more upmarket taste in bikes than those in neighbouring countries. Ms Lau, for example, said that when she goes cycling in Bangkok and meets avid cyclists there, she notices that Singaporean riders tend to have more expensive bikes than their Thai counterparts. Mr Gary Gleason, vice-president of sales at American mountain bicycle brand Wilderness Trail Bikes, noted that his company serves high-end riders who use upscale accessories in Singapore. “It seems that the market is really kind of catered towards a more premium product,” he was reported as saying at the recent Taipei Cycle 2024, Asia’s biggest bicycle trade show. Mr Ng of Cycle Project Store added: \"The cycling community here in the Southeast Asian region are fast paced with their consumption of products and generally after the newest or latest release as compared to certain part of the world.\" While those in the fraternity believe that the subculture surrounding premium bikes in Singapore is here to stay — given its resilience throughout the pandemic — some reiterated the importance of not losing sight of the wider cycling populace here, too. Active mobility expert Tham Chen Munn, a former vice-president for recreation at the Singapore Cycling Federation, said that while the Lycra-clad road riders with their expensive bicycles may be more prominent, there is also the “unsung, unseen” group of bike users who ride around the neighbourhoods on shared paths. “And when the Park Connector Network continues to expand, who does this benefit? It’s the uncles and aunties and families who use these paths, not the road cyclists,” he said. Mr Koh of SCF added that those who are bitten by the cycling bug but are more budget conscious, can always turn to the resale market for good deals or big retailers that offer more affordably priced equipment to get started on the hobby. At the end of the day, Mr Tham reiterated that cycling is still an activity for all and not something reserved for the more affluent. Agreeing, Mr Ho of West Coast Riders said: “You can still cycle with a low- cost bike, accessories and kits. However, if you want to follow trends, or keep up with the Joneses, then the sky's the limit. “The main reasons (for cycling) will still be the same: Fitness, social bonding and adventure.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

While he was riding a commuter bike, they were riding road bikes, which are generally lighter and speedier. “The moment I could not catch up, I knew that apart from my fitness, I also was not on the right type of bike,” said the 31-year-old general manager of a technology startup. Mr Muzzamel decided to go for a S$3,000 bicycle — a mid-range model of the American brand Specialized he had chosen — as he felt that he would have been tempted to spend more money to frequently upgrade the bike if he were to start with an entry-level range anyway. Fast forward to May 2023, and he nonetheless upgraded to a bespoke bicycle from Bastion. With a name like Superleggera and using ultra light carbon fibre material, the top-end model from the Australian brand cost Mr Muzzamel about S$30,000 to put together. While having a custom-made bicycle means it will be carefully put together taking into account one’s physical measurements to give as comfortable a riding experience as possible, Mr Muzzamel said there was more to the purchase as well. “Having a bespoke bike is almost similar to having an art piece,” he said, comparing it to how other people may indulge in other forms of high-value items like watches or cars. While his willingness to splurge on a two-wheel pedalling machine may raise some eyebrows, Mr Muzzamel is not alone; there are many others like him who burn rubber in groups a few times each week on a tour de Singapore riding high-end bicycles. Although interest in cycling in general has abated since its peak during the Covid-19 pandemic, the subculture surrounding premium bicycles — which cost upwards of S$5,000 apiece — is still going strong, according to those in the fraternity. Premium bikes and their eye-watering price tags recently attracted public attention here again, albeit in a less positive light, after it was reported that a S$7,900 foldable Brompton bicycle was allegedly gifted to former transport minister S Iswaran who is currently facing corruption charges. The same British brand of bikes had previously come under the spotlight when it emerged in 2012 that the National Parks Board had bought 26 of this brand of bicycles at S$2,200 each, leading the public to question whether the agency got value for its purchases. This case also resulted in a former National Parks Board officer to be charged and later fined S$5,000 for lying to auditors about his relationship with a bicycle firm director. More recently, Brompton is also sponsoring for the first time a new race category in the upcoming OCBC Cycle event this year, dubbed the Foldie Ride. To date it is the only adult category race that has been fully subscribed. Mr Dean Koh, vice-president for media and publicity at the Singapore Cycling Federation said that “the rise of cycling influencers” is one of two factors that has contributed to the high-end bicycle subculture here. The other factor, he said, is the proliferation of local cycling clubs that keep cyclists “active in their passion” by organising regular group rides. Bicycles mostly have just two wheels but the price disparity between different brands can be like night and day. Road bikes of the more affordable variety can retail for about S$700 here. At the other end of the price spectrum, a premium bicycle frame alone can cost more than S$10,000, excluding other components such as a groupset (cranks, brakes, derailleurs, gear shifters and so on), wheels, handlebars and saddles that cost in the hundreds or thousands of dollars per part. To complete the look, these cyclists would also splurge on cycling apparel and other accessories that can easily add up to over S$1,000. As it turns out, cyclists and retailers alike said that there are tangible reasons to spend big bucks on their rides. Mr Desmond Cheong, head of retail at Specialized, said: “If a bike has gone through more research and innovation, there's a performance benefit. And when there's a performance benefit, that’s what you pay for. So that's where the pricing varies.” Another pragmatic reason for buying more famous higher-end bicycles is that they tend to sell better in the resale market than their lesser-known counterparts. However, as with any products, there are aspirational aspects behind the decision to spend on big-ticket items as well. Ms Tiffany Lau, a 27-year-old avid cyclist and content creator who currently uses a bicycle sponsored by a local shop that retails for around S$7,000, said: “I have friends who ride S$20,000 bicycles and whenever there’s a new (bicycle) jersey launch, they spend S$1,000 to S$2,000 on buying a new jersey,” she said. This is akin to how other people might splurge on branded bags or watches because they like them, she added. While Ms Lau noted that a “cheap bike” can still go far, “a lot of times we often go for brands and designs that we like”. So, who are these loyal consumers of high-end gear, attire and even bike customisation services? One term popularised since around the 2010s to describe such cyclists is Mamil — middle-aged men in Lycras. According to most cyclists and retailers, this group still make up a significant number of their consumers. But female riders, and younger riders across genders, are also a growing demographic among avid cyclists over the years. Music educator and avid cyclist Melodie Ng, 35, said: \"I would see three guys to every one lady (per group). I think previously this would have been much less.\" While cyclists and retailers here agreed that people may cycle to connect for professional reasons — some describing cycling as a “new golf” — they differed on the extent of such a practice, and whether the networking that developed is by design or accident. On top of riding, chilling, chatting and swooning over the newest and shiniest gear together, a growing number of riders are also manifesting their passion for their two-wheelers through content creation. One cyclist who goes by the online moniker Oompa Loompa runs a YouTube channel that features interviews with other bikers and gear reviews. The channel has gathered almost 19,000 subscribers, a “sizeable number” but not enough to “replace a day job”, he said. Retailers here noted that some of the local cyclists’ preference towards more premium rides is not too dissimilar from that of other markets. Mr Cheong of Specialized said that comparing Singapore with other markets, there is no drastic difference in demand for their various tiers of bicycles. However, anecdotal evidence points to cyclists here having a more upmarket taste in bikes than those in neighbouring countries. Ms Lau, for example, said that when she goes cycling in Bangkok and meets avid cyclists there, she notices that Singaporean riders tend to have more expensive bikes than their Thai counterparts. Mr Gary Gleason, vice-president of sales at American mountain bicycle brand Wilderness Trail Bikes, noted that his company serves high-end riders who use upscale accessories in Singapore. “It seems that the market is really kind of catered towards a more premium product,” he was reported as saying at the recent Taipei Cycle 2024, Asia’s biggest bicycle trade show. While those in the fraternity believe that the subculture surrounding premium bikes in Singapore is here to stay — given its resilience throughout the pandemic — some reiterated the importance of not losing sight of the wider cycling populace here, too. Active mobility expert Tham Chen Munn, a former vice-president for recreation at the Singapore Cycling Federation, said that while the Lycra-clad road riders with their expensive bicycles may be more prominent, there is also the “unsung, unseen” group of bike users who ride around the neighbourhoods on shared paths. “And when the Park Connector Network continues to expand, who does this benefit? It’s the uncles and aunties and families who use these paths, not the road cyclists,” he said. Mr Koh of the Singapore Cycling Federation added that those who are bitten by the cycling bug but are more budget conscious can always turn to the resale market for good deals or big retailers that offer more affordably priced equipment to get started on the hobby. At the end of the day, Mr Tham reiterated that cycling is still an activity for all and not something reserved for the more affluent. Agreeing, Mr David Ho, coordinator of cycling group West Coast Riders, said: “You can still cycle with a low-cost bike, accessories and kits. However, if you want to follow trends, or keep up with the Joneses, then the sky's the limit. “The main reasons (for cycling) will still be the same: Fitness, social bonding and adventure.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Before making a phone call, 26-year-old Nivani Elangovan would prepare herself by mentally mapping out what could happen during the tele-conversation and jotting down pointers on post-it notes for reference. Youths interviewed by TODAY say they prefer texting to phone calls for both social and workplace communication. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Before making a phone call, 26-year-old Nivani Elangovan would prepare herself by mentally mapping out what could happen during the tele-conversation and jotting down pointers on post-it notes for reference. Typing a phone number into her seldom-used call app on her handphone is an anxiety-inducing task, let alone having to hold a conversation. “I hate phone calls… because I’m a lot more anxious about things that are uncertain. I like having structure and being as prepared as I can,” she told TODAY over the phone. “Over email or text messages, at least it's in writing and I have time to think about how to reply and what I want to say. When over the phone, there’s so much uncertainty about what could play out. “Even if I do have to make a phone call, I will take a post-it note and write down all the different points I need to cover during my phone call,” Ms Elangovan said. Why put herself through such a hassle when phone calls used to be a simple dial-and-talk affair? The fresh graduate from Nanyang Technological University said she fears coming off as unprepared or confused when taking a call. The post-it notes help settle her nerves, Ms Elangovan said, citing a recent call with a hirer for a potential job as an example. “I had a lot of information about the job but none of it (written down) in black and white,” she said. “So when I was calling them back to clarify details — such as the job interview and pay package — my post-it notes helped me as I was just checking things off… (ensuring) I covered everything.” Ms Elangovan’s case of “phone anxiety” is not uncommon among digital natives who have grown up amid computers and the internet. In Australia, a survey last year of more than 1,000 Gen Zers aged 18 to 26 found that only one in 10 prefer to talk to family and friends via a phone call. About 49 per cent said speaking over the phone made them anxious, while six in 10 dreaded making or accepting a phone call, according to the survey conducted by Australia’s telecommunications company More Telecom in May 2023. Another survey by European telecommunications provider Sky Mobile of 1,000 youths aged 18 to 24 in October 2023 also found that a quarter of them actively ignored phone calls, while more than half, or 57 per cent, admitted to ignoring their parents' phone calls. This texting preference by Gen Z is not a recent phenomenon; their millennial counterparts — those aged between 27 and 42 — have been doing so as early as 2009, sociologists told TODAY. According to a survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre released in 2012, the typical American teen aged 12 to 17 was sending and receiving 60 messages in 2011, up from 50 in 2009. The same survey found that 26 per cent of American teens were calling their friends in 2011 using their handphones, down from 38 per cent in 2009. In Singapore, 12 youths aged 35 and under told TODAY that texting is the main mode of communication for them, even though three of them still prefer calling. While advocates of texting cite convenience of replying anywhere and anytime, and having the time to think of a reply as among the benefits, TODAY’s interviews with those in their 40s and 50s point to a generational split on the issue. “Texting on the computer is fine since the screen is bigger and it's easier to read. But on the phone with the small keyboard, it can be quite difficult,” said Ms Angie Neo, 59, an administrative executive with a real estate firm. “Calling is just more straightforward since you just say what you need and get the message across,” she added. Still, Ms Neo and several older interviewees told TODAY that they are adapting to the change in communicating habits by texting their children and younger colleagues more. Sociologists also pointed out that texting is not all positive as it could possibly impact communication skills due to the lack of certain social cues like a person’s expression and the tone of their voice. With texting likely to remain as the main form of communication for zoomers and millennials in the near future, TODAY looks at the impact it will have on the way people interact with each other both at home and in the workplace. Like many of her generation these days, the first thing Ms Elangovan does when she wakes up is to check her mobile phone for texts sent overnight. Without leaving the comfort of her bed, she scans through each notification or message on her phone apps — Telegram, WhatsApp, Instagram followed by Discord — to see if she has missed anything important. “I don’t always reply immediately unless it's something urgent, perhaps a friend asking for help,” Ms Elangovan said. For 43-year-old Mariasusai Maria Sophia, her two children’s habit of texting before getting out of bed often triggers a lengthy nagging from her on a daily basis. “I always tell them to at least wash up first, get out of bed before continuing whatever you want to do,” said the manager at a construction and engineering firm. Her two children, aged 18 and 20, are often on their phones texting. Even with her, they prefer to text even though Ms Sophia has made it clear that she would rather have a phone call from them. “I really don’t know what is in their mind, (and) why this generation only text and text. They’re just not socialising as much,” she lamented. “Maybe I’m too old school and traditional, but when you talk over the phone, there’s a connection while texting is just monotonous.” Despite her reservations, Ms Sophia and several others in their 40s and 50s told TODAY that they have learnt to adapt to the younger generations’ growing reliance on messaging applications such as WhatsApp. Even as older individuals acknowledge that texting does have its uses, such as having a written message to refer to, the way they text or respond to texting can sometimes raise eyebrows, or even cause frustration, among the younger ones. Receiving images of “good morning” is the norm for Mr Javier Koh, 23, a Singapore Management University (SMU) business undergraduate, as his mother sends different pictures each day. Although he and his two siblings find such images annoying, Mr Koh has accepted it as a “boomer” thing, and tries to see the pictures as an expression of his mother’s love for them. “I always wonder where and how she gets different pictures each day,” he joked. When Mr Koh sends a message to his parents, the way he writes them also differs from the ones he sends to friends. There are fewer vulgarities, emojis, jokes and most importantly — no abbreviations. “If I use one, they’ll ask what it means. Like ‘TTYL’ which stands for ‘talk to you later’,” he said. “It’s more troublesome to explain since these abbreviations are meant to help us type faster. I'd rather just spell it out from the start.” The “blue tick” — a feature on WhatsApp that signals if the receiver has seen a message sent to them — also means different things for recipients of different ages, which can result in some unhappiness. For youths, sending a message and getting a signal through two blue ticks indicates that it has been read by the recipient. Thus, for them, a non-response is a rude sign, indicating that they are being ignored. To avoid unnecessary drama, some opt to turn off the blue-tick function on their messaging apps. Others like Mr Koh just read their notifications but do not click into their messaging app. “Or if I really don’t have time to reply to the message, I’ll at least react with an emoji as a form of acknowledgement because as someone who has been ‘blue tick-ed’ (ignored), it’s not a nice feeling to be left hanging,” Mr Koh said. But for some older text recipients, the blue tick is simply an acknowledgment that the message has been read. “Honestly, there isn’t a need to reply. As long as they see the message, it’s good enough for me,” said Ms Sophia. Mr Edwin Yeo, general manager of public relationship firm SPRG Singapore said that youth's preference for texting can have its downsides. “Youths have a fear of rejection that when they call someone, they might ignore or hang up on them,” he said. “However, calls can be more convenient when brainstorming and making clarifications... without misunderstanding as you can hear their tone of voice, unlike text.” For many young ones, their preference for texting boils down to one word — convenience. One can text while out and about, lazing at home, or even in class. And sending a message to a friend or family member takes mere seconds. But add all those seconds together, and many youths admit that they actually spend hours a day glued to their messaging apps. “You can reply anywhere, anytime. Your phone is with you all the time,” said 23-year-old SMU business undergraduate Loy Ming Hao. Like other youths, he noted that messaging applications also have unique features that make communication more engaging, such as “video bubbles” which allow youths to send short videos of themselves. Even among youngsters who prefer phone calls, texting is still the primary means of communicating. Eighteen-year-old Shayna Choo said she spends roughly two hours weekly calling her boyfriend, but at least eight hours texting her friends during a typical week. “It’s much easier to catch up with them over call, and you feel closer when you hear their voice,” said the second-year business student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP). “But honestly, I text much more than I call (my friends) because my close friends and I have our own lives and it’s hard to find a common time. “It’s also weird to call people I’m not close to like an acquaintance… The conversation might get awkward since there’s not much we can talk about.” Like other youths, Ms Choo’s calls are reserved for close friends and family members. And if she were to call, these are often scheduled unless it is for something she considers urgent. If the call is not scheduled, youths told TODAY that they think twice before picking up. “If it’s a close friend, I would worry about what's going on and pick up the call (assuming) it’s something urgent. If it's someone I’m not close to, I’ll question why before picking up or might text back asking why they are calling,” said Ms Tay Xiu Qin, 18, a second-year banking and finance student at NP. “But if it’s a number I don’t recognise, I assume it’s a scammer and don’t answer at all.” There are also spaces where talking on the phone would be inappropriate, such as on public transport. Mr Koh, the SMU student, pointed out that calling someone would disturb the peace and might elicit stares from other commuters. “If I’m on the train, it's also too noisy sometimes and the other person on the line cannot hear me. I also don’t want to talk about something personal like what I’m doing that day while other passengers can hear and might eavesdrop,” he said. Instead, Mr Koh would hang up and immediately text the person that he is unable to speak over the phone. When it comes to texting friends and family in social settings, the youths told TODAY that there are certain nuances that they are mindful of, too. It’s not just the “blue ticks” but the way they write their messages. Emojis, for one, determine the seriousness of a text. “For example, I’m going through a minor inconvenience so I text my friends ‘OMG this is killing me’ with several crying emojis. My parents might take the message literally if they receive it and worry about me, but my friends know my message is a light-hearted complaint and not me actually dying,” said Mr Koh. For Ms Lee, a 20-year-old university student who declined to give her full name, the way people type out their laughter also signifies different things. “If you say ‘haha’, you’re being passive-aggressive or sarcastic. But if you repeat ‘ha’ more than three times, you genuinely mean it,” she said. Ms Elangovan added that if her friends change the way they type — such as adding a punctuation mark when they usually do not use them, writing in a proper sentence and sending a single long message instead of a series of texts — alarm bells ring in her head. “To me, it signals maybe something isn’t right and they might be upset or are acting passive-aggressive towards me,” she said. “It’s kind of like the tone of someone’s voice when you’re speaking to someone.” Just like with friends and family, youths also rely on text messages when chatting with their colleagues — especially with hybrid work arrangements becoming more common post-pandemic. For 26-year-old Hilman, who declined to share his full name, text messages to fellow colleagues are not as formal as emails, as he uses the occasional emoji. “It’s boring to always respond with a straight ‘noted, thanks’ right? Sometimes I use a thumbs-up emoji and reply with a ‘cool’,” said the engineer. “But when it comes to more complicated things I have to relay to my colleagues, a call is honestly easier because we can just iron things out immediately. So although I prefer texting, it's (a phone call) just more convenient.” While making a call may be more convenient in relaying urgent information at short notice, receiving such a call can be nerve-racking. “After work, if I receive a call from someone above me, I hesitate to answer but have to,” said Mr Lionel Lim, 28, who works in the military. “There’s a fear that I might be getting called back (to work). Or that something has gone wrong.” While such messages would not sound any better in a text, Mr Lim said hearing the phone ring sends shivers down his spine. As for Ms Lee, the university student, having instructions over text not only spares her the anxiety of having to speak to a boss, but also removes any possible misunderstanding that could result from a call. “Once, my boss gave me instructions over the phone, and later scolded me by claiming that he did not give me the instructions,” she recalled of her part-time job at a food-and-beverage outlet. “If it was over text, at least it would have been in black and white.” Even if she may use an emoji or two when communicating with her colleagues and employer, Ms Lee admitted that her texting style is different when it comes to friends. Describing work-related texts as “more formal”, Ms Lee avoids abbreviations and would give her message a second read to fix any grammatical errors before sending it out. For Ms Neo, the administrative executive, her WhatsApp application on her work computer takes up half the screen, rather than her email. “I may be working in the office, but some of my younger colleagues will text me instead of just coming up to my desk and asking me in person,” she said. “I sometimes wonder why they don’t want to walk over even though we aren’t that far away from each other. “But to be honest, texting colleagues isn’t that bad. It’s easier to gossip since you don’t need to watch who might be overhearing you conversation,” she said, laughing. Mr Yeo of SPRG Singapore said that although some of his younger employees are not keen on phone calls, texting can be counter-productive in the workplace. “When we have group chats, sometimes people hesitate to reply and you have to prompt them one by one. But if we have an in-person meeting or one over video-conferencing, people are more open to speak,” said the 56-year-old. “So when it comes to meetings and discussions, calls and in-person meetings are still the way to go.” He has also found himself unintentionally inciting fear in his employees when he drops them a text message, as they often assume he is angry based on his text. “All these social cues are lost like the tone of my voice. But I’m not angry, I’m just asking them something,” Mr Yeo said. Ms Dione Ng, associate manager of Michael Page Singapore, said that the loss of nuance and tone leading to misunderstandings is one downside of texting in the workplace, alongside difficulty in building rapport and trust. However, there are several benefits, such as clearer record of communications, and the ability to focus on the task at hand before responding to messages. It also helps employees working remotely to communicate with one another. As to whether it is appropriate to communicate via text at work, Ms Ng said it depends on the situation. “The best approach is open communication. Letting colleagues know your preferred communication style and being open to theirs. “Not everyone may be comfortable with certain technology, some older workers may miss the more formal communication styles of the past.” Ms Ng added that there is a need to consider how appropriate certain messages, such as video or audio ones, are depending on the company culture or the nature of the message. “Some workplaces have a more casual culture where video messages might be perfectly acceptable. Simple updates could also work in these formats, while complex topics are better suited for emails or video conferencing,” she said. But Ms Ng cautioned that companies adapting to the growing reliance on texting should not be quick to abandon phone calls since the latter can help build rapport among colleagues and with external clients, allow for immediate clarification and conveying urgent messages, among other things. Dr Carol Soon, principal research fellow from the Institute of Policy Studies, said Gen Z's preference for texting is “unsurprising” as several studies have shown that millennials have similar preferences. Texting provides youths with more control over their schedules as they can communicate whenever they want, allows them to multi-task and avoid small talk, she noted. “This reason also accounts for why people from other generations are also veering to texting, with phone calls used for urgent communications or speaking with elderly members in the family,” said Dr Soon. Dr Andrew Yee, an assistant professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, admitted that these are reasons why he prefers texting as well. “In a phone call, it is often more demanding, as we need to pay full attention to the person on the other line and respond immediately. There is likely a lower sense of control over the communication process as we need to respond immediately,” said the sociologist. “When we text, we can carefully craft what we want to convey and take our time to respond. As such, there is a greater sense of control. On various platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, we can even edit and delete our messages.” Such features are especially important for people who are introverted or socially anxious, he added. Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore, noted there are some negatives in texting. For one, youths’ reliance on texting might mean more misunderstandings as they lose social cues such as facial expressions, and possibly missing out on learning and practising social interaction skills. “To me, another negative of only texting is when one misses an emergency call from someone who has no time to write a text, is incapable of texting — such as a senior who is neither literate, nor able to use the text features of the smartphone — or have access to only a landline at home,” he said. Dr Yee added that problems may also arise if conversation partners have different preferences of communication. “For example, if my co-worker prefers speaking on the phone, they may find my texting or emailing very impersonal, which may lead to inefficiencies in communication,” he said. Despite the pitfalls, Dr Yee said he does not view the new forms of communication as problematic. Noting his nine-year-old son communicates with his similarly-aged best friend using their parents' phones solely via GIFs (graphics interchange format), Dr Yee said that there are different ways of communicating with each other, in which both parties “negotiate” and find common ground over time. “As long as the purposes of communication, such as building relationships and conveying meaning, are satisfactorily achieved, I am not sure if we need to worry too much about it,” he said. Dr Soon added: “There are pros and cons with every technology use, but behaviours and norms adapt as we go along.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This week, we look at why youths prefer to text than to get on a phone call, both at work and socially. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Before making a phone call, 26-year-old Nivani Elangovan would prepare herself by mentally mapping out what could happen during the tele-conversation and jotting down pointers on post-it notes for reference. Typing a phone number into her seldom-used call app on her handphone is an anxiety-inducing task, let alone having to hold a conversation. “I hate phone calls… because I’m a lot more anxious about things that are uncertain.

Ms Elangovan’s case of “phone anxiety” is not uncommon among digital natives who have grown up amid computers and the internet. In Australia, a survey last year of more than 1,000 Gen Zers aged 18 to 26 found that only one in 10 prefer to talk to family and friends via a phone call. About 49 per cent said speaking over the phone made them anxious, while six in 10 dreaded making or accepting a phone call, according to the survey conducted by Australia’s telecommunications company More Telecom in May 2023. This texting preference by Gen Z is not a recent phenomenon; their millennial counterparts — those aged between 27 and 42 — have been doing so as early as 2009, sociologists told TODAY. According to a survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre released in 2012, the typical American teen aged 12 to 17 was sending and receiving 60 messages in 2011, up from 50 in 2009. The same survey found that 26 per cent of American teens were calling their friends in 2011 using their handphones, down from 38 per cent in 2009. In Singapore, 12 youths aged 35 and under told TODAY that texting is the main mode of communication for them, even though three of them still prefer calling. TODAY’s interviews with those in their 40s and 50s point to a generational split when it comes to texting and calling. “Texting on the computer is fine since the screen is bigger and it's easier to read.

The way older people text also differs from youths, such as using fewer abbreviations and taking no offence when their messages are \"blue ticked\", or left read but unreplied. For youths, sending a message and getting a signal through two blue ticks indicates that it has been read by the recipient. Thus, for them, a non response is a rude sign, suggesting that they are being ignored. For older text recipients, this is a non-problem as the blue ticks are simply an acknowledgment that the message has been read. Mr Edwin Yeo, 56, general manager of public relationship firm SPRG Singapore, added that youth's preference for texting even at the workplace can have its downsides. \"Calls can be more convenient when brainstorming and making clarifications... without misunderstanding as you can hear their tone of voice, unlike text.” Youths who prefer texting cite convenience of replying anywhere and anytime and having the time to think of a reply as among some of the benefits. They note that messaging applications also have unique features that make communication more engaging, such as “video bubbles” which allow youths to send short videos of themselves. Even among youngsters who prefer phone calls, texting is still the primary means of communicating. Eighteen-year-old Shayna Choo said she spends roughly two hours weekly calling her boyfriend, but at least eight hours texting her friends during a typical week. “It’s much easier to catch up with them over call, and you feel closer when you hear their voice,” said the second-year business student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP). “But honestly, I text much more than I call (my friends) because my close friends and I have our own lives and it’s hard to find a common time.\" Like other youths, Ms Choo’s calls are reserved for close friends and family members. And if she were to call, these are often scheduled unless it is for something she considers urgent. If the call is not scheduled, youths told TODAY that they think twice before picking up. “If it’s a close friend, I would worry about what's going on and pick up the call (assuming) it’s something urgent. If it's someone I’m not close to, I’ll question why before picking up or might text back asking why they are calling,” said Ms Tay Xiu Qin, 18, a second-year banking and finance student at NP. Youths told TODAY there are several nuances when texting that help them derive social cues. This includes how they type, the type of emoji used and the way they express their laughter over text. In the workplace, their text messages are slightly more formal, as they type without abbreviations. They also give their messages a second read to fix any grammatical errors before sending it out. Dr Carol Soon, principal research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, said Gen Zers' preference for texting is “unsurprising” as several studies have shown that millennials have similar preferences. Texting provides youths with more control over their schedules as they can communicate whenever they want, allows them to multi-task and avoid small talk, she noted. “This reason also accounts for why people from other generations are also veering to texting, with phone calls used for urgent communications or speaking with elderly members in the family,” said Dr Soon. Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist at the National University of Singapore, noted there are some negatives in texting. For one thing, youths’ reliance on texting might mean more misunderstandings as they lose social cues such as facial expressions, and possibly missing out on learning and practising social interaction skills. “To me, another negative of only texting is when one misses an emergency call from someone who has no time to write a text, is incapable of texting — such as a senior who is neither literate, nor able to use the text features of the smartphone — or have access to only a landline at home,” he said. Dr Andrew Yee, an assistant professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, added that problems may also arise if conversation partners have different preferences of communication. “For example, if my co-worker prefers speaking on the phone, they may find my texting or emailing very impersonal, which may lead to inefficiencies in communication,” he said. Despite the pitfalls, Dr Yee said he does not view the new forms of communication as problematic. “As long as the purposes of communication, such as building relationships and conveying meaning, are satisfactorily achieved, I am not sure if we need to worry too much about it,” he said.

SINGAPORE — When Mr Syukri Azman first reached out to a chief executive officer (CEO) of a logistics firm over professional networking platform LinkedIn, it was out of curiosity to find out how the company managed to secure a tender from a multinational corporation in Singapore. Little did he know that the top-level executive would accept his cold call, and it would lead to a job offer. As the CEO shared his business journey in a casual meet-up in 2018, Mr Syukri realised that he could fill a “gap” in the company by establishing training practices, given his experience in talent development. A few weeks later, the CEO initiated another meet-up and offered him a full-time position, which he accepted. For Mr Syukri, 30, a sales effectiveness specialist in a global data and analytics company, digital networking platforms have been the gateway to not only unexpected career opportunities, but also a means to build a professional brand. He now has over 7,800 followers on LinkedIn and has been given the title of “Top Voice” that the platform accords to particularly active members and experts in their field. “On LinkedIn, the professionals want people to hear their stories, and it’s easier to get connected with high profile professionals, because usually their profile is not managed by another person as compared to other social media,” he told TODAY. For other more introverted young professionals, the emergence of digital networking is a dream, compared to traditional modes of in-person business card exchanges and etiquette-laden self-introductions. As an introvert who avoids large crowds and describes meeting multiple people a day as “socially draining”, personal wealth manager Cristelle Lim found it easier to build a professional circle online. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, she has taken to networking with other professionals on LinkedIn and meeting clients around her age over Instagram, as her business heavily relies on referrals and a visible online social media presence. “When I first started in financial services, I got my first client from LinkedIn about three months into using the platform. It built my confidence that using social media is actually a way to network, and it is super effective for me until today too,” said Ms Lim, who is in her late 20s and has over 15,000 followers on LinkedIn. “As I engage on LinkedIn from Monday to Friday, more people see my work and how I have helped others before and read my posts and thus are more open to meeting me, a complete stranger, online.” Similarly, Ms Sabrina Ooi, 33, co-founder and CEO of Calm Collective Asia, uses LinkedIn “extensively” to form new connections with human resources leaders and potential speakers for her company’s talks and events. The introvert also shares posts related to mental health, personal reflections and behind the scenes in her job as a workplace mental health and well-being consultant with her 38,000 followers on LinkedIn. Yet even as social media provides new modes of networking, experts and employers say that networking in its traditional face-to-face form remains relevant, given the competitive job market and business conditions in Singapore. Networking is also not just for job-searching, but important too for one’s career progression, which is why physical forms of networking are still well-attended, they add. “Today, while the mode of networking has changed quite fundamentally, the essence and purpose of networking has not changed. Networking is ultimately about establishing relationships,” said Mr Suhaimi Salleh, CEO of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group. “What is more important is not the mode of networking but the outcomes of the network,” he added. Here, TODAY takes a closer look at how the professional networking landscape has evolved as young professionals blend their work and personal lives online, and what one should do to build a network online. Youths in their 20s and 30s from various industries who network actively told TODAY that they prioritise making genuine connections rather than having superficial, transactional relationships. This desire to see an “authentic” self in a professional setting also brings a greater openness to more informal meetings and personal content being posted on professional networking platforms. While she knows of peers whose impression of LinkedIn is marred by superficial posts from people seeking clout or “posting for the sake of posting”, Ms Sherry Jiang, 32, said digital platforms have afforded her a space to connect with a larger audience. She does so through sharing personal, almost journal-like content that can range from discussing personal finance to documenting her startup journey. “Younger professionals are way more casual and informal. No more suits, handshakes and business cards. We want to actually get to know who you are,” said Ms Jiang, who is the co-founder and CEO of Peek, a financial product. “That person has a whole bunch of other qualities to evaluate, which are important when forming business partnerships because you want to know if you actually get along with someone and share common values, and it's hard to do that if it’s just robotically talking about work,” she added. Her most popular LinkedIn posts include: Ms Jiang said that she learnt how to network and build a presence online through writing posts on Twitter — now known as X — which was popular in the cryptocurrency space. “I got really comfortable with sharing things that I thought could be polarising, and people appreciate that, because they would rather you be real and say what you think than try to put out something that feels more edited or diplomatic.” Agreeing, Ms Phoebe Zoe Ho, 29, said that she became more open to networking when she viewed it as “making friends” within the context of work, rather than a “cold and calculated business manoeuvre”. “When I was younger, networking came across as something transactional, and the notion of meeting people with an ulterior motive seemed exploitative,” said Ms Ho, an art director and set designer. Similarly, Mr Matthew Ng, 23, who works in marketing, knows that networking is “very important” in his industry as freelance jobs are mostly secured through referrals from people he has met. Yet the idea of networking “to climb the ladder of success” in more traditional environments like career fairs feels too transactional and formal for him. “I’ve seen other people network and being cutthroat about it, viewing people as dispensable in a way to help them get to what they want and it’s a goodbye after that,” said Mr Ng. “Being in the creative industry, most of the professional relationships are formed organically through friendships. I find it weird to go up to people and solely ask them about work, job prospects, salary ranges.” For Ms Calissa Man, a 24-year-old working in the venture capital industry, building confidence to network and navigate conversations was a skill she had to actively hone. While she initially feared rejection and was not sure if she would be able to meaningfully contribute to her contacts, she has made an effort to reciprocate the advice and guidance she has received from mentors. “It's also about being authentic and generous to the newfound friends, mentors and sponsors you make along the way too. At its core, networking is a two-way street — that's something I strive to bring to every interaction, catch up or coffee chat.” Beyond job referrals, tips on working life from the connections they make helps young professionals navigate complex workplace dynamics and etiquette in the early stages of their careers. For 26-year-old Melissa Sta Maria, who is planning to make a career switch from sales to the media industry, reaching out to people in her target industry has equipped her with resume skills and a better sense of the companies she would like to join. “Through networking, people share the negatives of a job and they are very upfront about their health scares, work life balance, which are things you don't hear about in the interview and through reading Glassdoor reviews.” Agreeing, Ms Gwendolyn Say, a 24-year-old graphic designer, said that the connections she has built from her university days through classes and school projects have given her good advice on how to engage with clients. “A lot of the practical aspects of my job, I did not learn in school at all. It was specifically lacking for my degree, because so many people go into freelance work. “We weren’t taught any structure, like what is the industry rate, how to write an invoice or what you should put in your quotation, things that are genuinely as important as your skills in design,” said Ms Say. These were skills that she built through contacts who offered up-to-date advice on how to price and scope her services as well as to protect herself as a self-employed person and not undercut others in the industry. Employers and human resource experts say networking is arguably more important today for workers given Singapore’s openness to global talent, a competitive business environment and the current economic uncertainties. Ms Faatimah Haleemah Mohammad Ansaari, director of Universal Landscape and Construction, has noticed some younger employees having a fear of networking, especially with more experienced professionals, as they may feel like they may not be able to “catch up” during conversations due to their inexperience. Yet networking is crucial given the nature of the landscaping sector. “Most of the companies here are older companies, so they have the older mindset where the work is given to people who you have a good relationship with,” said Ms Faatimah. Mr Russell Chin, founder and managing director of interior design company Inspire ID Group, said that the industry has become “way more competitive” and will continue to be so, with around 4,000 to 5,000 interior design companies in Singapore. With home renovations typically costing S$30,000 to S$60,000, Mr Chin said the “human touch” and a rapport between his employees and their contacts is essential, as homeowners will pick those they trust for such “big ticket” purchases. For his younger employees who are hesitant to build contacts, he exposes them to networking opportunities by taking them along to his own meetings. He hosts internal networking sessions for his team to meet with suppliers, clients and collaborating brands, as well as interior design carnivals which allow his employees to network with homeowners directly. Consciously building a social media presence featuring one’s work is also crucial, added Mr Chin, who recalled one of his designers landing a sales lead from a homeowner who saw a TikTok video featuring a house he had designed on his personal account. “If you are not tech savvy and social media savvy, you will lose out, so the impetus to take the initiative is definitely there,” said Mr Chin. Ms Tuyen Do, a principal career coach at The Happy Mondays Co, noted that a personal referral from one’s network can differentiate a candidate in a “sea of digital profiles”, given the “increasingly global and competitive” job market. “For the employers, leveraging networks and referrals can streamline the hiring process, reduce costs, and provide them access to a pool of passive candidates who might not actively seek new opportunities but are open to them when presented by trusted contacts,” said Ms Do. More than career advancement alone, a well-connected network can help professionals stay up to date with critical insights about industry shifts, technological innovations and evolving best practices. “Professional networking is about finding the right mix of authenticity and strategic thinking. It's essentially about creating a network of contacts — your own ‘black book’ — who you can turn to for advice, inspiration, learning opportunities or introductions,” said Ms Do. While people traditionally network through physical engagements with limited prior information and poorer quantity of connections established within a single session, digital networking platforms mean professionals today can establish their network with a click of a button. Networking practices like exchanging business cards have fallen out of fashion with younger professionals, who may think of it as “cumbersome” or “environmentally unfriendly”, said Ms Jessly Chew, associate director at recruitment agency Michael Page Singapore. “The online platform is a good way for professionals to discover the different types of communities available, preview the types of content or activity available and identify mutual connections with existing members. “This allows people to be more informed about the network that they are approaching and whether it’s relevant for them,” said Ms Chew. Being digital natives, young professionals are “much more comfortable” networking online and foster connections quickly with people around the globe, said Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of permanent recruitment in Asia Pacific at executive search firm Randstad. LinkedIn is the world's “largest professional network” with over 1 billion members globally, including over three million users in Singapore. Ms Pooja Chhabria, a career expert from LinkedIn, said that its consumer research has shown young professionals to be the group devoting the “most time” to developing networking skills, with many indicating that they spend 30 minutes to two hours a month on honing the skill. A 2023 study by LinkedIn showed that the proportion of Gen Z professionals between the ages of 18 and 24 on its platform in Singapore has grown from 2.4 per cent in 2013 to 23.5 per cent in 2023. One “major shift” in networking is the confluence of online profiles and in-person networking as online platforms like LinkedIn gain credibility, said Ang Yuit, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (ASME). “These days, people do Google you or check out your LinkedIn as a precursor to approaching you in person. Prospects and new contacts often check you out in quite some detail before and after meeting you before deciding how they should continue to engage with you,” said Mr Ang. Agreeing, Ms Do said young professionals should view their entire online presence as part of their digital networking strategy. She pointed to a 2018 survey by employment site CareerBuilder which found that 70 per cent of employers screen potential candidates on social media, and 54 per cent have decided against hiring someone based on what they discovered. “The rise of social media has made networking more accessible and scalable, albeit with unique challenges,” said Mr Kenji Naito, CEO of recruitment firm Reeracoen Group. Some of these challenges include information overload, with a vast amount of content and connections to sift through to identify meaningful networking opportunities, and difficulty maintaining sustained engagement over time as online interactions tend to be more fleeting. “Young professionals often prioritise online networking due to its convenience and reach. However, there's a growing awareness of the need for authentic connections and meaningful interactions,” he added. Mr Syukri, the sales effectiveness specialist who is a “Top Voice” on LinkedIn, said those who want to successfully connect with an online audience have to “play around a little bit” and share their personality beyond their day job on their professional networking platforms. Not only does he make it a priority to make new connections on LinkedIn and comment on posts that resonate with him, he also regularly posts commentary about current affairs, even on more “sensitive” subjects like religion and politics, as that reflects his values and helps him stand out in the “noisy world” of online networking. He recalled viewing an individual’s “heartfelt” story about saving enough money from his paycheck to buy his first bed frame which attracted a lot of views on LinkedIn. While being vulnerable and sharing one’s personal life in a professional setting can seem daunting at first, Mr Syukri said being open to posting such content can be the key to building connections because others may relate to similar struggles. Ms Pooja from LinkedIn also emphasised that building a network on the platform is not a “numbers game”, as having a large number of connections may not necessarily give one an “edge” over other professionals. “If you are considering connecting to someone you don’t actually know, you might actually consider following them instead. When you follow someone, you will still see any posts they share,” she said. She advised professionals on its platform to consider connecting with people they have “trusted relationships” with, such as co-workers, alumni, and business partners and following global industry leaders to see their posts on one’s feed for educational content. “Having the right network will improve the quality and relevance of your feed, the people who send you messages, and who engages with your content. Remember, you and your network are on a professional journey together, and the stronger your network, the further you can go.” Ms Do the career coach added: “It’s essential to focus on the quality of your connections rather than merely increasing your follower count. “More followers on LinkedIn don't automatically equate to more meaningful relationships. Thoughtful engagement is essential to transform these digital ‘names’ into ‘real connections’ with potential.” Experts cautioned that online networking, with its far reach and ease of facilitating connections at a large scale, should not be seen as a complete replacement for offline interactions, which still offers nuanced and potentially deeper connections. “The internet has made professional networking much more dynamic and accessible than before, allowing professionals to transcend geographical limits and foster instant connections with others,” said Ms Dass of Randstad. “However, messages may lack subtle social cues and genuinity, reinforcing the importance of human connection.” Mr Ang from ASME added that most people still prefer meeting up in person, as body language helps to enable the conversations to flow more easily, and the relationships to grow. “So, these ‘traditional’ modes of networking are here to stay. Digital platforms and social media have added layers to, but not replaced these so-called traditional networking modes.” Certain sectors like law and finance may also emphasise formal networking events, while informal meetups or social media usage to connect may be more prevalent in the technology and creative fields, added Ms Do. Being in the venture capital industry, Mr John Tay, a 34-year-old head of partnerships at Tin Men Capital, needs to meet people in the startup ecosystem on a daily basis. “It is more important than ever to have an online presence. In Asian culture, it’s often frowned upon to stand out or be vocal. But in a sea of noise and signals, out of sight, out of mind. “You have to show up at events, and post content online consistently. Once you get the hang of this, you’ll realise that more people reach out to you.” Mr Tay said that he prefers to conduct a “hybrid” of digital and physical networking, with about 80 per cent of his networking conducted in person. He meets at least three new stakeholders every week, through follow-ups from networking events, introductions from trusted contacts or from cold calls over LinkedIn, which he uses daily. This year, he co-founded a Startup Walking Tour with a friend, to bring foreign guests on a walking tour through a typical Singapore neighbourhood, while providing an “insider’s look” at Singapore’s tech ecosystem. Through the three-hour tour, he plans to give visitors a “solid download of local culture” and enable connections with local organisations which can facilitate business and investments through Singapore’s startups. With the rise of more flexible work arrangements, co-working spaces that mix private offices and communal areas also facilitate networking between solo entrepreneurs as well as employees of small- and medium-sized enterprises and local offices for multinational corporations. Co-working company JustCo told TODAY it has seen good attendance at its weekly members’ events. In JustCo's Singapore centres, they have held over 270 events in 2023 and 90 events so far this year. “In the past, the more common type of networking event would likely have been organised by business chambers or agencies representing specific industries. At such events, professionals typically met people from similar backgrounds, and foster industry-specific collaborations,” said Ms Shirlene Sim, vice-president and head of JustCo Singapore. “However, the rise of coworking has provided a platform for people from all walks of life and sectors to come together and work efficiently in a shared workspace.” One outlier in the trend towards digital - first networking is Friendzone, a social organisation that runs community-centric events to foster peer support networks in various communities in Singapore. Since 2018, Friendzone has organised 250 gatherings which mainly attracts young professionals between the ages of 25 and 35. It also organises “Out of Office”, a networking series that caters to young professionals from various industries including technology and the social sectors, which attracts around 40 attendees per event on average. Mr Tham Jun Han, co-founder of Friendzone, said: “We have observed that many young professionals often feel lost and isolated as they navigate the complex dynamics of workplace etiquette and politics. “It's challenging for them to discuss these issues with colleagues who may be at different stages in their lives, particularly those who are more established in their careers.” While acknowledging that digital platforms and remote work have changed the landscape of professional networking, he believes that in-person engagement remains “irreplaceable” in building lasting relationships. “While digital tools offer convenience and broad reach, they sometimes lack the depth of connection that face-to-face interactions can foster. There's an element of personal connection, such as non-verbal cues and spontaneous conversations, that only occurs in physical settings,” said Mr Tham. To pair the strengths of its events with digital networking, Friendzone encourages participants to form their own chat groups post-event, and adds participants to industry-specific Telegram groups. With experts expecting the future of networking to involve a further integration of digital tools, what can young professionals do to stand out in a crowded online space?

SINGAPORE — When Mr Syukri Azman first reached out to a chief executive officer (CEO) of a logistics firm over professional networking platform LinkedIn, it was out of curiosity to find out how the company managed to secure a tender from a multinational corporation in Singapore.

Experts such as Ms Pooja from LinkedIn add that professional networking is not a numbers game, as having a large number of connections may not necessarily give one an edge over other professionals. “If you are considering connecting to someone you don’t actually know, you might actually consider following them instead. When you follow someone, you will still see any posts they share,” she said. She advised professionals on its platform to consider connecting with people they have “trusted relationships” with, such as co-workers, alumni, and business partners and following global industry leaders to see their posts on one’s feed for educational content. “Having the right network will improve the quality and relevance of your feed, the people who send you messages, and who engages with your content. Remember, you and your network are on a professional journey together, and the stronger your network, the further you can go.” Ms Do the career coach added: “It’s essential to focus on the quality of your connections rather than merely increasing your follower count. “More followers on LinkedIn don't automatically equate to more meaningful relationships. Thoughtful engagement is essential to transform these digital ‘names’ into ‘real connections’ with potential.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Before she leaves home, Ms Cha Yoo Kyung, 27, always makes sure she has three essential items with her: A food container, cutlery and a reusable shopping bag. By and large, public attitudes towards using less single-use disposables have not changed much, say businesses, environmentalists and consumers. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Before she leaves home, Ms Cha Yoo Kyung, 27, always makes sure she has three essential items with her: A food container, cutlery and a reusable shopping bag. She uses them to pack her lunch every day from coffee shops and hawker centres near her office, as part of a conscious effort to cut down on single-use plastic waste. “I’ve cultivated this habit for about five years now, and it’s mainly thanks to my mum. She takes active steps to minimise unnecessary use of plastic, and she’s been carrying an eco bag to get groceries for as long as I can remember,” said the Singapore permanent resident, who works as a writer. Asked if it was difficult to change her behaviour or to maintain it, Ms Cha said no. “It’s like trying to drink more water throughout the day. You just have to remind yourself and translate that thought into action constantly,” she said. “And if you forget easily, leave your container and utensils in the office instead of taking them home. Set a reminder to bring your container out during lunch, or have a colleague who asks you, ‘Eh, where’s your container?’ This helps a lot.” Ms Cha is part of a growing minority of people here who strive to do more for the environment by reducing the use of plastics and single-use disposables in their everyday lives. Hawker centres, as ubiquitous as they are here, have also taken baby steps to become greener. When Bukit Canberra Hawker Centre opened in December 2022, it made the news for its aim to be one of the greenest hawker centres in Singapore. Among other things, its 44 stalls do not use disposable cutlery for dining in. For takeaways, they use only biodegradable containers or paper bags and boxes, instead of plastic ones. Still, some diners quickly complained about having to fork out S$0.80 for biodegradable containers, underlying the challenge of getting more Singaporeans to embrace sustainability. That reportedly prompted the operator to then stipulate that stall owners are to charge no more than S$0.30 for these containers. This practice is still in place, hawkers there told TODAY this week. However, this also means that some hawkers have to subsidise the cost of the containers, as they said their actual cost is at least S$0.50 per container. Similar consumer complaints surfaced earlier this month — over homegrown bakery brand BreadTalk’s implementation of a S$0.10 charge per disposable plastic carrier bag as well as a S$0.50 charge for a woven carrier bag by American footwear store Skechers. While some consumers support such moves to cut waste, others question if these practices are actually “greenwashing” and aimed at helping retailers increase their profits. Greenwashing is when a business misleads consumers that their products or practices have greater environmental benefits than is the case. Meanwhile, businesses — from bubble tea shops to hawkers, bakeries and mini marts — as well as environmental advocacy groups and consumers themselves also tell TODAY that green habits such as those adopted by Ms Cha are still the exception rather than the norm. Convenience is an often cited reason, with consumers saying it is too “troublesome” to bring their own bags or containers. As Singapore takes baby steps towards cutting down single-use disposables and plastic waste, TODAY takes a deeper look at how Singapore has fared, why public attitudes have largely not changed and what more can be done to nudge more consumers to go green. Plastic is the fourth highest type of waste generated in Singapore, with one million tonnes of plastic waste generated in 2022, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA). This translates to 177kg of plastic waste per capita in 2022, a 17 per cent increase from the 145kg per capita in 2017. Only 6 per cent of plastic waste is recycled. The remaining 944,000 tonnes, comprising single-use and reusable plastics, are disposed of. NEA’s website also states that in 2020, about 200,000 tonnes of domestic waste were single-use disposables, comprising both packaging and non-packaging items such as carrier bags, food and beverage containers, as well as tableware and utensils. Singapore is also one of the world’s greatest consumers of single-use plastics, with a per capita use of 76kg in 2019, according to global data gathering platform Statista. This was also the biggest volume in the Asia-Pacific region. NEA said on its website that with Singapore’s only landfill, Semakau Landfill, projected to be fully filled by 2035 based on current rate of waste generation, reducing the use of single-use disposable items will help cut waste generation. In recent years, both the authorities and environmental groups have launched various initiatives to nudge people to cut down on single-use plastics and disposables. These initiatives include: The various moves have moved the needle in changing consumer behaviour in some aspects. In January this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said the number of plastic bags used at large supermarkets had dropped by 50 to 80 per cent since the mandatory minimum charge of five cents kicked in. In response to TODAY's queries, a BreadTalk Group spokesperson said its S$0.10 charge for plastic bags implemented on April 1 has reduced such usage across its BreadTalk stores by 65 per cent. “We have also observed a notable increase in customers bringing their own bags to the store when purchasing our products,” she said. “To encourage greater adoption of this initiative, we provide customers with the option to have their bun purchases taped up upon request, thus facilitating easy placement into their reusable bags.” For a retiree who wanted to be known only as Mrs Nathan, the shift towards eco-living started three years ago. Carrying a reusable bag at a FairPrice supermarket, the 65-year-old told TODAY that her children persuaded her to stop using plastic bags to “save the animals”. As an avid news reader who has read about the effects of climate change, she added that the switch was easy for her. “If we don’t start (practising green habits), then our children and grandchildren won’t start. So we have to start somewhere.” Mrs Nathan also said she rarely eats out, but when she does so with her family, she brings tiffin carriers in case there is unfinished food. Another eco-conscious individual, social media executive Clara Quek, 25, said she would also bring her own bag, cup, and container when she goes out. “I started doing it during my internship two years ago as we always bought food back to the office to eat, and most of my colleagues brought containers.” Ms Quek said that initially, washing and drying the containers after eating felt troublesome, but she soon adapted to it. “My motivation was to save on money paid for the plastic containers or cups, as I can save about S$1 on these disposables daily. If I ever forget to bring my container, I’ll choose to eat out instead,” she said. Although more shoppers in supermarkets appear to have swapped single-use plastic bags for their own reusable carriers, hawkers and other retailers told TODAY they have seen little change in consumer behaviour. On a weekly basis, they encounter only a handful of customers who bring their own containers or bags, compared to hundreds who do not. Mr Melvin Chew, 46, who runs Jin Ji Teochew Braised Duck hawker stall in Chinatown, said that consumers have come to accept that charges for plastic takeaway containers, as long as they are reasonable, are the norm. “When we started implementing takeaway charges of S$0.20 in the late 90s, there were many complaints. People thought hawkers should absorb the container cost. “But now, they’re probably used to it, unless you use something different like biodegradable packaging and charge S$0.50, maybe the complaints will come again,” he said. As with most hawkers, Mr Chew currently uses plastic containers for takeaways. He said he considered more eco-friendly alternatives such as biodegradable ones, but they cost twice as much. Mr Chew explained that he does not profit from his charges for plastic containers. In fact, he is making a slight loss as he is charging S$0.30 for large containers, even though they cost him about S$0.40 each. He charges S$0.20 for small containers, which is his cost price. Ms Doreen Winata, a franchisee of Shi Nian Pig Leg Rice in Kovan, said the rise in Goods and Services Tax (GST) to 9 per cent this year prompted her to start charging S$0.30 for takeaway containers. The 27-year-old said that she initially absorbed this packing cost, but the GST hike made it difficult for her to sustain the business. After implementing the charge, she also switched to biodegradable containers to better justify the increase in price to her customers. “I actually hoped the S$0.30 charge would also make more people think about bringing containers, but I guess they are used to it because almost every stall charges for takeaway now.” Over at Hussain Muslim Food, also in Kovan, hawker Siti Leonita Minhad, 37, explained that it is tough for hawkers to cut down on the amount of plastic bags used because sometimes, they will need to pack different food separately to prevent spillage. “We also usually double-wrap hot food in plastic bags to ensure that it is safe until the customer reaches home.” Customers who bring their own bags and cups to bubble tea stalls and bakeries are also few and far between, according to operators that TODAY spoke to. Those working at several bubble tea stalls, including Chi Cha San Chen, LiHo, and The Alley, said while they welcome customers who bring their own cups, they normally see such individuals less than five times a week. The situation is also similar at food outlets such as Old Chang Kee, Dough Culture, and Jian Bo Shui Kueh, as well as bakeries nestled in public housing blocks. Ms Chin Mei Lee, 60, a supervisor of an Old Chang Kee outlet in Bishan, said she has seen a slight uptick in customers who decline plastic bags when their food is being packed after the Government announced the minimum five-cent charge for plastic carriers in supermarkets last year, even though Old Chang Kee does not have such a charge. “Those who buy one or two snacks will tell us they don’t need a plastic bag, but there are only one or two such customers in a day,” she said. Likewise, Ms Widya Pujilestari, 43, who works at a bakery in Bishan, cited the same frequency of seeing only one to two customers a day declining plastic bags or asking for separate items to be packed together. “Generally, it would be difficult for bakeries like ours to reduce their use of plastics as we need to separate food with different taste profiles. We have sweet and savoury puffs, and we don’t pack them together unless the customer tells us it’s okay,” she added. Environmentalists say that given Singaporeans' busy lifestyle and preference for convenience, getting people to consciously adopt green habits remains a work in progress. “Most people in Singapore, both consumers and businesses, are driven by dollars and cents — what is the cheapest and most convenient — and rarely by altruistic reasons,” said Ms Lin Qinghui, founder of D2L.sg, a one-stop food surplus and waste manager. “The culture here is to throw things away. It’s all about convenience, and it’s hard to change this because it’s ingrained in Singaporean society.” Mr Rayson Lim, 27, who is unemployed, said he did try to pick up the habit of bringing his own container out for four to five months in 2022. Eventually, he stopped because he gave in to his laziness in washing the container after eating. Civil servant Shafiq Ahmad, 29, echoed Mr Lim’s sentiments. “I haven’t tried bringing my own container before, but just the thought of doing the washing after eating makes me feel it’s tiring and troublesome.” Ms Tan Huileng, executive director of Zero Waste SG, said that the best way for consumers to change their habits, such as bringing their own containers, is to make it easy to include them in their daily routine. “Place them where they can be obviously seen so you can easily grab them and go,” she said. “Lastly, put some of these items in accessible areas in your journey, such as your car or office, so even if you forget to bring them from home, you still have access to your own container along the way.” Amid the push to use less disposable plastic in everyday life, some companies have jumped on the bandwagon through moves such as charging for plastic bags and switching from conventional plastic bags or packaging to those using biodegradable plastic or paper and other non-plastic materials. However, there has also been debate on whether some of these practices constitute greenwashing. For example, consumers have taken to online forums to discuss how one health and beauty retailer has started charging for plastic bags but still uses plenty of plastic for its house-brand water products. Another discussion involved a food court chain that removed plastic straws but introduced cups with plastic caps for cold drinks, which sell for at least S$2. A consumer pointed out that cold drinks cost about S$1.40 a cup before the change. Some questioned whether the amount of plastic used for the cap is less than that of a straw, and whether this is just a gimmick to increase profit. Others asked if paper or cloth alternatives for disposable plastics used by some retailers are actually more environmentally friendly. Ms Lin, the environmentalist, cautioned against advocating for non-plastic alternatives without considering Singapore’s “unique” waste management system. She said that in Singapore, where all trash goes to the incinerator, plastics are efficiently incinerated, potentially reducing their harmful effects compared with countries relying on landfills. Conversely, some other materials used to replace plastic come at a higher environmental cost as they might not burn as efficiently or as cleanly as plastic. “Plastic is not environmentally friendly, but if you look at the life cycle analysis across these materials, it’s the lesser evil because the alternatives, like woven cloth, fabric, cardboard, and paper, could actually bring more harm by leaving a larger carbon footprint,\" said Ms Lin. A life cycle assessment is a comprehensive method used to evaluate the environmental impacts of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle. It considers various environmental factors, such as energy consumption, resource depletion, emissions to air, water, and soil, and waste generation at each stage of the product's life. Similarly, Mr Yasser Amin, who heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation addressing urban waste management issues worldwide, said terms such as “biodegradable” or “compostable” often confuse the average person. “It's like a marketing tactic,” said Mr Yasser. He cited how some coffee and cafe chains switched from plastic to compostable straws, when these may not be the more environmentally friendly option. “Companies should be more aware and capable of conducting life cycle assessments to determine the true environmental impact of their alternatives. People need to question company claims more thoroughly.” On NEA's website, in explaining why Singapore does not ban single-use plastics, the agency says that doing so may lead to a switch to disposables made from other materials such as paper or degradable plastics, “which also create waste, have their own set of environmental impacts and are not necessarily better for the environment”. “In view of the above, instead of advocating a switch to degradable materials, Singapore’s approach is to reduce the use of disposables regardless of material type, and promote the use of reusables.” A spokesperson for Starbucks, which is one of the cafe chains in Singapore using compostable straws, said in response to TODAY's queries that the company “strives to ensure sustainability and eco-friendliness across every touch point, taking proactive steps whenever feasible”. \"Our compostable straws are made from corn starch. In our efforts to eliminate plastic straws and reduce our environmental footprint, our cups and strawless lids are made of 100% recycled PET. This directly impacts the reduction in the usage of virgin PET in our ecosystem, reducing the overall carbon footprint,\" she said. PET stands for polyethylene terephthalate, a type of lightweight recyclable plastic commonly used to make beverage bottles and food packaging. The spokesperson also listed various green initiatives by Starbucks Singapore, including a Borrow-A-Cup programme to encourage reuse, Bring Your Own Tumbler discounts, and a transition to eco-friendly materials for all packaging. A Skechers spokesperson said in response to TODAY's queries that it replaced plastic bags in 2019 with non-woven bags, which are resistant to tearing or fraying and are a more sustainable alternative to traditional woven fabrics. As these bags can be used multiple times, they reduce the need for disposable plastic bags, “which, in turn, helps to reduce carbon footprint”, the spokesman added. “While we understand the concerns raised by environmentalists regarding alternative materials, we want to emphasise that… (we are) constantly evaluating and improving our processes to minimise our carbon footprint. “Our use of materials undergoes rigorous scrutiny to ensure we make meaningful strides towards a more sustainable future. We acknowledge the complexities involved and remain dedicated to transparent communication about our efforts,” she said. At BreadTalk, customers who do not want to pay S$0.10 for a plastic bag have the option of buying a S$4 reusable bag made of polyester. “This material is known for its durability and water resistant qualities making it easy to wash if needed,” said the BreadTalk Group spokesman. The BreadTalk Group, which also owns the cafe chain Toast Box, is also in the process of phasing out straws and switching to strawless lids at all Toast Box outlets, with a target to complete this transition by June. Other businesses that adopt and market their eco-friendly initiatives speak of similar challenges. Ms Vanessa Kenchington, chief executive officer and founder of Plain Vanilla Bakery, said she and her team “openly admit” that they have had difficulties implementing plans to further their sustainability goals. The bakery, which has several outlets across the island, ties boxes of cupcakes with twine to reduce the use of paper bags. Reusable paper bags are sold for S$0.50 each to those who need them. Ms Kenchington said that while the company aims to be environmentally conscious and is committed to using more natural materials, balancing sustainability goals with the practicalities of running a viable business has been a constant challenge. \"When we looked into the possibility of composting our packaging independently, we realised there were not many packaging options that would meet the compostable requirement. It was hard to ensure the authenticity of suppliers claiming to offer compostable materials, which meant our packaging options would be very limited,” she said. “We accept that there are limitations to this for a business of our size when we try to be as sustainable as possible, and there is only so much we can do.” Ms Germaine Lye, co-founder of sustainable fashion brand Our Barehands, said that it, too, is constantly balancing its priorities and has adopted a long-term approach to gradually work towards choosing sustainable practices as the business grows. “Currently, what guides our decision-making process is to choose the better alternative and one that does not undermine our objectives, to the best of our knowledge. “For example, we've chosen to use 100 per cent linen fabric over synthetic ones from day one. We’ve also requested transparency in the fabric production process. It's a learning process for everyone, including us,” she said. Our Barehands uses reusable cotton drawstring bags, which it provides free. In response to TODAY’s queries on legislation or guidelines to tackle greenwashing, a spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said that it is currently developing a guide to provide greater clarity to businesses on sustainability claims. “In recent years, CCCS has observed an increased interest from the public in environmental sustainability issues, and we have also noticed that more suppliers are making claims on the environmental impact of their products,” said the spokesperson. “Although CCCS has not received many complaints… CCCS sees the need to provide greater clarity to suppliers on the environmental claims that could amount to an unfair trade practice under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.” CCCS will share more details in due course, the spokesperson added. In 2021, five government ministries released the Singapore Green Plan 2030 , with ambitious targets to make Singapore more environmentally sustainable over the next decade. Some of these targets include reducing the amount of waste sent to the landfill by 20 per cent by 2026, and by 30 per cent by 2030. One may question that the impact that Singapore, a small country with a population of over five million, can make in the grand scheme of things. But experts such as Mr Tomas Louda, chief executive officer and co-founder of ETW, an international recycling company striving to eradicate single-use plastics, said that despite its small size, Singapore can make meaningful contributions to global environmental sustainability by leveraging its strengths in innovation and technology-driven solutions. However, Mr Louda said several challenges exist, such as limited public awareness about the consequences of plastic use and the difficulty of encouraging behavioural change. Furthermore, Singapore's infrastructure and waste management systems may not be fully prepared yet to handle the transition away from plastic. This would then lead to logistical challenges in recycling and waste disposal. “Industries reliant on plastic packaging also struggle to find sustainable alternatives without compromising product safety and quality, while the absence of stringent regulations or incentives further impedes progress,” he said. “Addressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, including education and awareness campaigns to inform the public, investment in innovation for sustainable alternatives and recycling technologies, implementation of effective policies, and infrastructure development to support the transition towards a plastic-free future.” Mr Jonathan Tostevin, chief executive officer of reusable takeaway container rental services Muuse, said that the authorities could improve infrastructure to boost public adoption of reusables. “On the policy side, we could test out what happens if we made reuse the default in defined areas like all tourist spots or Sentosa.\" Mr Yasser of Stridy added that as the hawker culture is unique to Singapore and some other Southeast Asian countries, it would be challenging to look to different places like Europe and implement their policies here. Such policies include a ban on the most common single-use plastic items, such as cutlery, stirrers and straws. “If we banned plastics in Singapore, we would have a riot. So whenever the Government introduces policies or laws, they have to take into consideration the whole of Singapore and how people would react,” he said. “And the hard truth is that only a small portion of Singaporeans care about sustainability.” Hence, Mr Yasser said the authorities should also help make adopting reusables less burdensome on stakeholders and consumers. “For example, I believe the stallholders in food courts and hawker centres have to pay for washing fees. Why would they want to pay the monthly washing fees when buying styrofoam packets in the hundreds cost less? “So how can we look at doing away with washing fees or implementing new infrastructure changes, like building washing facilities in hawkers centres that don't have them?” Mr Yasser added that, ultimately, Singapore is a country built on convenience, and achieving sustainability will take time. “That’s why it’s very, very, very hard for us to shift. But it has to start with ourselves, as individuals, and how the difference we make will affect others because I know the ripple effect works,” he said. “I have been in the ripple effect. Someone organised that beach cleanup I first went to, and because of that, I'm here today. So I do my best. And if every one does their best, we're going to make a huge difference.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Before she leaves home, Ms Cha Yoo Kyung, 27, always makes sure she has three essential items with her: A food container, cutlery and a reusable shopping bag.

On NEA's website, in explaining why Singapore does not ban single-use plastics, the agency said that doing so may lead to a switch to disposables made from other materials such as paper or degradable plastics, “which also create waste, have their own set of environmental impacts and are not necessarily better for the environment”. “In view of the above, instead of advocating a switch to degradable materials, Singapore’s approach is to reduce the use of disposables regardless of material type, and promote the use of reusables.” Similarly, Mr Yasser Amin, who heads Stridy, a non-profit organisation addressing urban waste management issues worldwide, said terms such as “biodegradable” or “compostable” often confuse the average person. “It's like a marketing tactic,” said Mr Yasser. He cited how some coffee and cafe chains switched from plastic to compostable straws, when these may not be the more environmentally friendly option. “Companies should be more aware and capable of conducting life cycle assessments to determine the true environmental impact of their alternatives. People need to question company claims more thoroughly.” In response to TODAY’s queries on legislation or guidelines to tackle greenwashing, a spokesperson for the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore said that it is currently developing a guide to provide greater clarity to businesses on sustainability claims. It will share more details in due course, the spokesperson added. Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Ms Reena Deen didn’t know it then, but despite her enjoying her first stint in the workplace as a fresh grad, her dyslexia made it extremely difficult for her to read Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at how far Singapore has come in boosting employment for persons with disabilities. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Ms Reena Deen didn’t know it then, but despite her enjoying her first stint in the workplace as a fresh graduate, her dyslexia made it extremely difficult for her to read Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Dyslexia is a learning disability that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. For Ms Reena, 41, the information on the rows appeared jumbled. While she had a good relationship with her colleagues and manager, she didn’t feel comfortable enough to share her problems or struggles with them for fear that she might lose her job. “The only thing we learned how to do over the years is we don't really tell people that we have this issue (disability) because if you do that, you’re instantly going to be stigmatised,” said the freelance tuition teacher and indie filmmaker. When it comes to speaking about disabilities, especially invisible ones like hers, Ms Reena has noticed a marked difference in attitudes over the years since she started working. For one, she feels safe enough in her current tuition centre — her workplace for the past three years — to speak openly about her dyslexia, thanks to her manager. Ms Reena’s manager had shared that her son had Asperger’s Syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and she was getting him help. This gave Ms Reena the confidence to be more upfront about her condition, even with her young charges. “This is the first time in a tuition centre that I can openly share with my students about my dyslexia,” she said. “I think, in a way, things are changing. But then again, I know my experience (of being open about her dyslexia with her manager) is an exception, not the norm.” The attitudes surrounding disability at workplaces have continued to change in recent years and this is evident from Mr Ian Tang’s experience. The 42-year-old suffered a stroke in 2018 which affected the left side of his body. While he has regained some mobility, walking around is very tiring for Mr Tang, as his right side does most of the work. He now works in marketing at the National Trades Union Congress and speaks of how his managers and colleagues have been supportive. In one instance, his human resource department helped Mr Tang plot his route from his home to his office to ensure it was sheltered. He also remembered how accommodating and proactive his manager was in asking him if he needed a bigger desk or if he wanted to work closer to the door. “Lifts and ramps are good, but they are not enough,” said Mr Tang. He added that if an employer wants to hire a person with disabilities, everyone from managers to employees has to support this person as part of the company’s culture. Indeed, persons with disabilities and advocates for them told TODAY that Singapore has made good progress in fostering a more inclusive workplace environment and boosting employment opportunities for disabled individuals. Resident employment rate for persons with disabilities aged 15 to 64 has increased from 28.2 per cent in the period of 2018-2019 when such data was first collected, to 30.1 per cent in 2020-2021 and to 31.4 per cent in 2021-2022. To continue pushing for a more inclusive Singapore, the Enabling Masterplan 2030, announced in 2022, outlines a roadmap of 29 recommendations to support people with disabilities. The recommendations include a target of 40 per cent of people with disabilities to be employed by 2030. While some disability advocates TODAY spoke to said that this goal is both “ambitious” and “achievable”, they said that more needs to be done to increase employers' and businesses' awareness of disability to better integrate disabled individuals into the working world. For example, the 40 per cent employment rate needs to be further unpacked to determine what constitutes being “gainfully employed”. “The challenges we face as persons with disabilities are to be given real jobs and not created jobs,” said Ms Cassandra Chiu, president of the Disabled People’s Association. Beyond increasing the employment rate, advocates highlighted other challenges, such as career progression and mobility for persons with disabilities. While there is still room for improvement, disability organisations and advocates agreed that Singapore has made strides in levelling the playing field for persons with disabilities at the workplace. Ms Chiu cited government schemes such as the Enabling Employment Credit and the Open Door Programme that support employers in hiring persons with disabilities as a factor. The Enabling Employment Credit offsets up to 20 per cent of wages and is capped at S$400 per month for each employee. The Open Door Programme encourages employers to hire, train and integrate persons with disabilities through recruitment, job placement and job support services. In 2022, close to 6,600 organisations received the EEC and collectively employed more than 10,000 employees with disabilities, the Ministry of Social and Family Development said in a parliamentary reply in October 2023. “If we look at the last 20 years or so in terms of employment of persons with disabilities, I think there are a lot more schemes currently,” said Ms Chiu, who is blind. Ms Chiu remembers graduating with a Masters in Counselling in 2011 and how difficult it was to get a job as a school counsellor in public schools. When she finally got a job with a private firm counselling inmates at Changi Prison, she discovered that her salary was half that of her peers, at S$1,800 before Central Provident Fund deductions. She was also not provided with a laptop equipped with accessibility software to do her work, so Ms Chiu had to bring her own to the workplace. “I wasn't able to do my job because there were attitudes or mindsets that a blind person could not do the job because it was dangerous or whatever the reason,” she said. Mr Richard Kuppusamy, 47, who holds a leadership role at a multinational company and uses a wheelchair having being born with spina bifida , said Singapore has also made progress in terms of physical accessibility. “In Singapore, we’re good with the nuts and bolts of infrastructure,” said Mr Kuppusamy, who is also an adviser to the Disabled People’s Association. “You can spend money to adapt the environment and make it accessible to people.” He said he had a good experience with his employer when he returned to Singapore to work as an architect in 2012. His then-employer, WOHA Architects, had used a grant to renovate its entire shophouse office to make it wheelchair accessible for Mr Kuppusamy. A significant challenge that the disabled community still has to grapple with is the lack of awareness about disability in general. Ms Emily Ong, senior director of employment and lifelong learning at SG Enable, said: “In the workplace, some misconceptions about persons with disabilities are that they require more effort to integrate into the work environment or are less productive.” SG Enable is the main government-linked agency that seeks to help persons with disabilities to live and work in an inclusive society. Mr Shalom Lim, 28, said that while there have been improvements in the last 10 years, social stigma remains a main barrier for persons with disabilities at the workplace. “There is the issue of marketability and the age-old trope that we are less capable because we will be less productive and therefore undesirable as employees or as candidates,” said Mr Lim, whose last job was a community partnerships executive at K9Assistance. Mr Lim has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare genetic disease characterised by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, as well as ADHD. “People are not aware (of the experience of disabled persons) and not accepting, and there is no avenue for persons with disabilities to go through if we are discriminated against.” Mr Lim added that because there is currently no discrimination law for disability, hiring managers can easily dismiss a disabled individual as “not a good fit”. However, Singapore is planning to introduce Workplace Fairness Legislation , which will give people facing workplace discrimination legal teeth to seek redress at all stages of their employment such as during hiring, promotion and dismissal. Persons with disabilities interviewed by TODAY said they hope the proposed legislation will help curb workplace discrimination, and also address the need for employers to provide reasonable accommodations, that is, modifications or adjustments that enable disabled individuals to perform their given tasks. Mr Max Soh, a research and policy manager at the Disabled People’s Association, said that while some employers are well-meaning, there is a “lack of mainstreaming of reasonable accommodation protocols”, and persons with disabilities are afraid to ask for them. “Another misconception is that reasonable accommodations are special advantages or special treatment or something that employers should be rewarded for providing, but by definition, reasonable accommodations are essential and necessary modifications for persons with disabilities .” Besides encouraging employers to make reasonable accommodations, job crafting is another solution — with employers creating jobs that focus on the strengths of persons with disabilities . As an indie filmmaker who casts actors with various disabilities in her films, Ms Reena makes it a point to tailor the job to the actor. For example, she had an actor with ADHD who had trouble memorising lines, so she told him that for his scenes, he could improvise instead, and she would edit around it. Job crafting is especially important in the neurodivergent space. Ms Jacelyn Lim, executive director of Autism Resource Centre (Singapore), said: “Jobs must fit the strengths of individuals on the autism spectrum.” Advocates added that with reasonable accommodations codified, employees will be more willing and braver to ask for what they need. “I want employers to see the person and not the disability. Look at what a person with disabilities can do and not what they can’t,” said Ms Reena. “Employers forget something vital. A person with disabilities has many struggles that have built up their character. This makes them resourceful, determined, and hardworking. These are traits you want in your employees.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — As a 20-something fresh out of university in 2007, Ms Reena Deen thoroughly enjoyed her first job as a teaching aide in a primary school.

SINGAPORE — As a 20-something fresh out of university in 2007, Ms Reena Deen thoroughly enjoyed her first job as a teaching aide in a primary school. But there was a hitch: She was bogged down by administrative tasks due to her dyslexia. Dyslexia is a learning disability that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling.

While she had a good relationship with her colleagues and manager, she didn’t feel comfortable enough to share with them her problems or struggles for fear that she might lose her job. “The only thing we learned how to do over the years is we don't really tell people that we have this issue (disability) because if you do that, you’re instantly going to be stigmatised,” said the freelance tuition teacher and indie filmmaker. “I internalised everything everyone was telling me, that I was just not focused.” When it comes to speaking about disabilities, especially invisible ones like hers, Ms Reena, now 41, has noticed a marked difference in attitudes over the years since she started working For one, she feels safe enough in her current tuition centre — her workplace for the past three years — to speak openly about her dyslexia, thanks to her manager. Ms Reena’s manager had shared that her son had Asperger’s Syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and she was getting him help. This gave Ms Reena the confidence to be more upfront about her condition, even with her young charges. “This is the first time in a tuition centre that I can openly share with my students about my dyslexia,” she said. Unlike in the past, Ms Reena can now discuss with her manager if she spots a child at the tuition centre who might be facing the same problems she had had with dyslexia. “I think, in a way, things are changing. But then again, I know my experience (of being open about her dyslexia with her manager) is an exception, not the norm.” Agreeing with Ms Reena, 26-year-old Jonathan Tiong, who has type-2 spinal muscular atrophy , said that employment opportunities for persons with disabilities have improved in recent years. Mr Tiong used SG Enable — the main government-linked agency for persons with disabilities — to secure an internship as a compulsory module for his university course. SG Enable is a registered charity set up by the Ministry of Social and Family Development in 2013 that seeks to help persons with disabilities to live and work in an inclusive society. After his five-month internship at GIC in 2019, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund offered Mr Tiong a full-time position in corporate communications and employee engagement — a full 18 months before he was due to graduate. “In the past, without SG Enable, I don’t think any person with disabilities can secure any job on their own,” said Mr Tiong, currently an associate in talent and organisation strategies of the human resource department at GIC. Mr Tiong added that he had tried looking for another position without SG Enable as an “exercise”. He managed to secure an interview and even got an offer from the company, which he turned down. “I did the whole thing by myself, and the fact that I managed to secure something — I think I’m quite happy with that,” said Mr Tiong, even though he noted that searching for companies that actively hired persons with disabilities was challenging. “It shows me there is hope for people with disabilities, that it is possible,” said Mr Tiong, who attributed his success in securing another job offer to having worked for three years at GIC. Indeed, persons with disabilities and advocates for them told TODAY that Singapore has made good progress in fostering a more inclusive workplace environment and boosting employment opportunities for people with disabilities. They cited government grants and support, such as the Open Door Programme and the Enabling Employment Credit, as important initiatives that have helped boost inclusive hiring. They also pointed to the Enabling Masterplan 2030, announced in 2022, which outlines a roadmap of 29 recommendations to support persons with disabilities. The recommendations include a target of 40 per cent of people with disabilities to be employed by 2030, up from 32.7 per cent in 2022-2023. While some disability advocates said that this goal is both “ambitious” and “achievable”, they added that more needs to be done to increase employers' awareness of disability to better integrate people with disabilities into the working world. For example, the 40 per cent employment rate needs to be further unpacked to determine what constitutes being “gainfully employed”. Referring to the current situation, Ms Cassandra Chiu, president of the Disabled People’s Association, wondered what proportion of people with disabilities who are employed are also underemployed, where they hold jobs that are way below their skill set. “The challenges we face as persons with disabilities are to be given real jobs and not created jobs,” said Ms Chiu. Beyond increasing the employment rate, disability advocates highlighted other challenges, such as career progression and mobility for persons with disabilities. As Singapore marked Labour Day on May 1, TODAY looks at how workplace awareness has increased and how far mindsets have shifted when it comes to hiring persons with disabilities. While there is still room for improvement, disability organisations and advocates said that Singapore has made strides in trying to level the playing field for people with disabilities at the workplace. In Singapore, the prevalence of disability is 2.1 per cent of the student population, which is approximately 460,000. For those aged 18 to 49, the prevalence of disability is at 3.4 per cent and it stands at 13.3 per cent of the resident population aged 50 and above. Resident employment rate for persons with disabilities aged 15 to 64 has increased from 28.2 per cent in the period of 2018-2019 when such data was first collected, to 30.1 per cent in 2020-2021 and to 31.4 per cent in 2021-2022. From 2018-2019 to 2022-2023 , the nominal median gross monthly income from work (including employer Central Provident Fund contributions) of full-time employed persons with disabilities rose by 4.0 per cent from S$2,630 to S$$4,242. Mr Nasrul Rohmat, executive director of My Inspiring Journey (MIJ) Hub, said: “Over the past years, there have definitely been more resources from the Government and more employers who start to open up and want to employ those with special needs.” MIJ Hub is a non-profit organisation that provides educational services for individuals with intellectual disabilities aged three to 30. Ms Chiu, who is blind, added: “If we look at the last 20 years or so in terms of employment of persons with disabilities, I think there are a lot more schemes currently.” She is also the executive director of K9Assistance, a charity promoting the use and acceptance of assistance dogs for people with disabilities in Singapore. Ms Chiu remembers graduating with a Masters in Counselling in 2011 and how difficult it was to get a job as a school counsellor in public schools. When she finally got a job with a private firm counselling inmates at Changi Prison, she discovered that her salary was half that of her peers, at S$1,800 before Central Provident Fund deductions. She was also not provided with a laptop equipped with accessibility software to do her work, so Ms Chiu had to bring her own to the workplace. “I wasn't able to do my job because there were attitudes or mindsets that a blind person could not do the job because it was dangerous or whatever the reason,” she said. Mr Winston Wong, 35, who is hard of hearing, recalls how his first job in 2014 at a government body was rather unpleasant, when he was tasked with taking minutes of its meetings. Mr Wong lip-reads to communicate with people, which prevents him from multitasking and taking landline calls. “I was forced to take meeting minutes because I was a fresh graduate, and to be honest, nobody wanted to do it,” he said. When Mr Wong said he would not be able to do a good job, his manager insisted and partnered him with a colleague. “Most of the meeting minutes were taken by the partner because it was very hard for me. I think my performance review was affected because of this,” said Mr Wong. The situation has changed since both Ms Chiu and Mr Wong entered the workforce. Ms Chiu cited government schemes such as the Enabling Employment Credit and the Open Door Programme that support employers in hiring people with disabilities as a factor. The Enabling Employment Credit offsets up to 20 per cent of wages and is capped at S$400 per month for each employee. The Open Door Programme encourages employers to hire, train and integrate persons with disabilities through recruitment, job placement and job support services. In 2022, close to 6,600 organisations received the EEC and collectively employed more than 10,000 employees with disabilities, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in a parliamentary reply in October 2023. In response to queries from TODAY, an MSF spokesperson said that between 2021 and 2023, there has been a 66 per cent increase in the placements of persons with disabilities by SG Enable and its job placement partners, with a total of 1,900 placed in employment. Sharing Ms Chiu’s sentiment, Mr Nasrul noted that many changes have occurred in the past 10 years, and the Government has made “a lot of investment” in the disability space. “That alone is hope for us, compared to our neighbouring countries, where resources are limited for them,” he said. Mr Richard Kuppusamy, 47, who holds a leadership role at a multinational company and uses a wheelchair having being born with spina bifida , said Singapore has also made progress in terms of physical accessibility. This includes building infrastructure for those with hearing or visual impairment, or calm rooms for those sensitive to sensory stimuli and overload. For example, the Building Control Act was amended in 2020 to require owners of existing non-barrier-free buildings with public access to provide at least basic accessibility features for people with disabilities. These features include a wheelchair-accessible entrance, a wheelchair-accessible route at the entrance level and a wheelchair-accessible toilet. “In Singapore, we’re good with the nuts and bolts of infrastructure,” said Mr Kuppusamy, who is also an adviser to the Disabled People’s Association. “You can spend money to adapt the environment and make it accessible to people.” Mr Kuppusamy grew up in the United Kingdom, where he studied and worked as an architect for 16 years. He said he had a good experience with his employer when he returned to Singapore to work as an architect in 2012. His then-employer, WOHA Architects, had used a grant to renovate its entire shophouse office to make it wheelchair accessible for Mr Kuppusamy. While his story was impressive, he said it was a “total outlier” and not representative of the experience of the disabled community at large. “We're pretty good at infrastructure; it's what people see,” said Mr Kuppusamy. “What they don't see is the behaviour and how we treat other people.” Thoroughly burnt out from his first job at the government body, Mr Wong left it after nearly two years and later moved on to become a special needs officer at Nanyang Technological University in 2017 and then at Temasek Polytechnic in 2019, where he remained for five years. Working at these two educational institutions helping students with special needs was like “night and day” compared to his first job. His managers were aware of his disability and took active steps to accommodate him. Mr Wong remembers how his manager at Temasek Polytechnic would proactively request colleagues to remove their face masks to ensure Mr Wong could lip-read and keep up. Similarly, Mr Ian Tang’s manager at the National Trades Union Congress where he works in marketing was proactive in ensuring Mr Tang felt supported in his new working environment. Mr Tang had suffered a stroke in 2018 which affected the left side of his body, particularly the use of his left hand and leg. While he has regained some mobility, walking around is very tiring for Mr Tang, as his right side does most of the work. A motorised wheelchair has greatly helped Mr Tang get from one place to another. “Lifts and ramps are good, but they are not enough,” said Mr Tang. He added that if an employer wants to hire a person with disability, everyone from managers to employees has to support this person as part of the company’s culture. In one instance, his human resource department helped Mr Tang plot his route from his home to his office to ensure it was sheltered. He remembers how accommodating and proactive his manager was in asking him if he needed a bigger desk or if he wanted to work closer to the door. Even though the office had a one-day work-from-home culture, Mr Tang's manager offered an arrangement where he could work from home if needed. Apart from doing the job itself, another important activity at work is socialising with colleagues and feeling included within the team. This can be as simple as going out for lunch together or participating in office traditions. For Mr Tiong of GIC, the sense of inclusion was clear from the start when his manager told him that it was a tradition for new employees to bring sweet treats. So, on his first day, Mr Tiong brought doughnuts for everyone, which was “a lot of fun”. “I like to tell this story because the manager is being inclusive. She is not saying, oh, he's disabled, don't let him do it,” said Mr Tiong. “It was something reasonably I could do. “These are small gestures, but they make you feel included and part of the team.” Mr Peter Goh, director of human resource and organisation at GIC, said he was spurred to create a disability inclusion initiative at the firm after hearing how a colleague’s two autistic sons had trouble finding employment. “I realised that being a large company, GIC is able to help promote inclusiveness towards people with disability, particularly in employment settings,” said Mr Goh. In 2019, it launched the GIC Enable Programme with a series of initiatives, such as joining the Singapore Business Network on Disability as a member organisation and establishing a partnership with SG Enable. “Other than Jonathan Tiong, we are excited to welcome three more full-time hires with disabilities this year, and they will be joining us after finishing up their university studies,” said Mr Goh. “All (four) were converted after proving their capability to perform at the high standards expected at GIC during their internship stints,” he added. For youths hoping to have an easier transition to the working world, internships often provide experience and exposure that will come in handy when they graduate. SG Enable has been instrumental for disabled individuals like Ms Soh Yu Hui, 22, who secured her last three internships through the agency. She has Morquio’s syndrome, a progressive genetic disorder that affects one’s bones and spine, organs, and physical abilities. She is currently fully reliant on a powered wheelchair and has limited mobility, such as raising her arms and opening laptops. Ms Soh described the job-hunting process with SG Enable as “simple”, with prospective employers having been filtered to those keen to hire persons with disabilities. Ms Soh, who is currently working as a media intern at a global advertising firm, said: “Listing down companies that are open to hiring persons with disabilities has increased my confidence in my job search, and it also ensures that my employers are concerned about my career progression.” Like Ms Soh, Mr Danial Asri, 24, who is autistic, used SG Enable to obtain his past two internships, and enjoyed himself both times. His first internship was six months as a microbiology lab assistant, and his second was at the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre for three months. The University of London student majoring in international relations said his managers readily accommodated his need for clear instructions and a quiet corner for his desk. Despite the positive internship experience, Mr Danial — like many young graduates — is both nervous and excited about joining the workforce after getting his degree in August. “Naturally, I’m concerned that not all companies will be that inclusive, so I’m a bit anxious about that,” he said. Ms Soh feels “quite hopeful” about employment opportunities, especially if work-from-home arrangements are becoming the norm. “More emphasis is placed on one’s skill set rather than the disability,” she said. Still, she hopes there will be a day when disabled individuals will not need to rely on SG Enable to look for employment. “Job opportunities should be skill-focused and not based on our physical appearance.” Besides employment support such as vocational assessment and job placement, SG Enable also offers courses to equip disabled individuals with skills. Through its programmes, SG Enable has placed more than 5,500 persons with disabilities in jobs since 2014, in addition to those who found jobs on their own or with their existing network of support, said Ms Emily Ong, the agency's senior director of employment and lifelong learning. Ms Ong added: “We ought to move from sympathy to empathy — to see past the disability, focus on abilities, and make inclusion the norm.” A significant challenge that the disabled community still has to grapple with is the lack of awareness about disability in general. Ms Ong said: “In the workplace, some misconceptions about persons with disabilities are that they require more effort to integrate into the work environment or are less productive.” Agreeing, Mr Abhimanyau Pal, chief executive officer of SPD (formerly known as Society of the Physically Disabled), added that some employers may be hesitant to hire persons with disabilities as they are unsure if these individuals are able to perform job tasks as effectively as non-disabled employees. “Their perceived risk of potential productivity losses or the need for additional training have deterred employers from adopting inclusive practices.” Mr Shalom Lim, 28, said that while there have been improvements in the last 10 years, social stigma remains a main barrier for people with disabilities at the workplace. “There is the issue of marketability and the age-old trope that we are less capable because we will be less productive and therefore undesirable as employees or as candidates,” said Mr Lim, whose last job was a community partnerships executive at K9Assistance. Mr Lim has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare genetic disease characterised by progressive muscle weakness and wasting, as well as ADHD. “People are not aware (of the experience of disabled persons) and not accepting, and there is no avenue for persons with disabilities to go through if we are discriminated against.” Mr Lim added that because there is currently no discrimination law for disability, hiring managers can easily dismiss persons with disabilities as “not a good fit”. However, Singapore is planning to introduce Workplace Fairness Legislation , which will give people facing workplace discrimination legal teeth to seek redress at all stages of their employment such as during hiring, promotion and dismissal. Persons with disabilities interviewed by TODAY said they hope the proposed legislation will help curb workplace discrimination, and also address the need for employers to provide reasonable accommodations, that is, modifications or adjustments that enable disabled individuals to perform their given work tasks. The Tripartite Committee for Workplace Fairness had in 2023 outlined 22 recommendations for the proposed legislation which the Government had accepted. These recommendations include the issuance of a tripartite advisory which will provide guidance to employers and employees on the provision of reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities, rather than legislating such a requirement. Currently, when employers think about accommodations, they immediately get defensive, said Ms Kavita Chandradhas, 38, founder of Undivided, a diversity, equity and inclusion consulting practice focused on neurodiversity, mental health and invisible disabilities at the workplace. “The first thing employers think of when they hear accommodations, they think it's going to mean a lot of money,” she said. “But the reality is that the cost of accommodations for disabled people is actually usually zero or it's very low cost.” For example, employees with sensory sensitivity can lie in a dark, quiet room or have flexible working arrangements. “If employers empathise with the situation, they will understand, and they will go the extra mile to meet the needs,” said Ms Faraliza Zainal, chairman of MIJ Hub. Mr Max Soh, a research and policy manager at the Disabled People’s Association, said that while some employers are well-meaning, there is a “lack of mainstreaming of reasonable accommodation protocols”, and persons with disabilities are afraid to ask for them. “Another misconception is that reasonable accommodations are special advantages or special treatment or something that employers should be rewarded for providing, but by definition, reasonable accommodations are essential and necessary modifications for persons with disabilities .” Mr Soh said that without these reasonable accommodations, the workplace environment would sometimes be “very arduous” or even impossible for disabled individuals to participate in. Of course, this does not mean that all accommodation requests should be accepted, he added. Instead, at the very least, employers should engage in that conversation with their employees. In response to a parliamentary question, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng said on Tuesday (May 7) that the tripartite partners will be engaging community groups to develop the tripartite advisory on reasonable accommodations and aim to release the advisory around the same time as the introduction of the Workplace Fairness Legislation. “The most direct way of measuring the effectiveness of a workplace accommodation for employees with disabilities is by considering the employment outcome for the supported employee,” said Dr Tan. He added that the advisory, while not a part of the Workplace Fairness Legislation, will complement the new law which prohibits workplace discrimination on the basis of disability. Most persons with disabilities who are employed work in office or backend roles that do not deal with customers or the public. However, some businesses employ persons with disabilities in frontline roles. One such establishment is Foreword Coffee Roasters, a social enterprise with seven outlets across the island where persons with disabilities work as cashiers, waiters and baristas, among other roles. Its co-founder Lim Wei Jie, 32, said that public reception of these workers at various Foreword Coffee outlets has been “generally positive”. Of course, there are “bad times” when miscommunication result in wrong orders, said Mr Lim. Then, just like any normal cafe, the staff would have to replace the order. Mr Lim added that for first-time customers, interactions can be a longer if the server is deaf and customers have to use gestures to indicate their order. “The deaf staff are very happy to share about sign language for the people who want to interact with them.” A patron of Foreword Coffee Roasters located at the National University of Singapore, Ms Kyueun Kim, 35, said that while there were some hiccups in her first interaction with a deaf server, she quickly adapted and learned how to communicate with him. “At one point, we became more friendly with our interactions, and we had our own way of saying hi and all that,” said Ms Kim. At social enterprise Mushroom Buddies, public perception towards its workers who have disabilities has been positive as well. The mushroom farm located at Sprout Hub along Henderson Road was started by E4PID Co-op (Employment 4 Persons with Intellectual Disabilities). The farm has seven staff with intellectual disabilities who are paired with volunteers. While the farm largely supplies to supermarkets and restaurants, it also takes up in the occasional farmer’s market at Sprout Hub. “I believe most of the public members we have interacted with have been supportive of our social mission and appreciative of the effort that has gone into our farming business that hires a majority of our staff who are persons with disabilities,” said Mr Bernard Yu, treasurer of E4PID. Several eateries at Enabling Village — an integrated community space in Lengkok Bahru for persons with disabilities — also employ these individuals as frontline staff. “The public should give them the opportunity to serve,” said Ms YY, a homemaker in her 60s and a Lengkok Bahru resident who declined to give her full name. She has patronised these eateries at Enabling Village and called the experience, including with the servers who have disabilities, “pleasant”. “We always think that people who behave differently from us are ‘abnormal’, but I think that is very discriminating,” she added. While disability advocates welcomed the Enabling Masterplan 2030 and the employment target of 40 per cent, some wondered how gainful employment would be measured. Mr Kuppusamy said many people with disabilities are currently working in jobs such as delivery riders or in call centres or the service industry that are not highly paid. They are afraid of losing their jobs and might even be vulnerable to abuse by having to accept unfair work practices. As such, ascertaining how Singapore is going to meaningfully attain that 40 per cent employment is important, advocates for persons with disabilities said. They added that the issue of career mobility and progression for workers with disabilities also needs to be addressed. “I've got friends who have entered companies straight out of university, and 20 to 25 years on, they're only earning S$4,000. That's not better than a fresh grad going into work nowadays, which is sad,” said Ms Chiu. Mr Soh said that anecdotally, disabled individuals under the Place-and-Train Programme are often let go after six to 12 months. Due to a lack of data, it is difficult for him to ascertain the exact retention rates. The programme offers funding support to inclusive employers and aims to encourage them to provide job and training opportunities for people with disabilities. For the first six to 12 months, salaries are subsidised up to 90 per cent to support employers. The programme is funded by the Ministry of Social and Family Development and administered by SG Enable. To ensure more equitable employment opportunities for people with disabilities and to make the workplace more inclusive, a whole-of-society approach is the way forward, said advocates. “To achieve the 40 per cent target set out in Enabling Masterplan 2030, a 3P approach — people, private, and public sectors — is needed, where different stakeholders play their part and are proactive in improving job opportunities for persons with disabilities,” suggested Mr Pal of SPD. For one, given that the Government is the biggest employer in the country, said Ms Chiu, “if a quota exists there (civil service), half the battle is won”. “We will probably be in the 40 per cent or even a little bit more, more than that.” Mr Pal added that inculcating the right mindset and building a proper ecosystem, such as inclusive infrastructure and policies, will support inclusive hiring practices. Besides encouraging employers to make reasonable accommodations, job crafting is another solution — with employers creating jobs that focus on the strengths of people with disabilities. For example, Ms Chiu has crafted the part-time role of community partnerships executive at K9Assistance for Mr Lim, taking into account his limited mobility and neurodivergent needs. As an indie filmmaker who casts actors with various disabilities in her films, Ms Reena makes it a point to tailor the job to the actor. For example, she had an actor with ADHD who had trouble memorising lines, so she told him that for his scenes, he could improvise instead, and she would edit around it. Job crafting is especially important in the neurodivergent space. Ms Jacelyn Lim, executive director of Autism Resource Centre (Singapore), said: “Jobs must fit the strengths of individuals on the autism spectrum.” “Like all of us, individuals on the autism spectrum have their strengths, interests, and abilities. “They work best in structured environments with clear tasks and deliverables. Employers must be willing to redesign or restructure some work processes, where possible, to leverage their strengths,” Ms Lim said. Advocates added that with reasonable accommodations codified, employees will be more willing and braver to ask for what they need. “I want employers to see the person and not the disability. Look at what a person with disabilities can do and not what they can’t,” said Ms Reena. “Employers forget something vital. A person with disabilities has many struggles that have built up their character. This makes them resourceful, determined, and hardworking. These are traits you want in your employees.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Experts and motorists TODAY spoke to believe a mix of stricter penalties, utilisation of speed-limiting technology in vehicles and continued education is the right way forward for safer roads. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Just two weeks ago, a driver who decided to ignore the directional signs in a multi-storey car park in Chua Chu Kang almost collided into the vehicle that digital marketing manager Marcus Khoo was driving. This near-miss, alongside his increasing observations of drivers who hog lanes, display road rage and blatantly flout the rules, has led Mr Khoo, 29, to believe that the behaviour of motorists on the road has regressed — “more so than ever” since the easing of Covid-19 restrictions. In TODAY’s conversations with seven motorists who have driven for at least five years, the sentiment is near-unanimous: Drivers' behaviours have been getting worse. In recent months, Singapore has been gripped by several high-profile traffic accidents that have shone a spotlight on the country’s traffic safety measures, and by extension its road culture. On Jan 23, a four-year-old was walking home from her preschool in River Valley when a car turned a bend and hit her . Barely a week later, a 12-year-old girl was on her way home from school in Taman Jurong when a van hit her . Both children died in the accidents. Last month, a multi-vehicle crash at the junction of Tampines Avenue 1 and Tampines Avenue 4 injured eight people and took the lives of 17-year-old student Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril , and 57-year-old Norzihan Juwahib, who worked at a pest control company. With traffic safety matters prevalent in Singaporeans’ collective consciousness of late, the issue was raised in Parliament this week, after several Members of Parliament (MPs) filed questions on what measures could be taken to improve road safety for users and whether the Ministry of Home Affairs would consider implementing mandatory speed limiters on all motor vehicles. MPs also asked whether existing penalties under the Road Traffic Act 1961 should be reviewed. In response to these questions on Tuesday (May 7), Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said that the penalties under the Road Traffic Act — which had been raised significantly in July 2019 — “are already quite stiff” and adequate to deter dangerous driving . The Road Traffic Act was amended almost five years ago to increase the maximum penalties for irresponsible driving offences like death or grievous hurt caused by dangerous driving, and for traffic offences committed while under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Associate Professor Faishal said that Singapore’s roads “have become safer” too, as the number of accidents resulting in injuries or fatalities fell by about 10 per cent from 7,822 in 2019 to 7,075 in 2023. Indeed, according to data gleaned from the Annual Road Traffic Situation reports published by the Singapore Police Force, there was a consistent decrease in the number of traffic accidents resulting in fatalities in Singapore from 2011 to 2019. The 117 accidents reported in 2019 represented a 39.1 per cent decrease from the 192 reported eight years before in 2011. This number dropped further to 80 in 2020 — when lockdown measures were implemented due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to transport engineering consultant Gopinath Menon, this fall in fatality-causing accidents is indicative of Singapore “moving in the right direction on road safety”. But s ince the start of the pandemic in 2020, the number of traffic accidents resulting in both fatalities and injuries has increased year-on-year. From 2020 to 2023, the number of fatality-causing accidents jumped by 63 per cent from 80 to 131, while accidents resulting in injuries went up by 26.8 per cent from 5,476 to 6,944. Overall, the road traffic fatality rate per 100,000 population increased from 1.46 in 2020 to 2.3 in 2023. This means that in 2023, around two out of every 100,000 people died from a road accident. This was the highest since 2016 , when the road traffic fatality rate was 2.51 per 100,000. Additionally, a Singlife spokesperson told TODAY that the insurance company saw a relative increase in motor accident claims from 2021 to 2023, “often resulting from distracted driving induced by electronic devices, speeding, reckless driving and adverse weather conditions”. While it is not surprising that 2020’s numbers were lower, should the rise in fatality- and injury-causing accidents for the three consecutive years since be a cause for concern? Law lecturer at Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Ben Chester Cheong thinks so, calling the increase a “worrying trend that should not be taken lightly”. “Road safety is a critical issue that affects everyone, and any regression in this area can have severe consequences for individuals, families, and society,” he said. What could be behind Singapore’s apparent recent regression in road safety? TODAY looks at the potential causes and what can be done to improve the situation on the roads. Being forced to stay at home more often at the onset of the pandemic may have caused a deterioration in safety standards on the roads, according to Mr Khoo, Mr Gopinath and several other motorists TODAY spoke to. With fewer vehicles on the roads back in 2020, “some drivers might have developed a habit of speeding or driving less cautiously due to the perceived lack of traffic”, said Mr Cheong of SUSS. He added that the significant stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges that the pandemic caused for many people may have also led to more distracted and aggressive driving. Indeed, there have been multiple studies in the region and beyond that have lent credence to Mr Cheong's perspective, indicating that Covid-19 has had a profound and lasting impact on road accidents and driver behaviour. For instance, a Spanish study conducted in 2021 compared the driving styles of 30 participants before and after the pandemic. The findings, published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Access Journal, showed that the drivers had adopted a more aggressive driving style since the pandemic, particularly those who had experienced anxiety because of Covid-19. The Australian Road Safety Foundation’s annual research report in 2020 also showed that one in four drivers admitted to taking increased road risks since the implementation of Covid-19 lockdowns. The foundation said this is likely driven by complacency and the fact that two thirds of Australians believe the roads are safer because of lower traffic volumes and congestion. A separate study in the United States found that the aggression and inattention of drivers considerably increased following the emergence of Covid-19, resulting in a greater chance of serious collisions. It measured aggressiveness using crash data, which captured instances of drivers speeding and drink-driving, while inattentiveness was measured by instances of motorists being unbelted, distracted or failing to signal. Closer to home, a Malaysian study published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health in 2022 found that young drivers in particular drove significantly faster and performed more aggressive steering actions during the Covid-19 lockdown than at any other time. While there have not been studies examining the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on motorists’ behaviours on roads in Singapore, Mr Gopinath said it is possible that these findings apply here too. “Many drivers may have resorted to going at high speeds because they were able to do so. “Impatience and general frustration because of the severe restrictions on the quality of life may have led to more red light running and reckless driving,” he said. In fact, from 2020 to 2022, the number of speeding-related accidents here did increase by 50 per cent (from 757 to 1,138), though that figure dropped sharply by 45 per cent to 624 cases in 2023. But not all are convinced that Covid-19 had anything to do with road behaviours. Data analyst Mohamed Aqmal, 27, believes that what he observes to be a “notable increase in reckless driving” simply boils down to “a continued manifestation\" of road habits that have always been common in Singapore. Transport economist Walter Theseira said that while there are correlations between Covid-19 and road safety, existing studies do not prove any hypotheses which point to a cause and effect between the two, and merely point out the differences in behaviour of selected motorists before and after the pandemic. It is also interesting to note that despite fatalities and injuries from traffic accidents rising for three consecutive years, red light and speeding violations recorded have simultaneously and consistently fallen over the same period. From 2020 to 2023, the number of red-light violations decreased by 38.2 per cent (51,459 to 31,815), with speeding violations dropping by 29.4 per cent (163,823 to 115,705). However, statistics on such violations are more co-related with enforcement action than statistics on accidents. One motorist, 28-year-old media creative Harris Iskandar, believes that this perception of increasingly unsafe roads may have been created inadvertently by the ubiquitous use of smart devices. “Rather than it getting worse, (traffic) incidents are now easily made known to the masses due to the advent of social media,” said Mr Iskandar, who has been driving for eight years. Pandemic aside, the past decade has seen several key changes in the way Singaporean motorists commute — specifically the emergence of ride-hailing applications like Uber and Grab in 2013, and the more recent popularity of car-sharing services. As of end-June 2023, the private-hire car population stood at 76,686 — just 455 units shy of the peak in 2019 when there were 77,141 cars for self-drive rental and ride-hailing. For car-sharing, GetGo told TODAY in January this year that it launched its service in February 2021 with 10,000 users, but now serves over 350,000 registered users. Tribecar, founded in 2016, said it has seen an average of a 30 per cent year-on-year increase in registered users over the past three years, though it declined to reveal its total customer base. Studies abroad have indicated that both ride-hailing and car-sharing have an impact on road safety figures, though they point in opposing directions. In January 2023, an accident in Yishun involving a GetGo car and an SBS Transit bus resulted in the death of the car driver and injuries to seven bus passengers, which raised concerns about the safety of car-sharing services then. One 2019 study in South Korea found a causal relationship between the presence of a car-sharing service in an urban area and the number of car accidents there. The more users a car-sharing service had in a market, the more accidents were recorded — particularly among experienced drivers, which the study defined as someone who has had a driver’s licence for at least three years. According to the researchers, its results indicate that experienced drivers who used car-sharing services may show irresponsible attitudes or enhanced violence when driving a car, whereas inexperienced users’ attitude towards driving were stable regardless of whether they used shared cars. But car-sharing’s impact on Singapore specifically is harder to quantify. The Traffic Police does not track whether vehicles involved in accidents are car-sharing vehicles or not, said Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam in a written response to a parliamentary question by MP for Aljunied Group Representation Constituency Gerald Giam in February 2023. In response to TODAY’s queries, car-sharing company Tribecar said that it sees “less than a handful” road accident cases per 100,000 bookings and has had no reports of injuries or fatalities from its users. Similarly, GetGo said that its accident rate as measured against usage remained consistent from 2022 to 2023 and decreased as of the first quarter of 2024. Both companies did not provide figures. As for ride-hailing, multiple studies overseas have shown that the presence of these options in a city tends to decrease fatal vehicular crashes. A US nationwide study in 2018 found that once Uber has operated in a county for four or more years, fatal crashes decline by 17 to 40 per cent. This is consistent with Singapore’s trend of declining fatality figures resulting from traffic accidents since ride-hailing apps entered the market in 2013. In response to TODAY's queries, a Gojek spokesperson said 99.99 per cent of rides on the platform in 2023 were accident-free, although no figures were provided for preceding years. Both Gojek and TADA said that their platforms also include safety features for its drivers, such as regular in-app reminders to rest, with the former also offering in-app learning modules on safe driving. Additionally, a 2021 study in Spain showed that ride-hailing services were associated not only with a decrease in fatal and serious accidents in Madrid, but also a reduction of accidents related to alcohol. While there has been no significant change in the number of drink-driving accidents recorded in Singapore over the past decade, the number of persons arrested for drink-driving did decrease year-on-year from 2013 to 2021 (from 3,019 to 1,453), before increasing slightly in 2022. The police did not provide figures for how many people were arrested for drink-driving in 2023 in its latest Annual Road Traffic Situation report. In that same report published in February this year, the Traffic Police said that it would, in view of the increase in number of accidents and fatalities: ● Increase enforcement efforts ● Turn on the speed enforcement function in more red light cameras ● Revise composition sums and demerit points for traffic offences ● Intensify education and engagement efforts to encourage good road safety habits The speed enforcement function in red-light cameras had been progressively activated from April 1 in an effort to improve motorist behaviour on roads, and the police said last month that those cameras had detected more than 800 speeding violations in the first three weeks. Experts and motorists TODAY spoke to were largely in favour of these actions, but also offered various suggestions on how to further improve road safety. Some said stricter penalties should be in place to further discourage errant behaviour on the roads. At present, for an offence of dangerous driving causing death, a first-time offender is liable for imprisonment of two to eight years. Mr Cheong, the SUSS law lecturer, pointed out that the state of Queensland in Australia recently proposed legislation that would provide for imprisonment of up to 20 years for the same offence. He said that introducing harsher penalties can lead to increased deterrence for reckless driving and raise more public awareness about the seriousness of road safety issues. “In the past, it may not be practical or fair to impose severe penalties for traffic offences because of the difficulty in evidence collection and the difficulty in ascribing culpability (or blame) for an accident,” Mr Cheong said. “But now with in-car cameras, surveillance cameras, and camera footage from other vehicles, it is becoming very clear who caused the accident and who should be most culpable. “Considering the spate of very serious and fatal road accidents in recent times, it is justifiable for more severe punishments, where traffic offences causing death or grievous bodily hurt are concerned,” he added. When it comes to fines for acts like speeding, Singapore’s current system may not be very effective in deterrence, said Associate Professor Theseira, the transport economist from SUSS. At present, those who drive above the speed limit by 1kmh to 20 kmh will be slapped with a S$150 fine and four demerit points. The penalty increases as the speed does too, with those caught going 60kmh above the speed limit potentially facing a S$10,000 fine or imprisonment of up to eight years or both. Assoc Prof Theseira believes Singapore should follow the lead of several Scandinavian countries to implement fines that scale with the traffic offender’s ability to pay. For instance, Finland’s speeding fines are calculated based on an offender’s daily disposable income — generally their daily salary divided by two. In 2015, a Finnish businessman was handed a 54,000-euro (S$78,600) fine for driving 22kmh over the 50kmh speed limit. Thirteen years before that, a former Nokia director was ordered to pay 116,000 euros for a similar offence. “Such a system would make fines of similar meaning to high and low-income offenders and may provide more deterrence than the present system — where a meaningful fine to the average person is likely meaningless to the high income,\" said Assoc Prof Theseira. Another way forward is encouraging the use of various advanced driver assistance systems in vehicles, such as collision warning systems, lane departure warnings and autonomous emergency braking features. In a TODAY commentary earlier this week, SUSS senior lecturer Nicholas Netto suggested equipping all vehicles with Intelligent Speed Assistance technology, where traffic signs can automatically ensure vehicles comply with corresponding speed limits through an onboard communication system. In-car cameras could also become standard in all vehicles, and footage of traffic violations synced via cloud to an artificial intelligence-powered analytics programme administered by the authorities to detect traffic violations, Mr Netto said. Lastly, road safety education initiatives should be ramped up, TODAY’s interviewees said. For one, Mr Cheong believes Singapore should implement mandatory “continuing road safety education” programmes for drivers before licences can be renewed. Agreeing, Mr Benjamin Leow, 31, who is self-employed and has driven for almost 10 years, said the country’s focus should be on cultivating what he calls “road intelligence” — like knowing which lanes to stick to at various speeds and when to use one’s hazard lights, for instance. “It’s unfortunate we have to stoop to such measures, but given we’re a country that advocates lifelong learning, this is a small way to decrease incidents on the road,” he said. In a similar suggestion, MP for Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency Joan Pereira tabled a parliamentary question this week regarding whether the Home Affairs Ministry will consider requiring all drivers to attend periodic refresher courses. In response, Assoc Prof Faishal said on Tuesday: “We do not think it is useful to mandate the refresher course for all motorists. Only a minority of motorists are involved in accidents.” He added that the Traffic Police has been working together with various partners including the Singapore Road Safety Council, SBS Transit and Grab to organise events and campaigns to promote safety and that it will publish a series of road safety videos in the second half of 2024. For 28-year-old data analyst Prashanth Sutty, who owns both a Class 2B and Class 3 licence, errant behaviours on the road boil down to the fact that “many of us are concerned about our own needs and convenience, resulting in a feeling of entitlement”. “I’ve noticed a lot of drivers intentionally speed up to prevent another driver or rider from switching lanes. It’s also concerning to see many drivers refusing to yield at zebra crossings, which I think is very inconsiderate and poses significant danger to pedestrians,” Mr Sutty said. Some motorists like Mr Iskandar believe Singaporeans can take a leaf out of other countries’ books too. Having driven several times in Japan, he said that motorists there mostly follow the rules and are considerate, which “makes driving there so much better”. Mr Leow concurred: “People (overseas) seem more aware that a vehicle on the road is deadly and wish not to harm anyone. Here, on the other hand, it doesn't seem to reflect that manner.” Similar to the views expressed by these motorists, several MPs brought up their own personal anecdotes of their encounters on Singapore’s roads in Parliament this week and questioned whether the nation’s road culture is one characterised by impatience. MP for Hougang Single Member Constituency Dennis Tan said, for instance, that it is common for Singaporeans to honk at a stationary car “as soon as the (traffic) light turns green”. MP for Aljunied Group Representation Constituency Sylvia Lim added that there may be a “permissive attitude towards speed” within our road culture. She shared that in her experiences overseas, it would be common for motorists to honk at others who exceed the speed limit, whereas norms here include honking at and overtaking a vehicle from the left if it is travelling at the speed limit on the right-most lane of an expressway. Assoc Prof Faishal said in response to both Mr Tan and Ms Lim that every person has a part to play in improving road safety. “At the end of the day, we need to internalise this whole element within each of us that there are people around us who also are using the road,” he said. “When you know that these road users have families… I think more care will be applied in the way we use our devices on the road.” He also emphasised that while the Government will do all it can to keep Singapore’s roads safe, “road safety is necessarily a shared responsibility”. While some motorists agree that road safety is a shared responsibility, they still believe that heavier punishments need to be meted out as those who subscribe to the above philosophy tend not to be the people causing accidents in the first place. Mr Khoo, the digital marketing manager, said: “While an individual may be a decent driver, if the driver or motorcyclist around him or her isn’t as vigilant, then the accident still becomes inevitable. “Until the Government takes more steps to enforce and remind (motorists), I honestly think the situation won’t improve and the cycle (of increasing accidents) will just keep repeating.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

While it is not surprising that 2020’s numbers were lower, should the rise in fatality- and injury-causing accidents for three consecutive years be a cause for concern? Law lecturer at Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Ben Chester Cheong thinks so, calling the increase a “worrying trend that should not be taken lightly”. “Road safety is a critical issue that affects everyone, and any regression in this area can have severe consequences for individuals, families, and society,” he said. Being forced to stay at home more often at the onset of the pandemic may have caused a deterioration in safety standards on the roads, according to Mr Khoo, Mr Gopinath and several other motorists TODAY spoke to. With fewer vehicles on the roads back in 2020, “some drivers might have developed a habit of speeding or driving less cautiously due to the perceived lack of traffic”, said Mr Cheong of SUSS. He added that the significant stress, anxiety, and mental health challenges that the pandemic had caused for many people may have also led to more distracted and aggressive driving. Indeed, there have been multiple studies in the region and beyond that have lent credence to Mr Cheong's perspectives, indicating that Covid-19 has had a profound impact on road accidents and driver behaviour. For instance, a Spanish study conducted in 2021 with 30 participants compared their driving styles to that before the pandemic. The findings indicated that drivers had adopted a more aggressive driving style than they did before the pandemic, particularly those who had experienced anxiety because of Covid-19. The Australian Road Safety Foundation’s annual research report in 2020 also showed that one in four drivers admitted to taking increased road risks since the implementation of Covid-19 lockdowns. The foundation said this is likely driven by complacency and the fact that two thirds of Australians believe the roads were safer with lower traffic volumes and congestion. While there have not been studies examining the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on motorists’ behaviours on roads in Singapore, Mr Menon said it is possible that these findings apply to the local context too. “Many drivers may have resorted to going at high speeds because they were able to do so. “Impatience and general frustration because of the severe restrictions on the quality of life may have led to more red light running and reckless driving,” he said. In fact, from 2020 to 2022, the number of speeding related accidents here did increase by 50 per cent (from 757 to 1,138) though that figure dropped sharply by 45 per cent to 624 cases in 2023. It is also interesting to note that despite fatalities and injuries from traffic accidents rising for three straight years, red light and speeding violations recorded have simultaneously and consistently fallen over the same time period. From 2020 to 2023, the number of red-light violations decreased by 38.2 per cent (51,459 to 31,815), with speeding violations dropping by 29.4 per cent (163,823 to 115,705). However, statistics on such violations are more correlated to enforcement action than statistics on accidents. Pandemic aside, the past decade has seen several key changes in the way Singaporean motorists commute — specifically the emergence of ride-hailing applications like Uber and Grab in 2013, and the more recent popularity of car-sharing services. Studies abroad have indicated that both ride-hailing and car-sharing have an impact on road safety figures, though they point in opposing directions. One 2019 study in South Korea found a causal relationship between the presence of a car-sharing service in an urban area and the number of car accidents there. The more users a car-sharing service had in a market, the more accidents were recorded — particularly among experienced drivers, which the study defined as someone who has had a driver’s licence for at least three years. But car-sharing’s impact on Singapore specifically is harder to quantify, as the Traffic Police does not track whether vehicles involved in accidents are car-sharing vehicles or not. On the flip side, multiple studies overseas have shown that the presence of ride-hailing options in a city tends to decrease fatal vehicular crashes. A United States nationwide study in 2018 found that once Uber has operated in a county for four or more years, fatal crashes decline by 17 to 40 per cent. This is consistent with Singapore’s trend of declining fatality figures resulting from traffic accidents since ride-hailing apps entered the market in 2013. Experts and motorists TODAY spoke to said a mix of stricter penalties, utilisation of speed-limiting technology in vehicles and continued education is the right way forward for safer roads in Singapore. Mr Cheong, the SUSS law lecturer, said that introducing harsher penalties can lead to increased deterrence for reckless driving and raise more public awareness about the seriousness of road safety issues. “In the past, it may not be practical or fair to impose severe penalties for traffic offences because of the difficulty in evidence collection and the difficulty in ascribing culpability (or blame) for an accident,” Mr Cheong said. Now, however, the technology exists to identify those culpable clearly, and more severe punishments are justified, he added. In a TODAY commentary earlier this week, SUSS senior lecturer Nicholas Netto suggested equipping all vehicles with Intelligent Speed Assistance technology, where traffic signs can automatically ensure vehicles comply with corresponding speed limits through an onboard communication system. Mr Benjamin Leow, 31, who is self-employed and has driven for almost 10 years, said the country’s focus should be on cultivating what he calls “road intelligence” — like knowing which lanes to stick to at various speeds and when to use one’s hazard lights, for instance. “It’s unfortunate we have to stoop to such measures, but given we’re a country that advocates lifelong learning, this is a small way to decrease incidents on the road,” he said. For 28-year-old data analyst Prashanth Sutty, who owns both a Class 2B and Class 3 licence, the errant behaviours on the road boils down to the fact that “many of us are concerned about our own needs and convenience, resulting in a feeling of entitlement”. In a similar vein, several MPs also brought up their own personal anecdotes of their encounters on Singapore’s roads in Parliament this week and questioned whether the nation’s road culture is one characterised by impatience. MP for Hougang Single Member Constituency Dennis Tan said, for instance, that it is common for Singaporeans to honk at a stationary car “as soon as the (traffic) light turns green”. Assoc Prof Faishal said in response to Mr Tan and other MPs that every person has a part to play in improving road safety. “At the end of the day, we need to internalise this whole element within each of us that there are people around us who also are using the road,” he said. “When you know that these road users have families… I think more care will be applied in the way we use our devices on the road.” He also emphasised that while the Government will do all it can to keep Singapore’s roads safe, “road safety is necessarily a shared responsibility”. While some motorists agree with that sentiment, they still believe that heavier punishments need to be meted out as those who subscribe to the above philosophy tend not to be the people causing accidents in the first place. Mr Khoo, the digital marketing manager, said: “Until the Government takes more steps to enforce and remind (motorists), I honestly think the situation won’t improve and the cycle (of increasing accidents) will just keep repeating.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Workers and experts interviewed by TODAY laid out some factors behind the growing demand for work-life harmony and debunked the notion that this speaks of a workforce which lacks hunger or is uncompetitive. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at how Singapore workers can navigate their growing priority on work-life balance without losing their competitive edge. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — For new mother Nur Sabrina Muhleseddin, being able to enjoy work-life balance is something she values in a job, as it allows her to be present for her son’s milestones. The 29-year-old digital marketing manager said her priorities have shifted since she gave birth in July last year. She was working in a different company previously, but had sought out a new role four months after becoming a mother. Being able to balance work with caring for her son is especially important to Ms Nur Sabrina, whose husband works in the hospitality industry as a shift manager — often having to work irregular hours and on weekends. Her flexible work post-pregnancy would mean that at least one of them — herself or her husband — can be present for their child, she said. Currently, she works almost entirely from home — save for a few in-person meetings with her clients at their offices about once or twice a week. “I think presently, nothing is more important than to be able to witness my son growing up and being around for his milestones. “I’ve had a good few years of working up the ladder. Right now, I just need a job so that I can provide food on the table and share the bills with my husband,” said Ms Nur Sabrina. The approach embraced by Ms Nur Sabrina reflects a growing shift among Singapore workers towards prioritising work-life balance — with many recognising that work is not everything, and hence desiring to spend less time at work and more time on personal pursuits. Recent surveys have shown a growing expectation among the Singapore workforce for greater work-life harmony. A survey done by recruitment agency Randstad in 2023 found that more respondents are prioritising work-life balance over salary : Ninety-five per cent of Singapore workers said that having work-life balance is important to them in their current and future jobs, compared to 90 per cent who said pay is important. Related to the greater yearning for work-life balance is flexible work options, which allow employees to carve out a suitable work-life rhythm tailored to their individual needs at different life stages. From December this year, all firms in Singapore will be required to have a formal process in place for their employees to request for flexible working arrangements . However, the release of the guidelines last month has also reignited debate on the issue of work-life balance and flexible work, which has long attracted polarising sentiments — even to the extent of some questioning whether Singapore workers have increasingly lost their hunger and drive. In the wake of the announcement, some employers had also come out to say that they may even rethink hiring local staff, and instead look overseas for recruitment . The debate also begs the broader question: In resource-scarce Singapore, is it too much for employees to seek a better quality of life by way of better work-life balance? Or must its workforce — as the nation’s prime resource — remain in a perpetual state of being “kiasu” (Singlish for “scared to lose”), for fear of others stealing its rice bowl and ultimately losing its overall competitive edge? Human resource and sociology experts told TODAY that while the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated the demand for better work-life balance and flexible work as more employees recognise the feasibility of such arrangements, the growing expectation for work-life balance is ultimately not a new phenomenon. Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from National University of Singapore (NUS), said that even before working from home became a feature of the new post-pandemic work norm, there has been a “silent but significant value shift towards prioritising work autonomy and quality of life” — and, in turn, work-life balance — with Singapore becoming a more affluent, post-materialist society. Dr Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University, said that the slower economic growth Singapore sees today compared to the past could prompt a new generation of workers to feel like it is “less ‘worth it’ to keep pursuing economic growth”, as they do not enjoy the same extent of progress. “Older cohorts saw palpable change in their living conditions for the sacrifices that they made. Younger cohorts are unlikely to see the same kind of progress, and are probably quickly realising it may be better to invest their time in pursuits that seem more meaningful to them,” said Dr Ang. At the same time, experts also cautioned against the general tendency to assume that the desire for work-life balance is mainly confined to a younger generation of workers. Mr Richard Bradshaw, the Asia chief executive officer of recruitment consultancy Ethos BeathChapman, noted that the desire for better work-life balance has grown to be a “common requirement” across different working demographics and ages today, and to some extent, may even be perceived as a form of “basic workers’ rights”. Employees also disagree with the notion that those who yearn for work-life balance are less hungry for success. Father of three Edwin Ho, 47, said that a person who devotes equal amounts of time to work and personal life can be more successful, productive and fulfilling, than a person who only works hard and spends huge amounts of time at work while sacrificing other matters in life, like spending time with family and friends or travelling. “I think we first must define (our) purpose for working hard and what success is, so that we can work towards that goal and in doing so, learn to find a balance between work and personal life.” The senior associate director at Finexis Advisory made the switch from an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force to his current career in personal finance to be able to spend more time with his children, who are aged 19, 16, and 14 years old. Mr Jivan Tulsiani, head of marketing at blockchain firm TZ APAC, also agreed that a growing demand for work-life balance does not reflect a lack of hunger from employees. “It’s more of a shift in how ambitious professionals define success. It’s important to understand the concept of purpose, which is an aggregate of components such as talent, passion, skills, occupation, charity and service,” he said. With more people yearning for better work-life harmony, the million-dollar question is whether, from employers’ point of view, it is too much to ask for. Some employers, especially those in the services industries, told TODAY that it is difficult to accede to employees’ requests, given the nature of their role and industry. Other challenges they raised include the difficulty of monitoring employees’ productivity and performance when they work remotely or are operating on flexible schedules. Also of concern to employers are potential impacts on business operations and stakeholder relationships, ensuring fair team workload distribution, and any associated costs, said Ms Khew Shu Ping, deputy managing director of public relations agency Tate Anzur. Some employers who recognise the need to afford their employees greater work-life harmony said that they also have such employees who are high achievers. Mr Winthrop Wong, co-founder and pharmacist at e-pharmacy Glovida-Rx, said this is the case of some of its medical sales staff. “We set them qualitative and quantitative goals on a yearly and monthly basis and if they are able to achieve these targets, we basically allow them to schedule their days in what is most productive to them.” Ultimately, there is no need for Singapore workers to remain in a perpetually “kiasu” state — more “work”, less “life” — to ensure they retain their competitive edge, said experts. They pointed out that competitiveness is multi-faceted, and prioritising work-life balance does not have to come at the expense of a workforce’s attractiveness or economic progress. In 2022, the BBC reported that Norway and Denmark had work weeks that were shorter than 40 hours, yet were respectively the second- and seventh-most productive countries in the world then. For one thing, what workers may lose out on in absolute hours put into work can be made up for in other ways, such as increased productivity during the actual time they are at their jobs. Associate Professor Nicholas Sim, from the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ School of Business, said: “While there are trade-offs between competitiveness and work-life balance, it is not necessarily true that work-life balance must be sacrificed to increase competitiveness, particularly if this refers to an increase in productivity.” Highlighting findings from studies which surveyed respondents of various occupations and skill levels, Assoc Prof Sim said that working beyond a certain threshold of hours may in fact increase errors and decrease one’s productivity. “Moreover, many studies have also consistently shown that poorer employee well-being is associated with increased disengagement and intentions to quit,\" he said, “A hyper-competitive corporate culture may also foster toxic work environments that ultimately undermines productivity.” As the push for flexible work arrangements gains momentum even as Singapore strives to maintain its competitive edge, both employers and employees will have their work cut out for them in navigating this new landscape. For a prospective employee, expressing a desire for greater work-life balance by way of flexible work arrangements — especially at the job interview stage — may work against the candidate, if the employer does not have such work arrangements in place, said Mr Suhaimi Salleh, chief executive officer of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group. At the same time, employers who do not offer such flexible work arrangements may also find themselves at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent, especially as workers’ expectations for work-life balance continue to evolve, he said. This is also a point that Manpower Minister Tan See Leng has made in explaining the rationale of flexible work arrangements. Ultimately, the transition towards fully embracing greater work-life balance — premised on a mindset of results-oriented work — will require cultural and mindset shifts, which would take time, said experts. Leading up to that, employers told TODAY that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition. Still, all these are worthy adjustments to be made. Mr Tulsiani of TZ APAC, said: “The lines between work and personal life are not as clear as it was before: Professionals today view their occupation as an important piece of a jigsaw puzzle that embodies their purpose in life. “It is one of the many priorities they devote their attention to, in addition to family, health, passion, service, charity, talent development and more. “Putting their employees’ purposes at the forefront of policy making will (thus) be key to retaining and attracting the best people, which is the lifeblood of any organisation.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For new mother Nur Sabrina Muhleseddin, being able to enjoy work-life balance is something she values in a job, as it allows her to be present for her son’s milestones. The 29-year-old digital marketing manager said her priorities have shifted since she gave birth in July last year. She was working in a different company previously, but had sought out a new role four months after becoming a mother. Being able to balance work with caring for her son is especially important to Ms Nur Sabrina, whose husband works in the hospitality industry as a shift manager — often having to work irregular hours and on weekends.

Right now, I just need a job so that I can provide food on the table and share the bills with my husband,” said Ms Nur Sabrina. Echoing her sentiments is 29-year-old Ms Chua, who works in a human resource software company. The marketing specialist, who declined to give her full name to prevent identification by her employer, started her career in a public relations agency which “didn’t provide for much work-life balance.” “I felt it was really tiring not only at work, but it also fed off my energy with my friends and family as well, and I didn’t have the capacity to do that.” As such, when she was looking for a new job, Ms Chua hunted specifically for roles that could give her the work-life balance she was seeking. Today, Ms Chua is employed by an Australian company, which allows her to perform her role 100 per cent remotely from Singapore. Ms Chua, who is married, said she is hoping to also start a family in the future, so having such flexibility is crucial to her. To her, being able to be present — not just at work, but also with her friends and family — is key to building an all-round holistic life, she added. The approach embraced by Ms Nur Sabrina and Ms Chua reflects a growing shift among Singapore workers towards prioritising work-life balance — with many recognising that work is not everything, along with a desire to also spend more time on personal pursuits. Alluding to this shift in a speech after being sworn in as Singapore’s fourth prime minister on Wednesday (May 15), Mr Lawrence Wong said: “They (younger Singaporeans) will strive and work hard for their goals, but they do not wish to be trapped in an endless rat race of hyper-competition. “They want a refreshed Singapore Dream — one that is not defined by material success alone, but also offers meaning and purpose in their careers and lives.” He added that the Government would thus find “new ways to be productive and innovative”, and to help a new generation of workers “achieve a better balance where work is purposeful, and life is meaningful”. One of the ways this is being explored is through flexible work options, which allow employees to carve out a suitable work-life rhythm tailored to their individual needs at different life stages. From December this year, all firms in Singapore will be required to have a formal process in place for their employees to request for flexible working arrangements . The release of the guidelines last month has also reignited debate on the issue of work-life balance and flexible work, which has long attracted polarising sentiments — even to the extent of some questioning whether Singapore workers have increasingly lost their hunger and drive. In the wake of the announcement, some employers had also come out to say that they may even rethink hiring local staff, and instead look overseas for recruitment . Speaking to TODAY, Mr Suhaimi Salleh, chief executive officer of consultancy and professional training firm SSA Group, said it is crucial to consider the “broader implications” of demanding better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements, especially in a globalised job market. “If local employees insist on full flexibility for roles that can be equally efficiently performed remotely by workers in lower-cost locations like Manila, they may inadvertently pit themselves against foreign talents who can accept lower salaries. “This scenario could potentially disadvantage local applicants, as the cost of employing a similarly qualified individual in Manila may be significantly lower than employing a Singaporean for the same role,” he added. The debate also begs the broader question: In resource-scarce Singapore, is it too much for employees to seek a better quality of life by way of better work-life balance? Or must its workforce — as the nation’s prime resource — remain in a perpetual state of being “kiasu” (Singlish for “scared to lose”), for fear of others stealing its rice bowl and Singapore’s labour force ultimately losing its competitive edge? Recent surveys have found a growing expectation among the Singapore workforce for greater work-life balance. A survey done by recruitment firm Randstad in 2023 found that more respondents are prioritising work-life balance over salary : Ninety-five per cent of Singapore workers said that having work-life balance is important to them in their current and future jobs, compared to 90 per cent who said pay is important. Human resource and sociology experts told TODAY that while the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated the demand for better work-life balance and flexible work as more employees recognise the feasibility of such arrangements, the growing expectation for work-life balance is ultimately not a new phenomenon. Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from National University of Singapore (NUS), said that even before working from home became a feature of the new post-pandemic work norm, there has been a “silent but significant value shift towards prioritising work autonomy and quality of life” — and, in turn, work-life balance — with Singapore becoming a more affluent, post-materialist society. Dr Shannon Ang, an assistant professor of sociology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), said that the contradictions of constantly prioritising economic growth over “life” also gradually get brought to the forefront, or become more acute, as societies develop. In the past, he noted, “we were told we needed to work hard, because Singapore’s place in the world should not be taken for granted, and that we could lose it all if we gave it less than our very best”. However, the slower economic growth Singapore sees today compared to the past could prompt a new generation of workers to feel like it is “less ‘worth it’ to keep pursuing economic growth”, as they do not enjoy the same extent of progress. “Older cohorts saw palpable change in their living conditions for the sacrifices that they made. Younger cohorts are unlikely to see the same kind of progress, and are probably quickly realising it may be better to invest their time in pursuits that seem more meaningful to them,” said Dr Ang. At the same time, experts also cautioned against the general tendency to assume that the desire for work-life balance is mainly confined to a younger generation of workers. Instead of couching it as an issue that later-born cohorts are “spoilt and cannot take hard work anymore”, Dr Ang suggested that work-life balance could have become more sought after in recent times due to other factors at play. For example, the growing number of dual-earner couples means that work-life balance may be harder to achieve because there is no longer one person in the family dedicated to doing the household tasks or providing childcare. As an ageing society, Singaporeans are also living longer. At the same time, shrinking family sizes mean care responsibilities are shared among fewer children, and more time may need to be devoted to caregiving or coordinating care for an older parent, said Dr Ang. These societal changes could have also prompted a greater cry for work-life balance over the years. Agreeing, Mr Richard Bradshaw, the Asia chief executive officer of recruitment consultancy Ethos BeathChapman, said better work-life balance has grown to be a “common requirement” across different working demographics and ages today, and to some extent, may even be perceived as a form of “basic workers’ rights”. This was something which resonated with 47-year-old father of three Edwin Ho. The senior associate director at Finexis Advisory, who wants to be actively involved in helping his three teenage children to navigate their life stages, said this consideration was among the factors that motivated him to switch from working as an engineer in the Republic of Singapore Air Force to his current career in personal finance. Being in the personal finance industry has allowed him the flexibility to work from home and also plan his own appointments with clients. “Ideally we would all like to have work-life balance, but we have different needs at different times. To find balance between work and personal life, we have to constantly make the necessary adjustments to make it happen,” Mr Ho said. Likewise, Ms Samantha Ong, 36, told TODAY that her approach towards work is to work harder while she is young, so she would be able to retire earlier. “When I had children, I shifted my priorities. I need to work hard for my family — providing financial security yet at the same time spending quality time with the children when they are young,” said Ms Ong. The marketing campaign manager at technology firm Telstra International has two young children aged two and four years old. “It requires a delicate balance, smart planning and often a good support system,” she added. “You have to accept that there is no ‘perfect’ work-life balance — it’s more important to strive for a realistic schedule instead of a perfect one. Some days, I might focus more on work, while on other days I spend more time and energy on hobbies like working out or being with loved ones.” With more people yearning for better work-life balance, the million-dollar question is whether, from employers’ point of view, it is too much to ask for. While they understand the desire for better work-life balance and integration, some employers, especially those in the services industries, told TODAY that it is difficult to accede to employees’ requests, given the nature of their role and industry. Generational gaps may also play a part in influencing the success of flexible work arrangements. Mr Jianhan Qiu, principal for strategy and change in Asia at strategy, design, and construction firm Unispace Singapore, said that younger Gen Zers may be more accustomed to operating virtually compared to their older colleagues. “This generational gap influences managerial approaches to hybrid meetings and mentorship which might contradict flexible work arrangements. Managers who favour face-to-face interactions may inadvertently pressure remote employees to be in the office more to avoid missing out on career development opportunities.” Additionally, some roles and industries may be better suited to flexible work that could afford its employees better work-life balance, simply due to their nature of work. Mr Kenji Naito, group chief executive officer at recruitment agency Reeracoen, said that sectors such as technology, or creative and professional services, tend to demonstrate greater openness to flexible work. Conversely, industries with stringent operational requirements or client-facing roles may find it more challenging to implement such arrangements, he said. Mr Salim Radiman, a business development manager and assistant general manager at a cleaning services company, said: “It is quite difficult for us to have that flexible work environment, because...we have to provide manpower to ensure that daily operations are being deployed according to the (client’s) contract.” He added that Singaporeans tend to shun work in the cleaning as well as food industries because of its long hours and the need to work on public holidays and weekends. “That’s why in my kind of industry, we have to hire Chinese workers, Malaysian workers, Myanmar workers, and Filipino workers. For them, they come to Singapore and their mindset is to work and earn a living for their family, so their commitment is different from the locals.” Asked about these concerns of employers who may rethink hiring local staff and instead look overseas for recruitment, particularly given the difference in costs, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said last month that the competitiveness of Singapore’s workforce was key. Local workers must have in-demand skills and be able to meet business productivity needs. They must also remain competitive in their work ethic or “the softer things, like being reliable, trusted”, which are attributes of the local workforce that businesses appreciate, she said. Speaking in Parliament earlier this month, she also reiterated that remote work and outsourcing are already global trends regardless of Singapore’s guidelines. “Even if foreigners are not working in Singapore... they will still be competing with us when working in companies overseas.” Instead, it was more important for local workers to continually upskill and stay productive to compete for jobs not just in Singapore, but globally, she added. Does this mean, however, that Singapore workers need to work hard over long hours to retain their competitive edge? Not so, said the experts interviewed, who pointed out that competitiveness is multi-faceted, and prioritising work-life balance does not have to come at the expense of a workforce’s attractiveness or economic progress. In 2022, the BBC reported that Norway and Denmark had work weeks that were shorter than 40 hours, yet were respectively the second- and seventh-most productive countries in the world then. For one thing, what workers may lose out on in absolute hours put into work can be made up for in other ways, such as increased productivity during the actual time they are at their jobs. Associate Professor Nicholas Sim, from the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ (SUSS) School of Business, said: “While there are trade-offs between competitiveness and work-life balance, it is not necessarily true that work-life balance must be sacrificed to increase competitiveness, particularly if this refers to an increase in productivity.” He added that the assumption that one must work longer hours to be more competitive is often “unfounded”. Highlighting findings from studies which surveyed respondents of various occupations and skill levels, Assoc Prof Sim said that working beyond a certain threshold of hours may in fact increase errors and decrease one’s productivity. “Moreover, many studies have also consistently shown that poorer employee well-being is associated with increased disengagement and intentions to quit. “A hyper-competitive corporate culture may also foster toxic work environments that ultimately undermines productivity.” Agreeing, Dr Kelvin Seah, an economist at NUS, said that what is more important is to assess not only the quantity, but also the quality of time spent at work. To this end, having greater work-life balance may actually improve one’s output. “If employees feel happier and less stressed at work, they may be able to think of better ideas, be more efficient and engaged at work, and perform better at their jobs,” he added. Agreeing, Ms Cassandra Loh, vice-president of partnerships and solutions at mental health start-up Intellect, said she believes companies should instead be more “results-oriented”. She also does not believe that having work-life balance is necessarily in conflict with also working hard. “I always believe that if one has ownership and takes pride in their work, whatever the work might be, work will still get done (within) deadlines.” Work-life balance or flexibility just helps the worker schedule their day better, she added. For Ms Loh, who is a mother to two young children aged one-and-a-half and five years old, this could look like trying to be home by 7pm to spend time with her kids, before returning to focus on her work at 10pm after they go to sleep. Other employees TODAY spoke to also disagree with the notion that those who yearn for work-life balance are less hungry for success. Mr Ho from Finexis Advisory said that a person who devotes equal amounts of time to work and personal life can be more successful, productive and fulfilling, than a person who only works hard and spends huge amounts of time at work while sacrificing other matters in life, like spending time with family and friends or travelling. “To me, working hard and being successful does not mean simply attaining some professional or work-related goals. It means putting in quality effort to learn from experiences every day...and using less time to achieve one ’s targets and goals. “I think we first must define (our) purpose for working hard and what success is, so that we can work towards that goal and in doing so, learn to find a balance between work and personal life.” Agreeing, Mr Jivan Tulsiani, the head of marketing at blockchain firm TZ APAC, said that a growing demand for work-life balance does not reflect a lack of hunger from employees. “It's more of a shift in how ambitious professionals define success. It's important to understand the concept of purpose, which is an aggregate of components such as talent, passion, skills, occupation, charity and service,” he said. “Professionals are able to satisfy some of these components in their jobs, but are also willing to make time for other priorities outside of work to fulfil their purposes.” Mr Tulsiani has observed that newer generations of workers are “very intentional about their passions”. Some employers who recognise the need to afford their employees greater work-life harmony say that they have such employees who are high achievers. Mr Winthrop Wong, co-founder and pharmacist at e-pharmacy Glovida-Rx, said this is the case of some of its medical sales staff. “We set them qualitative and quantitative goals on a yearly and monthly basis and if they are able to achieve these targets, we basically allow them to schedule their days in what is most productive to them.” Experts interviewed by TODAY also pointed out that offering greater work-life balance and flexible work arrangements could even attract additional groups of workers — who are otherwise unable to contribute to the workforce if they had to adhere strictly to traditional work settings and hours — into the market. Dr Ang from NTU said: “We tend to focus on the people who are currently working, and act as if they are trying to skive off by asking for more work-life balance. “What we probably miss, are the people for whom a better work-life balance will allow (them) to work, for those whom it will allow to work longer or more sustainably (such as older persons, or those with health conditions), and so on. “Much depends on whether employers are creative enough to tap such people by adapting their own processes or (possibly outmoded) ways of thinking.” Amid a push for better work-life balance and flexible work arrangements even as Singapore strives to maintain its competitive edge, both employers and employees will have their work cut out for them in navigating this new landscape. For a prospective employee, expressing a desire for greater work-life balance by way of flexible work arrangements — especially at the job interview stage — may work against the candidate, if the employer does not have such work arrangements in place, said Mr Suhaimi of SSA Group. At the same time, employers who do not offer such flexible work arrangements may also find themselves at a disadvantage in attracting and retaining talent, especially as workers’ expectations for work-life balance continue to evolve, he said. This is also a point that Manpower Minister Tan See Leng has made in explaining the rationale of flexible work arrangements. With corporate information on pay, benefits, and culture becoming more transparent and widely available across prospective employers and employees, Mr Qiu from Unispace Singapore said that companies will need to adapt to attract and retain talent. Over time, this would leave the organisations’ approach towards work-life balance and flexible work to be the main differentiator. While employers interviewed by TODAY acknowledged the benefits greater work-life balance had on employee engagement, talent attraction and retention, they also raised concerns. One challenge flagged by several employers includes the difficulty of monitoring employees’ productivity and performance when they work remotely or are operating on flexible schedules. Other concerns include potential impacts on business operations and stakeholder relationships, ensuring fair team workload distribution, and any associated costs, said Ms Khew Shu Ping, deputy managing director of public relations agency Tate Anzur. Asked what an optimal balance to strike between work-life balance and an economy’s performance could look like in Singapore’s context, Dr Ang from NTU said this balance would differ for each person at each stage of life. “This means we will need to create room for people to strike these different balances without feeling like they cannot survive.” To do this necessitates a mindset shift from being a “market society” — driven by economic logic on who is worthy of respect and what is worth striving for — to that of a “market economy”, where the economy is simply a tool for exchange and society decides what it values and how to thus make the market work for it, said Dr Ang. Ultimately, the transition towards fully embracing greater work-life balance — premised on a mindset of results-oriented work — will require cultural and mindset shifts, which would take time, said experts. Citing studies on how culture tends to be highly persistent, Assoc Prof Sim from SUSS said that it is very unlikely for there to be an organic shift towards a culture of measuring performance by output, unless there are some external macroeconomic or policy shocks, similar to Covid-19. Notwithstanding that, employers told TODAY that building a culture of mutual trust and open communication with their employees would be key to a smooth transition and moving the needle. For one thing, employees are encouraged to clearly define their needs and the specific type of flexible work arrangement they’re seeking, said Ms Khew from Tate Anzur. “As part of their application, they can submit a well-defined plan outlining how their flexible work arrangement will be implemented,” she added. This plan should address how their workload will be covered during their absence, how they will stay connected and maintain proactive communication, and their commitment to continually deliver high-quality work. These go a long way in showing that employees can manage the responsibility of flexi-work arrangements, said Mr Danny Tan, managing director of public relations agency Grayling Singapore. Other ways this is evident are in areas such as employees’ timeliness — as seen from their punctuality for work and in keeping to deadlines — and their overall performance at work. “If they have performance issues, it is unlikely that they will be considered for flexi-work arrangements,” said Mr Tan. The agency currently operates on a 4.5-day work week that is extended to all employees who have spent more than a year with the firm. Agreeing, Mr Wong from Glovida-Rx said employers will be more likely to accede to requests for better work-life balance or flexi-work arrangements from workers with a good track record. “We build a culture of trust over a period of time.” Beyond building trust between employers and employees, Mr Wong said it is important to also foster a good working culture among employees themselves. Offering select employees flexi-work options and better work-life balance takes “great communication” from the employer — in that the company’s management must be clear on the parameters not only with the employees involved, but also with their team about why the arrangements are in place. Communicating clearly, and being open to questions, will thus help prevent any feelings of resentment between team members or concerns that there is some bias in an organisation, he added. Still, these are all worthy adjustments to be made as employers and employees alike navigate what could be the next new normal. Mr Tulsiani of TZ APAC said: “The lines between work and personal life are not as clear as it was before: Professionals today view their occupation as an important piece of a jigsaw puzzle that embodies their purpose in life. “It is one of the many priorities they devote their attention to, in addition to family, health, passion, service, charity, talent development and more. “Putting their employees’ purposes at the forefront of policy making will (thus) be key to retaining and attracting the best people, which is the lifeblood of any organisation.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read Visitors at the sales gallery of Quayside JBCC, a development located in Johor Bahru City Centre on May 15, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at why some Singaporeans snap up properties in Johor and how their purchases have panned out. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — Lots of sharply contrasting stories swirl around the topic of Johor property. There are those like 27-year-old Kylie Hung, who moved into a three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru seven months ago and is enjoying access to features such as a pool, butler service and a private beach. She currently pays about RM3,500 (S$1,000) a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees on her Country Garden Danga Bay condominium, and is happy with her purchase. But then there are those with regrets, such as Mr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014 as investments. Prospects might have looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), but things subsequently went downhill. The onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar. Mr Sim finally sold both units this year, incurring a loss of RM500,000. “It was the worst investment of my life,” he said. In addition to such anecdotes is a constant flow of news, both good and bad, about infrastructure and business developments in Johor. What is a prospective Singaporean buyer meant to make of it all? TODAY takes a closer look. Iskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore. Some of the major cities in Iskandar include Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia. The launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state. Until recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border. Launched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green, and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035. Despite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia. In December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. Notwithstanding the several stumbling blocks over the years, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans. In January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar — where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located — after a commemorative ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. But real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north. Six property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home. Experiences vary widely among those who have taken the plunge, which has made it difficult for some to decipher whether Johor property is a good investment. Operations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among those with no regrets. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, which they now call home. Mr Lee said there have been promising improvements with regard to traffic on the Causeway, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates. But some who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago did not see their investments bear fruit. A supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property in 2014: An RM1.7 million double-story cluster house in Horizon Hills. “I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,” said the 40-year-old. However, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City “killed the property market”. “There’s an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,” said Mr Lee. All things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision. Mr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research. “If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply – not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more. “If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,” he said, referring to Forest City. Mr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean. “When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,” he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase. When investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul also advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects. “Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won’t be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Living in her newly bought three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru, Kylie Hung, 27, enjoys all the perks of homeownership as a singleton before hitting 30 — something she is unable to do back in Singapore. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Living in her newly bought three-bedroom condominium in Johor Bahru, Kylie Hung, 27, enjoys all the perks of homeownership as a singleton before hitting 30 — something she is unable to do back in Singapore. And her work as a digital entrepreneur allows her to have total control of her time, which means she does not need to contend with the congestion at the Causeway during peak hours. Ms Hung moved into her Country Garden Danga Bay condominium seven months ago, where she has access to features such as a pool, butler service and a private beach. Ms Hung said she had wanted to move out of her parents' house as she needed her own quiet space, which she felt would help her better focus at work. But private property in Singapore was out of her reach, and she could not buy a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat as the minimum age eligibility for singles is 35. “If I were to rent a place in Singapore alone, the money would go out of my pocket to something that I don’t own,\" she said. “So I looked at Johor Bahru properties and thought that it made better sense for me to buy. My monthly mortgage would be around the same price as renting a room back home.\" Ms Hung took out a bank loan to finance her 1,237 sq ft abode, which cost around RM700,000 (S$200,000). She currently pays about RM3,500 (S$1,000) a month for the mortgage and maintenance fees. While she's happy with her purchase, she acknowledged that moving to Johor Bahru works for her because of her job’s flexibility, and it might not be for everyone. “For those working 9am to 6pm, I wouldn’t recommend it because the jam on the Causeway can be quite bad.” Even so, buying property in Johor was all the hype among Singaporeans about a decade ago, when Iskandar Malaysia, the main southern economic corridor in Johor, opened for business. The draw for those Singaporeans was much the same as for Ms Hung: The ability to own and live in a luxury home at a much lower price than its equivalent in Singapore. Since then, TODAY has found that there are those who are pleased they made the leap and those who regret it. Mr Eric Sim, who bought two four-bedroom units of 2,400 sq ft each near JB Sentral in 2014, said the investment had left a bad taste in his mouth until today. Each unit of four bedrooms and six bathrooms was financed with a bank loan after a 10 per cent down payment. Although prospects looked good then, driven by economic development and mega infrastructure projects such as the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (HSR), things subsequently went downhill. “I bought them as an investment because I thought (Iskandar) would be the next Shenzhen. But it was just an illusion,” the 54-year-old career book author lamented. “I realised after buying that there were no big companies in Johor Bahru, whereas, in Shenzhen, there are Tencent, Huawei, and Shenzhen Airlines. So, there won’t be any high-salary talent attraction to support the high property prices.” Three more factors threw Mr Sim’s plans out of kilter: The onslaught of new projects raised supply above demand, the 2018 Malaysian general election culminated in a change in government and policies, such as the cancellation of the HSR project and lastly, the ringgit continued to weaken against the Singapore dollar. When he invested in his properties in 2014, S$1 was about RM2.60. In February this year, the Singapore dollar rose to a record high of RM3.55. Mr Sim found it difficult to rent out his properties. Even if he had found tenants, the rental would not have been enough to cover his monthly upkeep due to the exchange rate, he said. He finally sold both units this year, at a loss. His total investment cost him a little over RM3 million, but he incurred a loss of RM500,000. “It was the worst investment of my life,” Mr Sim said. Even so, interest in Johor homes remains high among Singaporeans. In January, for example, there was some hype over properties near Bukit Chagar — where the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link station is located — after a commemorative ceremony attended by then-Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. But real estate experts told TODAY that rising inflation and property prices at home are the more important reasons driving Singaporean homebuyers up north. The RTS Link is slated to start passenger service by the end of 2026. Once operational, it is expected to ease bottlenecks on the Causeway, allowing easier access across the border. The consistent demand, not just from Singaporeans but investors worldwide too, has buoyed property prices in Johor, which have risen threefold since 2010, according to data from Malaysia’s National Property Information Centre (Napic). But other news events paint a less rosy picture of the Johor property market. Last year, Forest City, the flagship US$100 billion (S$135 billion) mega-project by Chinese developer Country Garden, was dubbed a “ghost town” by the media as the housing estates there were reportedly largely unoccupied. Some buyers, including Singaporeans, were cited by international news outlets expressing disappointment and regret over their investments. A handful said they were fortunate to have sold off their units before the situation took a turn for the worse. In 2022, over at Country Garden Danga Bay, disgruntled owners from Singapore, Malaysia, and China filed a class-action lawsuit against the developer, alleging that the developer's luxury condominium was not delivered as advertised. So, for potential investors or homeowners mulling whether to leap into the Johor property market, it can be quite difficult to figure out what the wise decision would be. TODAY examines the reasons behind the current influx of Singaporean buyers in Johor, what they look for in a Johor property and the key things one should consider before putting money down on a house across the border. When Singaporeans think of Johor, it is typically the Johor Bahru area that comes to mind, but in fact, the state government’s plans to drive Johor’s economic growth extend beyond the city centre. Iskandar Malaysia comprises the Johor Bahru District, Kulai District and part of the Pontian District. Officially launched in 2006, it encompasses an area of 2,217 sq km, nearly three times the size of Singapore. Some of the major cities in Iskandar include Johor Bahru city centre, Iskandar Puteri (where Legoland is) and Pasir Gudang, one of the largest industrial areas in Malaysia. The launch of Iskandar was aimed at attracting international investments that would drive economic growth for the state. And within Iskandar is the township development of Medini, envisioned as Iskandar Puteri’s central business district (CBD). Here, there are no restrictions on foreign homeownership. Generally, foreigners buying properties in Johor must adhere to a minimum purchase price of RM1 million. However, exemptions are granted to certain projects, especially if they were approved before the threshold was implemented on May 1, 2014. Until recently, the piece de resistance of Iskandar was supposed to be Forest City, a colossal luxury real estate project on four man-made islands in the Johor Strait, overlooking the Singapore border. Launched in 2013, Forest City was envisioned as a futuristic, green, and smart city. It is Chinese developer Country Garden's largest overseas project, and was planned to house 700,000 people by 2035. Despite its ambitious vision, the project encountered several challenges and controversies due to a mix of low sales, Chinese restrictions on capital outflows, border closures during the pandemic and public backlash against China's increasing influence in Malaysia. Last August, the developer said the project was proceeding as planned despite issues involving \"political landscape and interference, economic stability, government policy\". In December 2023, CNA reported that only 15 per cent of the entire project had been completed. According to the developer, a total of 28,000 residential units have been completed, with 80 per cent of these units sold to buyers from over 30 countries. Around 9,000 residents are said to live in Forest City. TODAY has reached out to Country Garden for the latest figures. In an attempt to spur economic development and attract investors, Forest City was announced as a Special Financial Zone (SFZ) last August. With this designation, businesses are offered incentives to set up operations here, such as a flat income tax rate of 15 per cent instead of the usual 30 per cent, for skilled foreign workers. In preparation for the SFZ designation, Country Garden is building a new Customs checkpoint, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It also announced that several transportation-related infrastructure projects within the massive enclave are in progress. Some international media outlets reported in April that talks were being held on opening a casino in Forest City, citing unnamed sources. But Prime Minister Anwar was quick to squash all talk with an “affirmative no” to the idea. Despite the negative news around Forest City, the relaunch of the RTS Link project by Singapore and Malaysia may have renewed Singaporeans’ interest in owning property across the border. Mr Tan Kin Lian, a two-time presidential candidate, is among those who have long appreciated the merits of owning a second home there. In 2018, he purchased a 1,100 sq ft three-bedroom unit in Forest City for about RM1.6 million, paid fully in cash. He makes the 2.5-hour journey across Tuas Second Link by public transport twice or thrice a month and stays there three days each time. When this TODAY reporter met the 76-year-old at his Johor abode on May 18, a Saturday, he seemed very much at home. He said he enjoys the peace and tranquillity, as well as the unblocked view of Johor’s greenery from his balcony. For a place where supposedly 9,000 residents are staying, this reporter found it unusually quiet for a weekend. On Mr Tan’s floor, where there are eight units, he said only his was occupied. As this TODAY reporter travelled across the vast expanse of Forest City via an hourly shuttle bus, only one other passenger boarded it. There were some signs of life at Forest City’s transport hub, though, where one can find a good mix of restaurants, retail shops, and a convenience mart open for business. Still, some shop lots were either closed or boarded up, awaiting prospective tenants. Notwithstanding the controversies and rather muted environment, Mr Tan said he is happy with his decision to buy a Forest City unit as he believes in the project’s potential. He also found himself drawn to the “modern city design”. Forest City also appeals to Malaysian workers who work in Singapore, as rental prices are reasonable. Among its residents is Mr Afiq Alwi, a 40-year-old truck driver who is currently renting a 600 sq ft unit with two bedrooms for RM1,000. He said that the rate at Forest City was cheaper compared with units for rent in nearby towns in Iskandar Puteri, such as Gelang Patah: “For the same unit, I’d be paying RM1,600 there.” “I like working in Singapore, but it’s expensive to live there because one room can cost minimally S$700 to S$800. For less than that price in ringgit, I can comfortably rent an entire unit all to myself here.” Six property agents TODAY spoke to said that while a significant number of Singaporeans are looking to buy Johor homes for investment, there are also those looking to live there or have a second home. Operations director Victor Lee, 53, and his wife Crystal Wang, 38, are among the latter. When TODAY met the couple on May 15, they had just collected the keys to their two-bedroom unit at R&F Princess Cove, a condominium project said to be popular among Singaporean buyers. Mr Lee said they paid for the RM800,000, 834 sq ft unit in full, using cash. Thanks to a flexi-work arrangement — he can spend one or two days working from home each week — Mr Lee, who is in the energy sector, said he is happy with the purchase. “R&F is near my workplace in Admiralty West. You can see it from my balcony. So geographically, I’m at an advantage,” he said. Asked if he would brave the notorious congestion on the Causeway several times a week, Mr Lee said there have been promising improvements, with both governments constantly making efforts to smoothen the travel process, such as the recent implementation of electronic gates. “There are pros and cons. If you live in Singapore, the major expressways are always jammed, and there’s ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) to consider. It’s a trade-off I can live with.” Before buying this Johor house, the couple had been renting a studio unit in Singapore for S$2,000 monthly. Mr Lee also owns an HDB flat where his parents live. “We decided to look to JB and thought, instead of renting, why don’t we put our money into a place we can call our own?” he said. On safety concerns in Johor Bahru, Mr Lee said he would do his best to take precautions, such as avoiding going out alone at night and in dark alleyways. A Singaporean father of two, who wanted to be known only as Mr Afiq for privacy reasons (not to be confused with Mr Afiq Alwi above), is looking to buy a property in Johor within the next 12 months. For the last six months, he has been renting a 1,500 sq ft double-storey terrace house in Horizon Hills, Iskandar Puteri, with his wife and two kids, aged six and nine, for RM3,500 a month, and he likes the lifestyle there. Mr Afiq, who works in finance, said before moving there, he had been entertaining the thought of relocating to Johor as he can work remotely most of the time. It was when his wife decided to quit her job as an agricultural scientist to recover from burnout that he mooted the idea and she agreed. “One main reason that pushed me to move my family here was so that I could send my kids to an international school, where they get to learn Chinese as a required subject and socialise in a melting pot of different nationalities,” he said. The difference in cost of living was another push factor, as Mr Afiq is currently spending S$20,000 a year on his kids’ education. If he were to do the same in Singapore, he estimated that he would easily be paying twice or thrice that amount. “At this point, I can confidently say that we plan to move to Johor for the long term. Unless there are big regulatory changes, we'll probably live in Johor for the next two to five years.” Regarding security, Mr Afiq said every city or state has different security standards in different areas, and the same goes for Johor. “I know from my Malaysian friends that certain areas in Johor are considerably poorer, where the likelihood of you being robbed or your car being broken into is quite high. “But that’s why staying in a gated community helps. My family and I are also not flashy people. I own a cheap entry-level local car so that we can get around easily. We try to avoid unsafe areas.” In contrast to those who bought the apartments to live in, the picture is less rosy for investors including those who entered the Johor property market 10 years ago. A supply chain manager who wished to be known only as Mr Lee invested in a property the same year as Mr Sim, the author who sold off his units at a loss. Mr Lee bought an RM1.7 million double-story cluster house in Horizon Hills. The 2,514 sq ft house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms, and he financed the purchase with a bank loan. “The Johor property market was booming, so my friends also bought properties in Johor as investments. I expected to be able to sell my house within five years and make a profit due to capital appreciation,” said the 40-year-old. However, things did not go as planned. In his view, the launch of Forest City “killed the property market”. “There’s an oversupply of units because of the project. We did not expect the developers from China to come in that fast. If I were to sell now, I would be looking at a loss,” said Mr Lee. “I kind of regret buying the property because I could have put the money to better use. If given a choice, I wouldn’t have done it.” Mr Lee told TODAY that he is still holding onto his unit. He hopes the newly announced plans, such as the Singapore-Johor Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and RTS Link, would eventually drive up demand and prices. Mr Sim said most buyers, like himself, tend to get caught up in thinking that buying property in Johor is lucrative simply because “the psf (price per square foot) is so cheap... cheaper than HDB.” But he said there are other factors to consider. For example, in Singapore condominiums, units typically require “some curtains and lights” before being deemed viable for rental, he noted. “But in Malaysia, it’s not like that. You need to do up the cabinet and kitchen, not just curtains and lights. So, with everything considered, I would need to spend about RM80,000 for my units just to get them in good condition before renting them out. “So I thought I might as well not rent them out because it would jeopardise my chances of selling the units off eventually,” he said. Despite stories like Mr Lee's and Mr Sim's, overall demand for Johor property has stayed strong. Data from Malaysia’s Napic shows that the property price index for Johor state, which was given a value of 100 in the base year of 2010, soared to 313.3 in 2023, which means prices more than tripled on average. The increase is more drastic for Johor Bahru, as the price index stands at 400 in 2023, from the same base year value of 100. In Singapore, based on the Urban Redevelopment Authority Realis data, the property price index climbed from 125.1 in the first quarter of 2010 to 204 in the first quarter of this year, a 63 per cent increase. Meanwhile, PropertyGuru Singapore country manager Dr Tan Tee Khoon said that as of April this year, demand for residential homes in Johor Bahru recorded an increase of “close to three times” since October 2019. This is based on the firm’s \"demand index\", which calculates the number of visitors to property listings, weighted by their engagement and search behaviour. The demand index for residential homes for rent in Johor Bahru also experienced a significant jump after the reopening of the Johor-Singapore border in February 2022, he said, and since then, rental demand has remained largely stable. Using asking prices for service residences as a proxy for price movement, the median psf was RM488.75 as of April 2024, up from RM397.35 in March 2022, he said, adding that this was also higher than the pre-Covid median price of RM449.07 psf. “Notably, nearly 44 per cent of property seekers looking for a residential property in Johor Bahru in April 2024 were from Singapore.” Dr Tan cited several reasons that contributed to this, such as the full reopening of the Republic’s international borders on April 1, 2022, which significantly boosted the demand for homes in Johor Bahru, particularly among Malaysians working in Singapore. “High rents and a strong Singaporean currency make owning a home in Johor Bahru more attractive. Additionally, the announcement of the SEZ and RTS further drove up rental prices.” Mr Faizul Ridzuan, chief executive officer of property investment firm Far Capital, agreed. “In Singapore, property values have gone up by 30 to 40 per cent in 24 months. After Covid, rentals have gone up by 60 per cent,” he told TODAY. “There’s nothing new or sexy about Johor. It’s been like this for years. This time around, the primary push factors are coming from Singapore, as the cost of living has gone up substantially in the last 12 to 24 months, forcing people to look for cheaper alternatives, along with the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit against SGD.” Real estate negotiator Edward Lee said Singapore’s housing policies, which levy a higher stamp duty on second and subsequent properties, also contributed to the increase in demand. “Once the RTS is completed, I believe property prices will be even higher than today,” he added. The hot Johor property market has led some to wonder whether there would be any spillover effect on the prices of HDB flats at housing estates near the Woodlands Checkpoint, like Woodlands town itself. But Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at PropNex Realty, said she believes that the HDB prices and rental trends in Woodlands generally align with overall market movement in Singapore, rather than specific locational attributes. “That said, transaction activity, particularly HDB resale and rental activity, has been gaining some traction recently for Woodlands town,” she said. The HDB resale volume in Woodlands has seen a year-on-year increase since 2021. In 2022, there was a year-on-year increase of 14.2 per cent, while 2023 recorded a 10 per cent jump. Ms Wong said that this can be attributed to overall improvements in infrastructure and ongoing efforts to transform the estate into a commercial hub, which has helped boost the quality of life and employment opportunities within the area. “The recent opening of the Thomson-East Coast Line has also greatly improved connectivity... Proximity to well-established amenities such as schools, malls, and the Causeway are all perks that further boost its popularity among residents.” All things considered, is investing in a property in Johor a worthwhile investment? Property experts and homeowners advise prospective buyers to do their homework thoroughly before making a decision. Mr Sim, the former investment banker, said one should refrain from following investment trends without research. “If I could turn back time, I would do a little more research on the economic activities in the area. I would also check the housing supply – not the number of units available at that point in time, but the amount of land and whether property developers would build more. “If I had done my homework back in 2014, I would've found information that other developers had plans to go big,” he said, referring to Forest City. Real estate agent Ryan Khoo, who deals with properties in Johor, said it's a good idea to look into the developer’s background before making a purchase. “Look for reputable ones that are publicly listed and have solid track records. For example, they have built existing projects in Johor or other parts of Malaysia that you can visit.” Mr Faizul of Far Capital stressed the importance of looking at a property in Malaysia through the lens of a local, instead of a Singaporean. “When you use a Singaporean mindset to buy a property in Johor, it's suicidal,” he said, since the buyer may end up overpaying for their purchase. Illustrating his point, Mr Faizul said the average property price in Johor 10 years ago, including high-rise and landed units, was about RM300,000. “When Singaporeans come in, they pay way more than that. Perhaps over RM500,000 to RM1 million, whereas the average local only pays RM300,000. When you overpay, the probability of profit will be greatly reduced.” When investing based on the potential of future infrastructure and amenities, Mr Faizul advised prospective buyers to be patient and only make the move when there is concrete movement for the projects. “Like the RTS, when you see movements from both governments, then you know for sure it won’t be cancelled. (Wait until things are) built first, instead of investing during the talking stage. “I’ll give you an analogy. You commit to someone who is serious about you. Just because your friend comes and tells you about this person who is ideal, rich, and good-looking, it doesn’t mean you stop doing your due diligence, and marry the person straight away, right?” CORRECTION : An earlier version of this article said that Dr Tan Tee Khoon was the country manager of PropertyGuru Malaysia.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — For a young Sukesy Mattar, studying at an international school in Kuwait, where she lived with her family till she was 11, provided her with a vibrant, holistic experience. Mrs Gwyneth Nyoto teaching her sons at home in their study corner. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For a young Sukesy Mattar, studying at an international school in Kuwait, where she lived with her family till she was 11, provided her with a vibrant, holistic experience. “We studied lots of different things, like handwriting and poetry. PE (physical education) wasn’t just PE, it was gymnastics. Music and drama were also all part of the curriculum. And I didn't have to take any major exams, so the focus was never exams,” recalled the now 45-year-old mother of five. Her father had relocated the family to the country for work purposes. When she returned to Singapore, Ms Mattar’s transition back to the local education system where she was placed in Primary 6, was jarring. The curriculum, centred on the four academic subjects of English, maths, science and mother tongue and with a relentless focus on examinations, felt suffocating for her. Art and creative subjects were sidelined, and even PE was rigorously tested. When her oldest son completed his first year of kindergarten in 2007, Ms Mattar, who worked as a private tutor and continues to teach homeschooled children math and science today, began to reflect on her own experience in the mainstream school system. She found herself unsatisfied with the schooling options for her son, including international schools, which were too costly. Eventually, she took a leap of faith and homeschooled her son until he was 16. Having enjoyed the lifestyle that homeschooling afforded both her son and herself, Ms Mattar continued to homeschool her second and third children until they were 16. After completing their O-Level examinations, her first and third children went on to study at mainstream junior colleges, while her second child enrolled in a polytechnic. Her fourth child is currently homeschooled at the secondary level and her youngest attends a special education school. Treading a similar path, Ms Anju Tupili took her oldest son out of his mainstream school 14 years ago when he was in Primary 2 due to the “exhaustion” she saw in him. A particular incident tilted the scales in favour of homeschooling for Ms Tupili, who had left her career as an architect after the birth of her first child. On her wedding anniversary, she and her husband rushed to pick up the boy from school, and he had to change his clothes in the car on the way to the dinner venue. After dinner, a juggler was performing a street show, but the need for the boy to get up early for school the next day left the family with no time to stop and watch the act. “I felt like I had robbed him of the opportunity to just go with the flow in life. It was just too much,” the 50-year-old mother of three said. “And a few incidents like that happened and I felt that there was no life at such a young age. That was very sad.” As for Raymond and Diane Lim, they chose to follow a Christian curriculum along with the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) syllabus for their two children's education. Their son, Timothy, eight, has been homeschooled since he was three, while his younger sister, Mikayla, four, is currently receiving early education at home. The Lims follow a curriculum called Classical Conversations which emphasises memorisation, critical thinking and articulation skills while incorporating a Christian worldview into its course. “I prefer for his learning to be more about the wonders of God's creation,” said Mrs Lim, 44. “Not just for the sake of passing (exams), not so much that it has to be aligned with MOE, (but) we also learn about God’s work, art, science, we learn about Singapore maths as well.” Mr Lim, 47, runs an insurance and sales consultancy firm, while Mrs Lim worked as an insurance agent before becoming a full-time homemaker after her son was born. Ms Mattar, Ms Tupili and the Lims are part of a small group of parents in Singapore who choose to homeschool their children. MOE has long emphasised that Singaporean children should attend national primary schools so that they can acquire a common set of knowledge and skills, which will provide a strong foundation for further education and training. “This also gives our children a common educational experience, which builds national identity and social cohesion,” the ministry said in response to TODAY's queries. Since the Compulsory Education Act came into effect in 2003, the number of homeschooled children has “remained small and generally constant, at an average of about 50 Singaporean children for each primary age cohort every year”, said MOE. The Act makes it mandatory for all Singaporean children residing in the country, who are above six years old and under 15, to attend a national primary school unless an exemption is granted. MOE does not track the number of Singaporean children who are homeschooled at the secondary level and higher as they do not come under the Act’s purview. But the ministry said that this number is likely to be fewer than that for primary school for each cohort, as many homeschooled children do eventually enrol in mainstream primary schools or secondary schools. Associate Professor Jason Tan from the National Institute of Education (NIE) noted that the homeschool community is \"rather scattered” as there is no umbrella body to which all homeschooling families belong that would be able to provide concrete numbers on its size. “It is pretty much up to each parent to decide to link up with other homeschooling parents to engage in joint learning activities, or if they would prefer to do it alone,” he said. One common reason why some parents homeschool their children is to better meet their child's learning and developmental needs through one-to-one attention, he said. Associate Professor of Sociology Kamaludeen Mohamed Nasir, from Nanyang Technological University, said that homeschooling parents have chosen to “take ownership” of managing their children's education instead of relying on the mainstream system. \"These parents’ decisions to homeschool are driven by values they deem important, such as a well-rounded education, which they prioritise over other factors like capital accumulation or other externally imposed objectives and notions of success” he said. On whether the number of homeschoolers might rise in the future, Dr Ho Boon Tiong, principal consultant educationist at training and consulting firm ClassPoint Consulting, said that he does not foresee a significant increase due to the high level of commitment required of the homeschooling parent and the financial costs involved. Internationally, homeschooling is thriving in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. In the US, the number of homeschooled students rose from 2.5 million in 2019 to 3.1 million in 2021, corresponding to about 6 per cent of school-age children in the country, according to the National Home Education Research Institute. In the UK, the Department of Education estimated that 97,600 children, or 1 per cent of school-age children in the country were homeschooled in the summer of 2023, up from 86,000 children at the start of last year, or just within several months. Australia had 21,437 registered homeschoolers in 2019, or 0.5 per cent of the total school population, according to a 2021 survey by the Home School Legal Defense Association. In Singapore, each homeschooling application is reviewed on a case-by-case basis by MOE to ensure that the children's educational development is safeguarded. The ministry does not provide a recommended curriculum for parents who wish to homeschool their children. In Mrs Gwyneth Nyoto’s case, she called the MOE's Compulsory Education Unit to indicate her intention to homeschool her oldest child Lukas, who is now 10. The 39-year-old previously worked at a non-profit organisation before she took on homeschooling responsibilities. MOE told her to send an email stating her child’s age, proof of citizenship and indication to homeschool, before having a 45-minute phone interview with a Compulsory Education Unit officer to understand more about her family background. Parents interviewed by TODAY said that the call is also to verify parents’ educational backgrounds, adding that MOE requires the homeschooling parent to hold a degree. Subsequently, the officer informed Mrs Nyoto, who has a master’s degree in religious education, that enrolling her son in a primary school was mandatory by law. Proof of successful placement in a primary school was required before she was given a two-week deadline to submit a six-year curriculum plan as part of the homeschooling application. Once a child receives approval for homeschooling, the parent must withdraw their placement from the school. The school will also be formally notified of the student’s withdrawal, Mrs Nyoto explained. In its response to TODAY, MOE said that parents applying to homeschool their children must submit a detailed academic learning plan for the four main academic subjects at the primary level, as well as for Character and Citizenship Education. This should include the proposed teaching schedules and details of the children’s learning in the different areas. “Annually, parents are also required to submit a progress report updating MOE of the progress of their child’s learning in different areas,” the ministry added. Mrs Nyoto shared: “In total you may need to fill in 60 to 80 pages depending on your family. My curriculum plan alone for four subjects was about 40 pages for a six-year education plan.” Once her curriculum plan was approved, Mrs Nyoto received a home visit from a Compulsory Education Unit officer to assess the home environment the child would be studying in, during which the entire family had to be present. “You have to show them the materials you will use to teach your children, and they will check where you homeschool, like if the TV is too near and all that,” she said. She successfully obtained a homeschooling exemption from the ministry in 2020 for her oldest son. Another son, Elijah, eight, is also being homeschooled while her youngest child Onesimus, four, is also taught by her. Mrs Nyoto shared that an MOE officer would arrange a house visit when the child reaches Primary Three to review their work from the past two years and ensure they are meeting learning milestones. MOE said that its inspectors would engage parents during home visits to “ascertain the delivery of the learning outcomes in the different domains”. It added that the visits allow the officers to understand from parents about their homeschooling progress, strengths, and areas for improvement. In terms of assessment, homeschooled children are required to undertake a mid-term assessment in Primary 4 to gauge their learning progress. They also need to take a digital game-based National Education quiz before taking the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) in Primary Six. Another home visit would also be arranged if a child fails a subject in the Primary 4 assessment, parents told TODAY. For PSLE, homeschooled children must meet a benchmark pegged at the 33rd percentile of all students in national primary schools taking four standard-level subjects in that same year , said MOE on its website. This is equivalent to scoring well enough to qualify for the express stream of a national secondary school under a previous scoring system, or about an Achievement Level of 21 under the new system introduced in 2021. Students who do not meet the Achievement Level of the PSLE's posting group 1, which is between 25 and 30, must be enrolled into mainstream schools. Those who pass but do not meet the benchmark can continue to be homeschooled but must take the PSLE again the following year until they pass the benchmark or reach the age of 15, whichever occurs earlier, Ms Mattar, whose four children have passed the PSLE, told TODAY. MOE said that parents of homeschooling children may approach the ministry at any time to enrol their children in a mainstream school, which will work closely with them to support their children’s transition. For secondary school-aged homeschoolers who wish to be admitted to a mainstream school, the ministry said that they can also approach the secondary schools directly. These students' admission would be “subject to the school’s prevailing vacancies and admission criteria, which may involve school-based assessments”. “Alternatively, they may apply for Direct School Admission to secondary schools based on their talent in any of the DSA-recognised talent areas,” MOE said. For many parents who have homeschooled, or are currently homeschooling their children, one major appeal of the pathway lies in providing their charges with personalised attention and the flexibility of allowing them to learn at their own pace. For Ms Tang, who has a six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter and is currently pursuing a doctorate degree in medicine, the idea of homeschooling came up when she found her son to be a highly-gifted child at the age of four. Ms Tang, 33, who declined to give her full name for privacy reasons, said her son could speak full sentences before the age of one and was tackling math workbooks designed for Primary 3 students by the time he was three. Subsequent tests revealed his IQ to be an impressive 154 — well above the average IQ of 100 for a normal individual. “Part of being gifted is the asynchrony of development. He may be more developed in the cognitive sense, but another part of it may not be as critically developed, which is up to us as the parent to observe and give this one-to-one attention,” Ms Tang said. “With homeschooling, I can make it more child-led. So we can actually cater for the child to accelerate his pace of learning.” Agreeing, Mr Raymond Lim said that for children at a young age, a lot of their development should revolve around observing them to understand their needs. “I feel that it's actually understanding what they need now and also to observe their feelings. In the classroom setting, it’s one to 35 (children) which is even tougher (to do so),” Mr Lim said. He added that homeschooling provides one-on-one time and allows his children to review and master concepts at their own pace. Many parents are also drawn to the prospect of offering their children a holistic and creative education that goes beyond academic excellence. This is why Ms Tupili homeschools her children using the Classical Conversations syllabus, which emphasises learning through memory work and includes philosophical works by Socrates and Plato, as well as Latin language and history, among other subjects. “A child must be given the opportunity to know the world and learning the way of life of these ancient people enriches a (child) and I think they become better citizens,” she said. Ms Lenora Lin, 44, on the other hand, homeschools her eight-year-old daughter Liv using the unschooling method, a child-led approach that encourages learning through natural life experiences. Entrepreneurship fairs organised by the homeschooling community teach her daughter business skills, financial literacy, and adaptability. \"It’s about handing her the reins and letting her learn practical skills on her own initiative,\" said Ms Lin, who holds a degree in drama and theatre and works as a part-time coach at Forest School Singapore. While proponents often highlight the holistic aspect of homeschooling, education experts pointed out that Singapore’s education system compares favourably with some of the world’s best, as reflected by various international benchmarks. Singaporean students excelled in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa), ranking first in mathematics, science and reading among 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Singapore's Primary 4 students also achieved the highest global reading proficiency in the 2021 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study results. Even with such achievements, Dr Betsy Ng, an education research scientist at the Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice at NIE, said that MOE has continued to enhance the education system to shift its focus away from an assessment-heavy one. “For example, in 2023, they eliminated mid-year examinations for primary and secondary schools. Additionally, they introduced changes to the banding system, including the implementation of full subject-based banding in secondary schools,” Dr Ng said. Still, Ms Dawn Fung, an author and activist advocating for children’s rights through education reform in Singapore, said more can be done to provide an education that is “purposeful and meaningful” to children. “Homeschooling offers a competing narrative (to mainstream education). There is nothing wrong with studying maths, English, science, but why must students learn them all in the same way?” Ms Fung said. “Why can’t they be appraised with creative projects that are less stressful? Why can’t parents mix and match?” While homeschooling affords flexibility and personalised education, it also presents its own set of challenges. Each child has unique learning needs and paces, forcing parents to adapt by juggling multiple curricula and learning styles simultaneously. Mrs Nyoto, who homeschools her three sons, said that the challenge lies in handling three curricula of different levels on her own. “In school, teachers only focus on one level at a time. But for mums at home we have to tackle curricula of different levels at the same time,” she said. Since she has all her children study at the same time, she must ensure that each receives individualised attention in subjects where they excel or struggle. The key to managing this is taking turns — when one child works on a challenging subject, the other two are assigned more manageable tasks, allowing her to evenly divide her attention among all three. “Like when I’m guiding one child, the other children will be assigned work they don’t need help with. Usually with English, they’re able to handle it so I can help another one with science or Chinese,” Mrs Nyoto said. As for Ms Mattar, one of her challenges lies in helping her four children learn more advanced subjects as they get older and the material becomes more difficult. “In school everything is prepared, you have all the teachers there and the children can learn everything they need. For us, we have to actively look, ‘Where am I going to find someone whom they can learn history from?’ for example,” she said. To tackle this, some homeschooling families form a learning co-operative and share resources, with parents with expertise in specific subjects taking turns to teach a group of children. These co-ops typically consist of five to eight families who meet regularly each week for lessons. In terms of socialisation, parents also shared that many people have the misconception that homeschooled children are under-socialised. According to those interviewed, this is where the co-operatives come in — by offering homeschooled children opportunities to interact with their peers and engage in social activities like sports through regular gatherings. Associate Professor of Sociology Daniel Goh, from the National University of Singapore (NUS), said that he does not see any pedagogical issues with homeschooling, adding that homeschooling parents “are very well-resourced and resourceful in finding their own plug-ins to make sure their children do not miss out and are integrated in mainstream (society)”. Several youths who had transitioned from homeschooling to tertiary education told TODAY that they generally enjoyed their homeschooling years, but some initially struggled with group work in university. Mr Reuben Teo, 24, a first-year political science student at the Singapore Management University, said he had to adapt to his peers' working styles in group projects due to the individual nature of homeschooling. “I don’t have a problem working in groups, but homeschooling is a good and bad thing in that you can do the individual work by yourself easily enough, but when it comes to projects, you’re either so efficient that you get impatient waiting for the rest to catch up, or you just don't know what to do,” Mr Teo said. Ms Ariel Ess, a 24-year-old electrical and electronic engineering student at NTU who was fully homeschooled till 16, said she wished she had attended mainstream schools. She initially struggled with social cues, citing an instance where a minor disagreement among her canoeing teammates caused her significant anxiety as she took it very personally. “When you fight with your siblings at home, your parents will step in so there’s always a buffer. But when you go into work, internships or projects, there’s no one to tell you who is right, you have to come to a consensus on your own,” she said. Ms Ess also felt that there might have been more opportunities for her to try different things and interact with people in a mainstream school setting. “In homeschooling, we have the freedom to do things, but sometimes you’re not aware of the things you can try. Schools bring you out on outings or overseas and let you interact with other people and you get to hear from their experience as well.” Associate Professor of Sociology Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist from NUS, said that homeschooled children may face such issues raised by Ms Ess when they miss out on having exposure to a microcosm of Singapore society by not participating in the mainstream system. “The exposure would involve being in discussion groups, collaborating with fellow students in school projects, and learning how to relate to a diversity of fellow students,” Assoc Prof Tan said. Parents who are considering homeschooling their children should think carefully as it might not be a viable option for all families, said education experts. Given the strenuous demands of homeschooling, not all parents may be able to cope with it, Assoc Prof Tan from NIE said. “First of all, homeschooling definitely demands that parents commit themselves fully to the task of educating their children outside of school. They have to be able to undertake that heavy responsibility not just in the short term, but for a sustained period of time.” He added that children in the same family may also respond differently to homeschooling methods due to individual differences. Assoc Prof Tan also urged parents to consider the affordability of homeschooling as families also need a certain level of financial security to be able to undertake this pathway. Dr Ho of ClassPoint Consulting advised parents to consider their preparedness, commitment level and knowledge of subjects before making such a major decision. “It's a big investment because it is about individualisation of education, so you have to do everything on your own. And it's not just about financial commitment, it’s also time. At some point, you may have to reintegrate back into the mainstream system,” he said. To address these challenges, Assoc Prof Tan from NIE suggested that parents who lack confidence in teaching subjects like literacy and numeracy can use online learning platforms to support their efforts. As homeschooled children get older, it can become increasingly difficult for parents to guide them effectively. “These online programmes are some they can subscribe to, to get access to a complete set of learning and teaching materials,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr Ho recommended that parents who are just starting out on their homeschooling journey form a community to exchange resources and support each other. “The idea of a community is good because you then have shared resources, shared ideas and you can exchange the resources you have as well.” Ultimately, both experts agreed that homeschooling is a niche pathway, and it is up to parents to educate themselves on the pedagogical approach they wish to adopt. Parents must also learn how to track and assess their children's progress to ensure they meet academic standards. Ms Tang, the mother of two who are both homeschooled, also has this advice based on her experience: Don't turn homeschooling into a competition and remember to prioritise the children's needs. “It doesn't mean that if somebody is using a particular learning style, I must also do the same thing. Don't put your child into a mould. It's fine to be flexible and express yourself,” she said. Ms Mattar also said that parents considering homeschooling should be prepared that others in the mainstream system may question their choice. “I think you should be willing to put aside your own bias and be willing to accept there are many ways to get to your final goal, and that may not be the typical way that many will take,” she said. “So be brave and be thick-skinned to (accept) non-conventional pathways.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

When her oldest son completed his first year of kindergarten in 2007, Ms Mattar, who worked as a private tutor and continues to teach homeschool children math and science today, began to reflect on her own experience in the mainstream school system. She found herself unsatisfied with the schooling options for her son, including international schools, which were too costly. Eventually, she took a leap of faith and homeschooled her son until he was 16. Having enjoyed the lifestyle that homeschooling afforded both her son and herself, Ms Mattar continued to homeschool her second and third children until they were 16. Ms Mattar is part of a small group of parents in Singapore who choose to homeschool their children. Globally, homeschooling is growing in popularity in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. However, this alternative schooling approach is less well-known in Singapore. Associate Professor Jason Tan from the National Institute of Education (NIE) noted that the homeschool community is \"rather scattered” as there is no umbrella body to which all homeschooling families belong. The Ministry of Education (MOE) said in response to TODAY's queries that since the Compulsory Education Act came into effect in 2003, the number of homeschooled children has “remained small and generally constant, at an average of about 50 Singaporean children for each primary age cohort every year”. The Act makes it mandatory for all Singaporean children residing in the country, who are above six years old and under 15, to attend a national primary school unless an exemption is granted. MOE does not track the number of Singaporean children who are homeschooled at the secondary level and higher as they do not come under the Act’s purview. But the ministry said that this number is likely to be fewer than that for primary school for each cohort, as many homeschooled children do eventually enrol in mainstream primary schools or secondary schools. Each homeschooling application is reviewed on a case-by-case basis by MOE to ensure that the children's educational development is safeguarded. The ministry does not provide a recommended curriculum for parents who wish to homeschool their children. Parents who homeschool and education experts say that this educational pathway is not without challenges and is not for everyone. For one thing, as each child has unique learning needs, parents must also adapt by juggling multiple curricula and learning styles simultaneously. Some may also struggle with helping their children learn more advanced subjects as they get older and the material becomes more difficult. To tackle these challenges, some homeschooling families form a learning co-operative and share resources, with parents with expertise in specific subjects taking turns to teach a group of children. These co-ops typically consist of five to eight families who meet regularly each week for lessons. In terms of socialisation, parents also shared that many people have the misconception that homeschooled children are under-socialised. According to those interviewed, this is where the co-operatives come in — by offering homeschooled children opportunities to interact with their peers and engage in social activities like sports through regular gatherings. Singapore's education system is highly regarded internationally. Singaporean students ranked first in mathematics, science and reading in the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) among 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, while Primary 4 students achieved the highest global reading proficiency in the 2021 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study. Still, some parents opt not to enrol their children in mainstream schools for a variety of reasons. Most tell TODAY that they want to provide a more personalised and flexible education, without the stress and rigidity often associated with conventional schooling. For Ms Tang, who has a six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter and is currently pursuing a doctorate degree in medicine, the idea of homeschooling came up when she found her son to be a highly-gifted child at the age of four. Ms Tang, 33, who declined to give her full name for privacy reasons, said her son was tackling math workbooks designed for Primary 3 students by the time he was three and subsequent tests revealed his IQ to be an impressive 154 — well above the average IQ of 100 for a normal individual. “Part of being gifted is the asynchrony of development. He may be more developed in the cognitive sense, but another part of it may not be as critically developed, which is up to us as the parent to observe and give this one-to-one attention,” she said. “With homeschooling, I can make it more child-led. So we can actually cater for the child to accelerate his pace of learning.” Parents are also drawn to providing their children with a holistic and creative education beyond mere academic excellence. This is why former architect Anju Tupili, 50, homeschools her children using the Classical Conversations syllabus, which emphasises learning through memory work and includes philosophical works by Socrates and Plato, as well as Latin language and history, among other subjects. “A child must be given the opportunity to know the world and learning the way of life of these ancient people enriches a (child) and I think they become better citizens,” the mother of three said. Ms Lenora Lin, 44, on the other hand, homeschools her eight-year-old daughter Liv using the unschooling method, a child-led approach that encourages learning through natural life experiences. Entrepreneurship fairs organised by the homeschooling community teach her daughter business skills, financial literacy, and adaptability. \"It’s about handing her the reins and letting her learn practical skills on her own initiative,\" said Ms Lin, who holds a degree in drama and theatre and works as a part-time coach at Forest School Singapore. While homeschooling appeals to some families, it requires significant commitment from parents, who must be able to dedicate time, resources, and a deep understanding of their child's educational and developmental requirements. Dr Ho Boon Tiong, principal consultant educationist at training and consulting firm ClassPoint Consulting, advised parents to consider their preparedness, commitment level and knowledge of subjects before making such a major decision. “It's a big investment because it is about individualisation of education, so you have to do everything on your own. And it's not just about financial commitment, it’s also time. At some point, you may have to reintegrate back into the mainstream system,” he said. Given the strenuous demands of homeschooling, not all parents may be able to cope with it, Assoc Prof Tan from NIE said. “First of all, homeschooling definitely demands that parents commit themselves fully to the task of educating their children outside of school. They have to be able to undertake that heavy responsibility not just in the short term, but for a sustained period of time.” Assoc Prof Tan also urged parents to consider the affordability of homeschooling as families need a certain level of financial security to be able to undertake this pathway. He added that children in the same family may also respond differently to homeschooling methods due to individual differences. Ultimately, experts say that homeschooling is a niche pathway, and it is up to parents to educate themselves on the pedagogical approach they wish to adopt. Parents must also learn how to track and assess their children's progress to ensure they meet academic standards. Ms Tang, the mother of two who are both schooled at home, also has this advice based on her experience: Don't turn homeschooling into a competition and remember to prioritise the children's needs. “It doesn't mean that if somebody is using a particular learning style, I must also do the same thing. Don't put your child into a mould. It's fine to be flexible and express yourself,” she said.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — One of the toughest balancing acts that successive Singapore’s leaders have had to manage over the decades is to bring in foreign talent to the city-state while mitigating the inevitable tensions that come with it. Way back in the 1980s, founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew had already spoken of the need to bring in skilled foreigners to spur Singaporean workers, and of the importance of expanding the talent pool given the country’s small population. Some 40 years later, when Singapore was on the cusp of leadership change last month, both the then incumbent prime minister and his successor would also broach the thorny issue. Mr Lee Hsien Loong, in a media interview before handing over the reins to his deputy, Mr Lawrence Wong, described managing the “inherent tensions” between wanting social cohesion and bringing in immigrants as the “most difficult” issue he has had to deal with during his 20-year tenure as Singapore’s third prime minister. Mr Wong, who assumed the premiership on May 15, told The Economist weekly in an interview on May 6 that while Singapore welcomes foreign professionals, it will be carefully managed. “Because if it is not controlled, I think we will be easily swamped,” he said in the interview. In recent years, the manpower and talent issue in Singapore has taken on an added urgency as the nation grapples with the double whammy of falling birth rates and rapidly ageing population — which will add up to a drop in the number of working-age adults. Singapore's total fertility rate, already dwindling since 2018, dipped to a historic low of 0.97 for 2023. The fertility rate needed for a generation to replace its preceding one is 2.1. At the other end of the life spectrum, Singapore is poised to become a “super aged” society by 2026 — where 21 per cent of its local population is above the age of 65. By 2030, this number will grow to one in four. Despite such statistics pointing to the city-state’s need for foreign manpower, many Singaporeans are still not convinced by the need for such a huge foreign presence, making the issue a perennial political hot potato. In fact, some political observers even felt that the foreign talent issue contributed to the watershed 2011 General Election, which saw the ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) losing a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) for the first time. Since then, the Government has introduced a slew of new measures — or enhanced existing ones — to address Singaporeans’ concerns over foreign manpower. These include tightening control over inflow of foreign workers, protecting citizens from unfair competition, and building up the local talent pool through training and international exposure. But the at-times heated chatter over foreign talent and manpower simply refuses to go away — as can be seen from media reports, online discussions and parliamentary debates. Political analyst from the Singapore Management University (SMU) Eugene Tan said: “The harsh reality about immigration is that once the immigration genie is out of the bottle, it will not be easy to put the genie back in the bottle.” “Efforts can be made to assuage concerns but there are limits to what can be done,” added the associate professor of law. Politics aside, businesses, economists and recruiters who spoke to TODAY agreed on the economic need for foreign manpower. “Foreigners are actually useful, especially in certain high skilled areas where there are just not enough Singaporeans and not enough time to train the Singaporeans to take advantage of the economic opportunities,” said labour economist Walter Theseira. Nonetheless, economic and political observers pointed out that the impact of bringing in foreigners goes beyond dollars and cents, and feathers have been ruffled due to social reasons too. They cautioned that further tightening supply or being even more selective in the foreign talent that the country brings in may not be most feasible as it would risk creating a shortage of skills and blunting Singapore’s competitiveness. As such, to soothe the feelings of unease and unhappiness among the citizenry, the Government and other stakeholders will need to address factors that go beyond jobs, such as making sure that Singaporeans feel their needs are sufficiently met in other aspects of their lives as well. At the same time, some experts said, Singapore must also be mindful of one thing: It cannot take for granted its ability to attract such foreign talent in the first place, as adverse global business and geopolitical conditions in recent years are making some companies rethink their placement of staff or business operations here. Any move that makes it more difficult for businesses to hire global talent that they need for their Singapore operations might be a further disincentive for them to set up shop here, and lead them to take their business elsewhere. Whenever the Government moves to tighten the supply of foreign manpower, there will be an outcry from the business community — and this is something that economists and industry watchers can emphasise with. First off, the pipeline of talent here is generally small to begin with, they noted. Ms Lee Pui Kheng of Unispace Singapore, a firm dealing in workplace design, planning and construction, gave the example of her own undergraduate course — project and facilities management at the National University of Singapore (NUS) — where her cohort had only about 130 students. Half of them specialised in project management while the remainder in facilities management, and “and as we know, when you graduate from university, you don’t necessarily pursue a (career aligned to your) course”, she said. “So you can see that the pool is actually getting smaller and smaller,” said Ms Lee, who is principal of technical delivery at the firm. Unispace is an Australia-headquartered global company but its Singapore office has about 20 staff, of which 30 per cent are foreigners. Companies interviewed by TODAY said that workers with more experience or niche skills are naturally in even shorter supply. And for young and small firms like warehousing automation company XSQUARE Technologies, they tend to lose these talent to more established ones, said its chief executive officer Jens Bohnwagner. “To operate effectively, we need both qualifications and experience, and building experience takes time. To bridge this gap, we hire experienced tech professionals from overseas to work alongside our local junior tech talent,” he said. XSQUARE Technologies was set up in 2019 and around 30 staff here, with seven in 10 being locals. A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore (AmCham Singapore) in 2023 found that the ability to hire locals is one of the key manpower issues its member companies are facing. Candidates' lack of technical skills or knowledge for the role is cited as one of the biggest obstacles in hiring locals, leading companies to employ foreigners. AmCham's members comprise a mix of American and other global companies, as well as Singaporean companies. At the national level, not having the foreign worker headcount would naturally lead to a smaller aggregate economic output for the country, all else being constant. Singapore’s total population as of June 2023 was 5.92 million. Out of this, the non-resident population — which includes foreign workers, their dependents and international students — numbered 1.77 million. According to the Singapore Department of Statistics, Singapore's total population grew from 4.59 million in 2007 to 5.18 million in 2011. During that period, the resident population grew 5.75 per cent (3.58 million to 3.79 million) while non-residents grew 38.7 per cent (from 1 million to 1.39 million). Between 2011 and 2015, the total population grew from 5.18 million to 5.54 million. Resident population grew by 2.99 per cent (from 3.79 million to 3.9 million), while non-residents grew 17.1 per cent (1.39 million to 1.63 million). Total population recorded negative growth in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19 pandemic disruptions and border lockdowns, which led to some non-residents leaving and some Singaporeans being stuck overseas. But in 2022, total population grew at 3.4 per cent from the year before (5.45 million to 5.64 million). Resident population grew 2.17 per cent (to 4.07 million) while non-resident population grew 6.62 per cent (to 1.56 million). Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic advisor at financial service provider CGS International, said that it is also worth noting that any cut in foreign talent would cause a “multiplier” effect too, as each worker is not only a producer in their own industry, but also a consumer. “Without the extra mouths that come and live and work here in Singapore, namely the foreigners, who are you opening your restaurants to? Who are you renting your houses to?” he said. He pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic as a real-life illustration of such an impact, where many foreign workers left the country due to border restrictions and many businesses came to a standstill. “It won't be the exact scale, but it gives a flavour of what can happen,” he said. In discussions over the issue, one often-heard refrain among Singaporeans is that they are fine with foreigners coming here to contribute to the economy — so long as they do not compete with roles that Singaporeans want and are able to fill. By extension, this could mean being even more selective when bringing in foreigners to fill mid- to top-level positions. Another corollary to such a view is that Singapore companies should hire foreigners only for jobs that are less desirable to its citizens — mostly the lower-skilled ones — and reserve the top-tier jobs for citizens. Economic experts as well as talent recruiters like Mr Kenji Naito, group chief executive officer of Reeracoen, said that while it may be theoretically possible to be highly selective when hiring foreign talent for senior positions, this is not practical or beneficial in the long term. “Further restrictions could risk creating talent gaps that might hinder innovation and competitiveness. Striking a balance between protecting local jobs and attracting essential foreign talent is crucial,” said Mr Naito. The suggestion that higher-value jobs should be kept exclusively for locals would be problematic, too. First, with the finite local headcount that is also shrinking due to low birth rate, there could be a limit to the number of industries Singapore can tap if the industry leaders are to only comprise local talent. As new growth areas of business sprout rapidly, it may be harder to project with “confidence” the talent and skill sets relevant for future growth, like Singapore has traditionally tried to do all these years, said Mr Song. In turn, it would be difficult for Singapore to prepare a pipeline of such talent in advance. And if Singapore is not open to taking in relevant foreign talent at the top end to quickly plug that gap, it will yet again risk missing out on opportunities presented by new growth areas. Apart from losing the Aljunied GRC, the 2011 General Election also saw the ruling PAP getting its lowest vote share since the Republic’s independence — 60.1 per cent — with the issue of migrants’ influx widely viewed as the lightning rod for voters’ unhappiness with the Government. Over the past decade, the Government has announced numerous measures or reinforced them as it sought to address Singaporeans' concerns on foreign talent and manpower. These measures include: Controlling numbers Ensuring talent quality Shielding residents from unfair competition Facilitating integration Numerous measures (see sidebar above) have been introduced or reinforced since then to address the dissatisfaction among locals. Observers said that on the whole, the various policies are designed to strike a balance between having a sufficient foreign workplace that is both of high quality and complementary to Singapore workers and assuaging Singaporeans' concerns about their livelihoods and future. Yet it is debatable how far these policies have succeeded in shifting Singaporeans' attitudes towards foreign workers. A survey of 2,000 Singapore residents released in 2020 found that seven in 10 want strict limits on the number of foreigners entering the country. Amid the continuing debate, two questions whose answers could offer Singaporeans a better picture would be these: How has the bringing in of foreign manpower impacted local employment, and how has the control measures over the years improved the situation? Then visiting research fellow at the Adam Smith Center Singapore, Mr Donovan Choy, pointed out in a TODAY commentary in 2021 that the percentage of non-residents among the total population here had grown from about 14 per cent in 1995 to 29 per cent in 2020. Yet the unemployment rates of Singaporean citizens and permanent residents had remained relatively stagnant over the same period, never breaking 5.2 per cent. “Contrary to popular belief, immigrant inflows to Singapore are not throwing citizens into mass unemployment,” he wrote. Instances of discrimination experienced at work or during job search, including over one’s nationality, seemed to have also dipped, according to the Ministry of Manpower’s fair employment practices report in July 2023. Specifically for discrimination based on nationality, the proportion of resident job applicants reporting such an experience declined from 14.2 per cent in 2018 to 6.2 per cent in 2021 and 4.0 per cent in 2022. Despite the Government’s continuing efforts to promote and enhance the “Singaporean core” in the workforce — and even amid acceptance by many Singaporeans that the country needs foreign talent — why do tensions persist over this issue? When it comes to emotive issues, what people perceive can easily be taken for granted as facts, experts told TODAY. “So the perception that foreigners are preventing Singaporeans from being promoted or taking away their jobs, those very quickly become regarded as ‘facts’,” said Dr Tan from SMU. “So even as the Government has been trying its best to address concerns, it may not be seen as sufficient.” More importantly, experts pointed out that job competition is but one part of the tensions. Assoc Prof Theseira said that given the fact that Singapore is selective of the foreign talents it brings in, by default these workers will be earning higher than the average Singaporean. Seeing foreigners able to better afford coveted things like cars and private homes, for example, would thus fuel a perception of inequality, he said. For this reason, the Government has also rolled out measures outside of the labour market to address these concerns. These include beefing up public infrastructure capacity, as well as dampening a hot private housing market , and disincentivising foreign investment in the latter. The boosting of public infrastructure is also necessary because Singapore faces a similar conundrum on foreign manpower at the other end of the scale, given that a large number of blue-collar migrant workers are needed to do the jobs that Singaporeans shun. Sociologist Tan Ern Ser from NUS said: “Competition can produce tension and conflict; hence, the need to ensure that there is enough of the things that matter to Singaporeans at the workplace, schools, and neighbourhoods. “And from this starting point, to facilitate collaboration and mutual understanding between Singaporeans and the foreigners in our midst.” Beyond just top-down policies, it is important for locals and foreigners themselves to form bridges between one another, said Dr Leong Chan-Hoong, a Senior Fellow for Social Cohesion Research at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “The shared narrative, the shared experiences (between locals and non-locals) is less articulated in public,” he said, adding that this narrative is important as we continue developing as a global city state. “We need to move beyond ‘how much you get, how much I get’. It's about how much we are doing this together? And I think this is the narrative that is missing.” A possible way to do this is to encourage ground-up groups that aim to address problems that are “universal” or that both locals and non-locals can empathise with, such as on tackling parenting challenges or even second-hand smoke. This would also help to strengthen the idea that the non-locals are here to contribute, and not just here to take up jobs. An MCCY spokesperson said: “For integration to be effective and sustained, it needs a whole-of-society effort — foreigners to actively contribute to the local community and adapt to local culture and norms, and Singaporeans to also be inclusive, patient, and willing to learn from foreigners.” On top of implementing measures that sought to allay Singaporeans' concerns, the Government has also repeatedly stressed to the public the importance of foreign manpower to Singapore, though how it delivers the message seems to have changed slightly over time, some observers noted. For example, true to his character, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew never minced words when it came to migrants and foreign talent. In a speech in 1980 commenting on the work attitude of some Singapore-born labour which he found lacking, Mr Lee said that better quality foreign labour “can put the spurs on the hinds of Singaporean”, while immigration of such talent “will make Singaporeans sit up and try harder”. When asked during an engagement session with tertiary students in 2003 about whether it was worth re-examining the foreign talent policy, Mr Lee, who was then Senior Minister, unequivocally said that changing the policy will “undercut [Singapore’s] capability to grow and expand”. “There are 4 million (people) in Singapore, 1 million are foreigners. You get rid of that 1 million foreigners, you will be unemployed. Many of you will not find jobs,” he said. In more recent times, political leaders have time and again explained the need for foreigners to supplement the local workforce. But in the same breath, they would also reiterate how locals are being prioritised or at least not sidelined, political observers said. They also noted that the shift to emphasise the second half of the message — prioritising locals — was more apparent post-2011 General Election. Dr Tan of NUS said the messaging about the need for foreign manpower today still remains “quite stark”, adding that this complements the message about prioritising Singaporeans. “Prioritising Singaporeans and welcoming of foreign labour are not mutually exclusive,” he said. Meanwhile, SMU’s Assoc Prof Tan said that it is not easy for the Government to send a starker message that Singapore can't survive without foreigners. “The political climate today makes it challenging to put forth the message that we need foreigners to augment the capacity and capability of our workforce in terms of both quantity and quality”. When asked if there might be a downside to what could be deemed as a softer messaging, he agreed. “An undue focus on what’s been done to ‘protect’ Singaporeans’ interests can easily become one of pressing the Government to adopt protectionist measures,” he said. Political analyst Felix Tan also cautioned against “giving the wrong signals to potential investors”. He added that to truly address the foreign manpower conundrum requires more than just Government policies, and Singapore society as a whole “needs to do much more” to better integrate non-locals and locals. Amid the angst over the number and type of foreign talents that Singapore needs, it is also important to be cognisant of the fact that Singapore may one day lose its lustre as the city of choice for foreigners seeking to work outside of their countries. Manpower and economic experts were already pointing out a few years ago that while Singapore remained attractive, other cities were catching up in their efforts to woo coveted global talent. Recruiters were saying then that some executive candidates already had multiple offers on hand by the time they were interviewed for a position in Singapore. One such headhunter was advising its clients to be prepared as there were “an awful lot of offers rejected”. In the last couple of years, rising rentals and costs of living have also led some expatriates to leave Singapore. Last year, 70 per cent of about 270 companies said they were ready to relocate their staff out of Singapore if operating costs were left to rise unabated, according to a survey done by the European Chamber of Commerce, Singapore. Economic nationalism and protectionism may also pose a threat to investment inflows into Singapore, business experts and analysts told news platform CNA in April last year. Ms Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank, told TODAY: \"The competition for foreign direct investment and talent is real and intensifying due to the ebb and wane of many factors including cost of living, geopolitics, growth industries, attractiveness of the place to work and live and so on.\" However, she also added: \"Given the holistic and forward-looking — some may say far-sighted — policymaking framework here, dealing with the cut and thrust of competition for talent and foreign direct investment is not new.\" In April this year, Nikkei Asia reported how multinational corporations are increasingly relocating some of their regional headquarter functions away from Singapore. Costs and tax advantages of neighbouring countries as well “concentration of production sites” in an alternative country were cited as reasons. Recruiters who spoke to TODAY recently also noted that some of their clients had concerns about maintaining their headcount here. “These concerns primarily revolve around rising operational costs and the challenges posed by global supply chain disruptions,” said Mr Naito of Reeracoen. Separately, according to latest figures, the Economic Development Board in 2023 attracted investment commitments amounting to S$12.7 billion in fixed asset investment. This is much lower than the record S$22.5 billion attracted the year before, but is “in line with past trends”, said the board. On a brighter note, the 2023 edition of The Global Talent Competitiveness Index by Insead found that Singapore has retained its second place on the annual index. Mr Victor Mills, chief executive of Singapore International Chamber of Commerce, said: “Companies will always decide what’s best for them in terms of location based on their needs.” As for Singapore, attributes that it still maintains are the rule of law, a fair and progressive tax regime, access to finance and the region, a safe and pleasant place to live and political stability, he said. Dr Lei Hsien-Hsien, chief executive officer of AmCham Singapore said that by and large, interest and commitment of American companies to Singapore remains business-as-usual, if not better. She cautioned against overblowing cases of some individual companies leaving Singapore, adding that such cases need to be looked at \"on a deeper level\" to understand their individual considerations for closing shop here. Still, the experts interviewed by TODAY agreed that further restricting the inflow of foreign talent would only serve to make operating here a tad more onerous for global companies — a step that should not be taken unnecessarily in light of the shifting global dynamics and competition. Assoc Prof Theseira said there is \"a real risk\" that some companies, if faced by shortages of talent or too many restrictions in bringing in manpower, will consider putting their investment elsewhere. \"So the question for Singapore must be, how many of these things will we have to say no to, or will say no to us, before we start to lose our competitive edge?\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

At the other end of the life spectrum, Singapore is on track to become a “super aged” society by 2026 — where 21 per cent of its local population is above the age of 65. By 2030, this number will grow to one in four. In fact, efforts to tighten inflow of foreign manpower using levers like raising levies and tweaking local-foreign worker ratios for certain industries are constantly met by vocal concerns from businesses here. At the national level, not having the foreign worker headcount would naturally lead to a smaller aggregate economic output for the country, all else being constant. Singapore’s total population as of June 2023 was 5.92 million. Out of this, the non-resident population — which includes foreign workers, their dependents and international students — numbered 1.77 million. Prior to 2011, the population growth of non-residents generally far outstripped that of residents — though this gap has since shrunk in recent years. Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic advisor at financial service provider CGS International, said that it is also worth noting that any cut in foreign talent would cause a “multiplier” effect too, as each worker is not only a producer in their own industry, but also a consumer. He pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic as a real-life illustration of such an impact, where many foreign workers left the country due to border restrictions and many businesses came to a standstill. “It won't be the exact scale, but it gives a flavour of what can happen,” he said. On the less numerous yet still critical skilled foreign talent on the upper-end of the job ladder, experts said it is important to bring them in so that Singapore can tap new growth areas, for which the local talent pool has yet to have sufficient numbers for. If Singapore were to lag behind or miss out entirely on opportunities arising from new and rapidly growing industries, the overall competitiveness and economic growth of the nation may be put at risk, said the experts. Thus, the view among some that Singapore should hire foreigners only for jobs that are less desirable to its citizens — mostly the lower-skilled ones — and reserve the top-tier jobs for locals is problematic. An influx of foreigners prior to the 2011 General Election is widely seen as a factor behind why the ruling People’s Action Party lost a Group Representation Constituency for the first time and secured its lowest vote share since the Republic’s independence — 60.1 per cent. Numerous measures have been introduced or reinforced since then to address the dissatisfaction among locals. These include those directly addressing the foreign labour market such as by tweaking the dependency ratio ceiling (the maximum ratio of foreign workers to the total workforce that a company in a given sector can employ) and raising foreign worker levy, as well as being more selective and transparent about the skilled workers brought in. The Fair Consideration Framework — which ensures that firms try their best to hire Singaporeans first, before looking overseas — was introduced in 2009, and then strengthened in 2020 with tougher penalties. Yet dissatisfaction still persists among some quarters here. Some economists point to a sense of inequality perceived by locals. This is further exacerbated by the fact that in being selective of the foreign talent brought in, Singapore inevitably bring in the higher-earning ones. Seeing foreigners able to better afford coveted things like cars and private homes, for example, would thus fuel a perception of inequality. For this reason, the Government has also rolled measures outside of the labour market to address these concerns. These include beefing up public infrastructure capacity, as well as dampening a hot private housing market , and disincentivising foreign investment in the latter. The boosting of public infrastructure is also necessary because Singapore faces a similar conundrum on foreign manpower at the other end of the scale, given that a large number of blue-collar migrant workers are needed to do the jobs that Singaporeans shun. Observers noted the Government has also put forth a more nuanced messaging: While foreign manpower and talent are critical, Singapore residents are still prioritised. SMU's Associate Professor Tan said that it is not easy for the Government to send a starker message that Singapore can't survive without foreign workers — a message Mr Lee Kuan Yew had conveyed in the 1980s right through to the early 2000s. “The political climate today makes it challenging to put forth the message that we need foreigners to augment the capacity and capability of our workforce in terms of both quantity and quality,” added Assoc Prof Tan. When asked if there might be a downside to what could be deemed as a softer messaging, he agreed. “An undue focus on what’s been done to ‘protect’ Singaporeans’ interests can easily become one of pressing the Government to adopt protectionist measures,” he said. Dr Leong Chan-Hoong, a Senior Fellow for social cohesion research at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said that with much already done by the government, it is also important to encourage ground-up efforts to forge a “shared narrative” between locals and non-locals. Through working on issues that both sides can empathise with, it can help strengthen the message that foreigners are here not just to take up jobs, but to contribute to Singapore’s success. In trying to assuage Singaporeans' concerns, we must be careful not to take it to extremes, said business and sociology experts. While communicating that Singaporeans are being prioritised is important, some experts opined that doubling down on it may have its downsides, such as sending a mixed message to would-be investors. There have already been reports about expatriates and some companies leaving Singapore, or contemplating to, in recent years, amid rising rentals and costs. This is further exacerbated by a more volatile global business landscape, characterised by more frequent disruptions. In short, while Singapore has a lot going for it in terms of being an attractive place for businesses and investments, it cannot take for granted for foreigners will always want to come here to work. Labour economist Walter Theseira said there is “a real risk” that some companies, if faced with shortages of talent or too many restrictions in bringing in manpower, will consider putting their investment elsewhere. \"So the question for Singapore must be, how many of these things will we have to say no to, or will say no to us, before we start to lose our competitive edge?\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — For the last two years of his university studies, Mr Andrew William strategically scheduled his timetable to maximise most of his time outside class taking up internship stints. While educational institutes have long emphasised the importance of and helped students secure internships, students are growing increasingly hungry for more internship opportunities outside of school requirements. This audio is AI-generated. Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look why Singapore students are in hot pursuit of internships and some implications of such a rat race. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here . SINGAPORE — For the last two years of his university studies, Mr Andrew William strategically scheduled his timetable to maximise most of his time outside class taking up internship stints. The now-23-year-old would pack his classes into two to three days, allowing him to work for the rest of the week. Weekends were spent in front of his computer, as he toiled for several startups and consultancy companies. In some semesters, he would take on two internships at once while juggling his communication studies at Nanyang Technological University. In total, the Singapore permanent resident completed 10 internships before graduating in 2022 — although only one stint was a graduation requirement. The rest of the internship stints? Mr William had taken them up on his own initiative. To get these internships, Mr William joined his school's consultancy club — which provided networking opportunities. He also took part in case competitions to boost his portfolio. While arming himself with 10 internships might seem like overkill to an earlier generation of undergraduates, Mr William — now works as a management consultant at an American consultancy firm — is part of a growing number of students who have joined the “rat race” for internships even before completing their paper chase at universities and polytechnics. Those who spoke to TODAY said they had taken on at least three internship stints for several reasons: Getting more real-world learning experiences, earning pocket money and hoping to increase their chances of securing a better job after graduation. Getting an internship in well-known companies is no walk in the park, be it for students here or overseas, where the pursuit of multiple internships is also common. CNN reported in 2019 that tech giant Google received 125,000 applications for its internship programme that year in the United States. At investment banking firm Goldman Sachs, 236,000 students applied for its internships in 2022 globally — of which reportedly 1.5 per cent were given a role. An internship opportunity with Formula One motor-racing team Red Bull also drew “thousands” of Singapore-based applicants earlier this year, of which just two students snagged the internship. The competition for internships has even spurred international businesses to tout their ability to help students secure coveted opportunities in the investment banking and consulting industries for a fee. One such business based in Hong Kong, called IBankCoaching, states on its website that it provides job tracking support for internships and “insider tips” to ace interviews with companies such as Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and DBS. The company claims that it can help students “to get into investment banking in London, Singapore and Hong Kong”, but did not state how much its services cost. Taking on multiple internships at a time seems to be par for course, but some youths told TODAY that it comes at a price: Less “me-time” and a toll on their mental well-being. Taking on internships outside of a school curriculum also puts students at risk of taking on stints that proved to be bad experiences, where they were either overworked or asked to do menial tasks such as picking up coffee orders. While most educational institutions pair students with a mentor or career coach throughout their mandatory internship who can help manage company expectations, youths may not have access to such resources when taking on their own internships. “I just dealt with it as there wasn't much I could do but suck it up,” Ms Vera Lim, a 22-year-old National University of Singapore (NUS) business administration student, told TODAY of her experience. Among other things, she worked more days and hours than agreed upon and had to complete some work even while on medical leave. \"It was extremely stressful but I learnt how to set proper boundaries following the incident.\" The competition for internships also raises questions about whether it is a level playing field for students who do not have a network in a particular industry. NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser noted that students who have larger social networks would have better access to opportunities and the relevant information — and hence a higher probability of landing internships. “In short, connections matter, even in a meritocracy,” said Associate Professor Tan. Because of this, lacking connections could translate into internship inequalities — and this would also apply to job opportunities too. Most institutes of higher learning require students to go through an internship as part of their graduation requirements, pointing to the benefits in establishing professional connections and gaining real-world experience. They are seeing more students take up internships beyond the school's requirements — Singapore Management University (SMU), for one, said its students take on an average of 2.6 internships during their studies. To take on these additional internship programmes on their own accord, students go to the extent of attending multiple networking sessions and several rounds of interviews with the companies they are eyeing. Take for example third-year SMU student Koh Liang Jun, 24, who participated in a case competition for the chance to intern at global professional services firm Accenture — which he described as the most “tedious” way to get an internship. In a case competition, students are given a business case study to solve within a set time in teams. Typical prizes include cash and a possible internship opportunity. “Companies are finding different methods to get talents… such as through case competition where people can showcase their knowledge,” said Mr Koh, who is currently on his fourth internship stint, as an automation intern at a bank. But why are they doing it? Students told TODAY it is not just for the working experience or the allowance — it is also to increase their odds at securing their ideal job. Second-year NUS business administration student Ryan Ong added that peer influence also plays a role in his decision to take on four internships, with a fifth planned in New York at the end of the year. “There’s a lot of pressure to take on internships because I see people around me taking on multiple internships. Some are even doing it part- time, building and using connections to get these opportunities,” he said. Pay was not a key factor for the students who spoke to TODAY. They were paid between S$800 and S$1,500 per month. Only one took up an unpaid internship. Mr Felix Tan, founder and chief executive officer of skills-based hiring platform Skilio told TODAY that many companies are moving away from hiring just based on academic grades. With this, internships are not just valuable in helping youths stand out from other candidates when vying for a job — it has become a necessity. “Amid today's job market uncertainty, it is also good advice to ensure valuable use of all your time. In this sense many internships can be value adding and help pave the way into full-time employment,” added Mr Rob Wisdom, director and head of supply chain of recruitment firm Ethos Beathchapman. While this new form of rat race may be unavoidable for students these days, human resource experts warned that there is such a thing as too many internships. Mr Kenji Naito, group chief executive officer of recruitment agency Reeracoen, said that students should “focus on internships that offer meaningful work, learning opportunities, and professional growth rather than simply accumulating numbers”. This is because when a company is hiring a candidate, it looks at what they had done during their internships and how they had performed. So what are the attributes of a good, quality internship? First, it should be structured with clear objectives and learning outcomes, said Mr Naito. There should also be access to mentors who provide guidance and feedback, as well as assignments that challenge and develop the intern’s skill sets. “Companies should also offer feedback through regular performance reviews to help interns grow… and provide exposure to different aspects of the business,” he added. Mr Wisdom said that it is important for interns to identify some of the things they want from their internship programme. “For example, do you know if your personality suits a corporate or small company environment? Or, often had an itch for a certain role but not sure? Scratch it with an internship,” he said. “Employees are undeniably far more successful, happy and value adding in roles and environments that fit them well.” Company reviews and testimonials from former interns may also help students to decide if a particular internship is suitable for them. Looking back, Ms Lim, who has taken on seven internships over the past three years, said she might have taken a different approach when applying for internships if given a second chance. “At the beginning, I was ‘job hopping’ to find my place and interest,” she said, pointing to the array of internships she had done. These included working for a venture capital, organising events and trying her hand out as a marketing intern. “There are much more targeted approaches to taking internships, such as focusing on building up your skills for a particular industry, before taking on internships only within this industry.” Still, she described her internships as “maximising” her potential. “In the end, I’m just trying to do everything to the best of my ability. And through these internships, I can at least be confident that my job in the future fits me, fulfills me financially and has room for me to grow,” said Ms Lim.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — Mr Alan had no idea that his employee had borrowed from “loan sharks” until he was harassed with almost 120 calls over three days from various unlicensed money lenders. While harassment from unlicensed moneylenders, or loan sharks, is nothing new, some illegal lenders have adopted new technologically savvy means. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Mr Alan had no idea that his employee had borrowed from “loan sharks” until he was harassed with almost 120 calls over three days from various unlicensed money lenders. The strategic consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, discovered that his Singaporean employee had given Mr Alan’s name, personal phone number and the company's main line to the illegal moneylenders, listing Mr Alan as a guarantor. “During the period where there was constant harassment, if you don’t pick up right away they will call back immediately. They don’t allow your phone to rest, so if other people try to call you they cannot get through,” said Mr Alan, who is in his 50s. He immediately terminated the man’s contract for placing his office and other colleagues “at risk”. Mr Alan also advised his staff on how to field calls searching for the former employee. “I was more scared for my staff, who might think, ‘what kind of company is this, what is happening?’” While this happened in 2017, Mr Alan received a call from a stranger looking for his ex-employee last yea r . He told the caller that he did not know who the caller was referring to before hanging up, and did not receive any further calls from purported lenders. Mr Alan’s brush with “Ah Longs” — a colloquial term derived from the Cantonese phrase for illegal moneylenders — despite him not having borrowed a cent from them is not unique. In recent years, unlicensed money lenders have used both time-tested and less conventional methods to force their borrowers to pay up — from harassing the latter’s employers to using social media to scare and shame debtors and engaging “runners” to intimidate them. Mr Sebastian Pereira, a sales manager and delivery rider on Foodpanda, also had a taste of another loan-shark tactic last year. The 51-year-old said “nothing looked amiss” when he picked up a cash-on-delivery order for fishball noodles in Pasir Ris. Upon arriving at the drop-off location in Bedok, however, he found more than 10 other delivery riders from various platforms congregating at the void deck. “When I walked towards them, they asked me, ‘Is it for this address? This is a scam, a fake order. It’s a loan - shark case’,” said Mr Pereira, who reported the incident to the delivery platform and was told to discard the food. The other riders, from platforms such as Grab and Lalamove, also had cash-on-delivery orders for the same address placed under a similar username, but the resident had not placed any orders. “It’s another way of harassing the victims, because the loan sharks themselves don’t want to be caught. Especially (for harassment tactics) like paint and graffiti, those people can be caught. But food delivery, you don’t know who they are,” said Mr Pereira. In April 2020, during the Covid-19 circuit breaker, the police released an advisory stating that unlicensed moneylenders had increasingly been making use of food delivery services to harass debtors, such as by ordering large quantities of food, often late at night. For Ms Ika Lestari, the aftermath of her former helper borrowing money from unlicensed moneylenders was two months of calls and messages from various numbers, mostly Malaysian, threatening to burn down her house this year. The intimidation tactics escalated when harassers sent raw pork on two occasions via cash-on-delivery orders through Foodpanda and Grab. Despite blocking many phone numbers that sent threatening messages, the loan sharks still managed to track her down via social media, the 40-year-old teacher said. They took screenshots of public photos of her face and sent them to her with messages such as “Is this you?” and issued other threats such as “I go your house because you block me (sic)”. Ms Ika made four separate police reports during the harassment, which eventually stopped after three months in April this year when she blocked all the contacts and installed a closed-circuit television camera at her main door. In May, Mr Md Sharif Uddin, a Bangladeshi worker, left Singapore after being fired by his employer amid alleged harassment by loan sharks and a failed last - minute appeal to extend his stay. Mr Sharif denied ever taking any loan and the police did not find any evidence that he had borrowed from unlicensed moneylenders. However , the company terminated his employment after the daughter of Mr Sharif’s employer said that she had received debtor’s notes and hell notes addressed to Mr Sharif at her home. There are no publicly available statistics on cases relating to unlicensed money lender harassment, though such cases mak e headlines every now and then. Notably, some lawyers told TODAY that they have seen more cases of teenagers or youths being recruited by these illegal moneylenders as their runners. The police said on Thursday (June 20) that they too have seen an increase in the proportion of youth arrested for u nlicensed money lending activities. From January to May 2024, 8.6 per cent of unlicensed money lending arrests involved youths between the ages of 14 and 19, a spike from 3.1 per cent for the corresponding period in 2023. A search of police news releases by TODAY found at least 67 reported cases of individuals being arrested for allegedly helping loan sharks in the past six months. Many of the cases involved teenagers caught for alleged loanshark harassment, including a 14 - year - old who was arrested on June 5, for suspected involvement in setting a fire outside a flat at Yishun Avenue 6. Since January this year, at least three islandwide operations have been conducted to suppress unlicensed moneylending activities, with over 100 persons being investigated on each occasion for allegedly harassing debtors at their homes, carrying out bank transfers and providing banking information to facilitate unlicensed money lending business. On June 8 , the police said that 128 persons aged between 14 and 73 were being investigated for their suspected involvement in unlicensed moneylending activities, following a five-day islandwide operation in May. On Friday, Ng Kwong Seng, a Singaporean man who rose through the ranks to become a “towkay” (boss) for an illegal moneylending syndicate based in China, was sentenced to 51 months' jail and a fine of S$495,000. For 13 years, Ng had worked for the syndicate, which charged Singapore borrowers 20 per cent interest for loans. With the “Ah Long” menace being a never-ending story, TODAY takes a closer look at how unlicensed moneylender harassment tactics have evolved in this digital age, and why this illicit industry persists. Before the dawn of the digital age, spraying paint and locking gates were among the unlicensed moneylenders’ favourite tools of the trade. Ms Priya (not her real name), who works in the media industry, recalled a period when her family was harassed by loan sharks every few days between 2003 and 2008 after her father was saddled with unpaid debts. “Common tactics were spray paint, putting a copy of my father’s identity card and address in all our neighbours’ letterboxes and chain locking our gate,” said the 34-year-old. Harassers would bang on their door and shout in her family members’ faces to return money when they opened the door. However, unlicensed money lenders had to reduce such “open harassment” tactics when the authorities installed closed-circuit television cameras in all lifts and at lift landings, said Ms Priya. They instead adopted “very silent” approaches, such as having a person pass a letter through the door which demanded repayment. The harassment eventually “tapered off” in 2008, said Ms Priya, who attributed this to a stepped-up police presence in her neighbourhood and her family successfully paying off their loans. Mr Howard (not his real name), 28, recalled his family being the neighbourhood’s “public enemy” when they faced loan shark harassment. The intimidation, which continued for over a month in 2010, included continuous calls looking for his father who had borrowed the money, and vulgarities and threats over the phone. “They spray-painted my father’s and our house details across the block, at the lift lobby, ground floor and car park. We attempted to put a plastic sheet over our door to minimise the mess, however, they went on to splash red paint on our neighbours’ doors,” said Mr Howard. The harassment stopped after one alleged harasser was caught while carrying paint in Mr Howard's neighbourhood. But having been stigmatised as the “family who borrowed from Ah Long”, Mr Howard’s mother later moved the family out of the area. Ms Gloria James, head lawyer at Gloria James Civetta and Co, said that unlicensed money lenders typically use intimidation, harassment and threats to collect debts, including threats of violence to the borrower and their loved ones. She noted that the persons involved in harassing borrowers may not be the actual moneylenders, but other individuals they engage as runners. Recent years have also seen the increasing use of social media not only to harass debtors — but also to advertise and contact potential borrowers, such as in unsolicited messages boasting fast approval loans. “Unlicensed money lenders have increasingly been using online tactics to harass debtors, including posting on social media platforms… this causes embarrassment for the borrowers and it would be difficult to detect given that postings can be made anonymously,” said Ms James. “They may also contact neighbours, family members, co-workers and employers online in an attempt to cause harassment and to embarrass the borrower.” She recalled her recent case where an unlicensed moneylender had contacted the borrower’s estranged wife and mother-in-law on Instagram, and sent them threatening messages in an attempt to demand payment. Another victim of unlicensed money lender harassment, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, said his troubles started last month after his former domestic helper had purportedly borrowed around S$500 from an unlicensed money lender she had met on social media platform TikTok. During the period of harassment, besides calls from unlicensed moneylenders, Mr Tan encountered five to six delivery platform workers from Lalamove sent to collect items from his house for three days. He ended up installing closed-circuit television cameras outside his home in case the harassers took “more aggressive” actions, said the 45-year-old personal trainer. A combination of factors finally put a stop to the harassment, including making a police report, unplugging his land line and urging Lalamove to ban the account that was sending orders to his house. Despite the plethora of strictly regulated licensed money lending alternatives and the exorbitant interest rates charged by loan sharks, many still resort to borrowing money from illegal moneylenders due to financial and socioeconomic reasons, financial experts told TODAY. For the borrowers, the perceived immediate access to cash with minimal documentation and credit checks are key factors that draw them to loan sharks. Associate Professor of Finance Mandy Tham from Singapore Management University (SMU) noted that as legal lending requires the credit assessment of the borrower, it is less accessible to “subprime borrowers” whose credit assessment may not meet the loan requirements. Subprime refers to a credit classification for borrowers who have a limited credit history, and for loans made to such borrowers who may pose a higher risk of being unable to repay their loan. “When one could not meet the credit assessment of legal lenders, one has no choice but to borrow from loan sharks as a last resort, especially after exhausting friends and families,” said Assoc Prof Tham. Those who borrow from loan sharks also tend to be from lower-income backgrounds who may be more “desperate”, and less able to access legal lending options, the experts said. “With the ease of obtaining a credit card today or a credit line from the bank, only the communities that are struggling turn to such options (illegal moneylenders). It is less of an awareness issue, but more of a lack of options,” said Mr Reginald Koh, founder of financial literacy podcast The Financial Coconut. “I believe this will never stop. Loan sharks have always been around, the increased discussion today merely reflects harder financial times for our fellow Singaporeans,” he added. Associate Professor Razwana Begum, head of the public safety and security programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that gig workers, who may be living “day by day” on an unstable income with no savings may also be at “higher risk” of seeking financial assistance from unlicensed moneylenders. “Immigrants and foreign workers are also targeted by unlicensed money lenders. Without established credit histories or sufficient knowledge of local financial systems, immigrants might see unlicensed moneylenders as accessible sources of funds,” said Assoc Prof Razwana, who is also a Nominated Member of Parliament. Over the years, various measures have been introduced to protect borrowers, including tighter regulation of licensed moneylenders and debt collectors, and harsher punishments for unlicensed moneylenders. In a written parliamentary reply on trends in illegal moneylending activities in 2020, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K Shanmugam said that there was “no clear trend of increase” in terms of youths arrested for such offences every year. He added that the police were stepping up efforts to counter these crimes, in light of the economic downturn potentially leading to more people seeking illegal loans. “On the public education front, police launched the fourth anti-unlicensed money lending campaign in January 2020, with the aim of increasing public awareness, first to not to borrow from unlicensed moneylenders or work for them” He added that social assistance and credit counselling agencies also provide help for unlicensed money lender cases. In November 2008, the Moneylenders Act 2008 was passed in Parliament. The Act, which came into effect in March the next year, clarified the money lending activities to be licensed. Under the updated law, all moneylenders who grant secured and unsecured loans to the public have to be licensed and regulated, adhering to regulations including restrictions on publishing false and misleading marketing material. It also introduced measures to counter loansharking such as extending the punishments for those who instigate harassment activities to include caning. Since then, various amendments to the Act have been made, including tightening the laws to tackle loan sharks more effectively. In 2018, changes to the Moneylenders Act were passed in Parliament. These include amendments to help prevent over-borrowing, including adding a cap to ensure that those earning less than S$20,000 a year may borrow only up to S$3,000 from all moneylenders combined. Those earning above this amount can borrow up to six times their monthly income. Regulations related to unlicensed moneylending under the Moneylenders Act 2008 include: As for licensed moneylenders, some of the restrictions they face include: A few years later in 2022, Parliament passed the Debt Collectors Bill to regulate debt collection activities in Singapore, following a “high number of police reports” on debt collector harassment the previous year. A statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs then noted a spike in the number of police reports against debt collectors acting in a manner that caused “alarm and nuisance” to members of the public. The Bill introduced a licensing regime for the debt collection industry, requiring firms to have a licence to operate and have their workers screened and approved by the authorities. Licensed debt collectors told TODAY that since the introduction of the Debt Collectors Act, which took effect in 2023, companies have adapted to greater scrutiny on tactics that might be perceived as harassment . Mr Sean Lee, business manager of Assured Debt Recovery, said that debt recovery is more difficult with the tighter regulations, especially when encountering “aggressive” or uncooperative debtors. Certain debt collection tactics such as hanging banners identifying debtors at their residence are outdated, he said. However, he emphasised that it is also important for the law to weed out the “black sheep” in the industry who may go “overboard” with their debt collection tactics to embarrass debtors. Mr Lee’s staff wear uniforms and adhere to industry practices such as wearing body cameras to record the entire debt recovery process, so that debtors are also clear that the staff are legal debt collectors. Mr Leroy Frank Ratnam, chief executive and commercial adviser at debt collection firm JMS Rogers Global, said the firm follows a “strict protocol” for engagements with debtors. While its debt recovery tactics have remained largely the same, the company has strengthened its “intelligence divisions” to ensure they have the “most accurate data” on debtors to increase the probability of collections. “Gone are the days of using the approach of aggression and intimidation. Debts can be collected with the accurate study of the situation and the crafting of the right strategy to approach,” said Mr Ratnam. More than expanding the ways unlicensed moneylenders harass debtors, online platforms have also enabled recruitment of those who assist unlicensed moneylender activities, especially young persons. Lawyers who have acted in proceedings related to unlicensed moneylending noted an increase in young people being recruited to assist unlicensed money lender activities, including harassing borrowers. Telegram has been a “game changer” in the past five years, as a transnational messaging platform popular among youths where users can be easily recruited for criminal activities , said lawyer Kalidass Murugaiyan, who has worked with young offenders between the age of 16 and 22. “Around 10 to 15 years ago, (recruitment) used to be on websites. There were popular forums where these (listings) were posted, but now it’s gone even deeper, because it’s on Telegram. If you go to Telegram and type ‘Sell ATM card’, you might get something,” said Mr Kalidass from Kalidass Law Corporation. Young people can also be “easily manipulated”, as some unlicensed money lenders will “acclimatise” runners by asking them to do less aggressive modes of harassment, such as placing a debtor's note, before asking them if they want to do “something more” for an additional S$100. Mr Kalidass cited cases where the youths involved were told they only had to place a post-it note at debtors' homes, but were later asked to buy paint and splash it there, which they may feel pressured to do since they were “already in the loop”. Lawyer Ray Louis also noted an increase in young offenders involved in cases of unlicensed moneylender harassment, who were recruited over Telegram or online marketplace Carousell. The youths’ parents were not aware of their involvement with loan sharks until it was uncovered by the authorities, as the youngsters’ handphone usage was unsupervised. “For the young who are naive, it just means going to the debtors' home, doing some stuff and then running away. So they think it's a simple job and they get paid S$50 to S$100,” said Mr Louis from Ray Louis Law Corporation. Furthermore, young persons may be more easily recruited because they or the loan sharks recruiting them are aware that young offenders, such as those between 16 and 21 years old, are likely to get lighter sentences such as probation if convicted, though it is always possible for them to get a harsher punishment like reformative training . “In the past, more adults were involved. However, with the penalty of possibly jail and also caning, a lot of adults may not be willing to take the risk,” said Mr Louis. “My last client was young, (studying) at the Institute of Technical Education and he was accused of harassing debtors. He did get probation, but this exemplifies the trend right now.” As for why young persons are drawn to working as runners, the police said on Thursday that youths tend to commit such offences for “fast cash”. For conducting harassment such as splashing paint or placing a bicycle lock at a debtor’s gate, the going rate can be S$300 to S$800 per job, though some are paid less, said officer-in-charge of the Bedok Police Division's Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Squad, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Michael Ho in an interview with the media. He pointed to a March 2020 case where four youths aged between 17 and 18 were caught for vandalising a house with paint and locking a gate with a bicycle lock. The youths in that case confessed to having committed the acts for “quick cash” and having learned about the job through a Telegram group called “SG Fast Cash”. They were offered S$100 as a group for this incident of harassment and eventually charged in court and sentenced to 21 months of probation. When asked if there was a noticeable trend of youths who commit such offences being from lower-income families, ASP Ho said that these youths typically come from a range of backgrounds. “Some of them come from better off families, but (they commit these offences) because of the attraction (of earning money) and the lifestyle, their daily expenditure, (as) they may spend more as compared to previously,” said Mr Ho. Lawyer Sanjiv Vaswani said that his firm Vaswani Law Chambers has also seen a “marked increase” in the number of enquiries from young persons charged with being debtors turned runners . This refers to individuals who cannot secure a credit line with a bank and so turn to online advertisements promising easy cash for a work-from-home opportunity, which can turn out to be “bait advertisements” for unlicensed moneylenders offering quick loans, said the former prosecutor. “Subsequently when it is time to repay and the borrower can’t keep up with payments, these unlicensed moneylenders will sometimes use these younger borrowers as their runners to harass some of their bigger clients,” he added. The authorities said that they are monitoring the evolving landscape of unlicensed moneylending, and are working with various stakeholders to address new methods of harassment. Senior Investigation Officer of the Criminal Investigation Department’s Unlicensed Moneylending Strike Force, Inspector Ong Tiam Huat, highlighted a February 2024 case where a woman was charged in court for using her TikTok account to promote and advertise an illegal moneylending business. “The police work closely with all the relevant stakeholders, including social media platforms to tackle the online unlicensed moneylending activities, and we’ll continue to take tough enforcement action against those involved in loansharking activities,” he added. While the evolution of the unlicensed moneylending space to the digital realm has made tracking the perpetrators and syndicates more difficult, officer-in-charge of the Criminal Investigation Department’s Unlicensed Moneylending Strike Force, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Alvin Li, said the police go through training to understand how these platforms work and the measures needed to curb criminal activity. With the strict laws and enforcement here, unlicensed moneylending syndicates have “shifted overseas” and syndicate members maintain a “high level of secrecy”, DSP Li said. “It makes it challenging, or even impossible for us to uncover their identities. Witnesses fear reprisal to themselves and family members should the syndicate members come to know that they provided information to the authorities,” he added, stating that some witnesses can turn “hostile” and refuse to cooperate with police investigations. He shared an example of a “towkay”, or financier of an overseas unlicensed moneylender syndicate, who operated “behind the scenes” and was dealt with under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act in 2019 after the police tracked the syndicate for over three years. The Act is a decades-long law that allows the detention of people linked to certain criminal activities, including secret societies and unlicensed moneylending, without trial. DSP Li said this syndicate was linked to over 1,800 reported cases of harassment here, but prosecution of the man was “not viable” as borrowers were unable to identify him and syndicate members were afraid of testifying against him. “We had to work with foreign law enforcement agencies to locate him and process his coordination back to Singapore,” said DSP Li. “The unlicensed moneylending syndicates will continue to evolve and exploit the easiest ways to harass borrowers and their families. They will stop at nothing. We will continue to monitor the trend, the tactics, and work with the various stakeholders to disrupt their activities, and identify and prosecute these offenders.” In terms of public education efforts, the police also conduct anti-unlicensed money lending talks during outreach efforts to “vulnerable groups” such as migrant workers, students and volunteers from non-governmental organisations, said Insp Ong. During school engagements, the authorities will highlight the seriousness of getting involved with unlicensed moneylending activities and the consequences by law of engaging in such actions. The authorities also engage with young offenders' parents during the course of investigations, and refer them to other resources such as counsellors through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, said ASP Ho of Bedok Police Division. \"We will talk to parents and try to understand more. Let's say if the youth is rebellious or always asking their parents for money, through talking to parents we will ... see how to help them and refer them to the appropriate resources for the future.\" Despite the well-documented horror stories about victims of loan sharks, illegal moneylenders will continue to exist in some form simply because there is demand for them, said experts. Associate Professor of Sociology Alwyn Lim from SMU said: “Illegal money lending indicates to us that in this society, there is much more of a demand for liquidity than actually exists, that is, things seem to need a lot of money. “As long as the demand for liquidity exceeds the supply, there will be an illegal industry that forms around it. If our society wants to tackle that, we have to get to the roots of what is causing that.” Mr Josephus Tan, managing director of Invictus Law and a criminal lawyer who has represented clients as young as 14 in such cases, noted that many of his cases were done pro bono for the “down and out” who became involved with loan sharks because of their financial or family circumstances. He recalled a case of a man who had borrowed money from loan sharks because he had no money to pay for his father’s funeral. In another case, a man with a failed small business who contracted cancer borrowed money from loan sharks to pay for his family's medical bills. To offset his debts, the loan sharks asked him to hand over his banking information to them. “People recruited by loan sharks are victims in their own right, either the young and ignorant who want to make a quick buck or those who owe the unlicensed moneylenders and are trapped in the vicious cycle (of assisting lenders),” said Mr Tan. One way to help people who are more likely to borrow from unlicensed sources is to introduce “targeted, contextualised” saving plans and financial literacy programmes for them, said Assoc Prof Razwana. She also suggested enhancing “financial inclusion” by increasing access to credit for low-income individuals, such as through microfinance and community banking initiatives. Mr Louis Chua, a Member of Parliament (MP) for Sengkang Group Representation Constituency, suggested that “ethical lending practices” should be encouraged, apart from raising awareness on the dangers of illicit borrowing. Strict regulations on all forms of lending, even from licensed moneylenders and banks, to prevent “exorbitant interest rates” and “highly misleading” charges should also be encouraged to protect borrowers, he added. “Beyond that, we should also establish stronger support systems for those in financial distress, offering a range of services from counselling, to emergency financial assistance and even debt restructuring programmes,” said Mr Chua. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, MP for Mountbatten Single Member Constituency, pointed to the various agencies that people can turn to. “Those who are from low-income backgrounds should also know that there are different available to assist them with their finances, for example, from Social Service Offices and Comcare,” he said. On the issue of young runners, Mr Melvin Yong, MP for Radin Mas Single Member Constituency, said that during his time as a police officer, he had come across many cases of unlicensed money lending and saw the impact it had on those involved, including youths recruited by loan sharks. This motivated him to create the bi-annual youth engagement programme, Delta League, in 2011, to engage youths through football and keep them “meaningfully occupied” during the school holidays. While illegal moneylending may seem impossible to eradicate, the question then is whether the same can be said of harassment of borrowers. Ms James noted that as many unlicensed moneylenders may be based overseas, it has become “trickier” for local authorities to catch them. Agreeing, Mr Vaswani noted that unlicensed moneylending is a criminal enterprise that is “borderless”, as the masterminds can “easily tap” people in Singapore to conduct harassment or lending of their personal bank accounts no matter where they are based. “We need to address the root of the problem — which is why do people have to borrow from such sources in the first place? Are people doing so to feed an addiction? “Or is it to feed their family, in which case the other question to ask is were there no other alternatives? Theoretically, if you strip away the need to borrow from such sources and you will slowly dismantle the unlicensed moneylending industry,” he said. Lawyers also noted that victims of loan-shark harassment are often caught in a “double bind”, given that borrowing from such lenders is also illegal. “They might fear getting in trouble themselves if they report the activity. As a result, even if they do come forward, they might be hesitant to provide the full details of the situation, hindering prosecution efforts,” said Ms James. “This lack of cooperation, stemming from a well-founded fear of violence and potential legal repercussions, makes it significantly harder to build strong cases against the lenders.” Still, lawyers said that cracking down on runners and illegal local lenders can curb the harassment problem. “Law enforcement can still put pressure on the unlicensed moneylender and their operations by taking strict action against the runners and local lenders, as well as seizing assets,” said Ms James. Mr Vaswani emphasised that the ubiquity of police cameras in housing estates has also gone a long way in the identification and tracing of suspects involved in loan shark harassment, and the freezing of bank accounts used for unlicensed moneylending activities can greatly hamper illegal moneylending operations. At the end of the day, reducing inequality is key to ending the “Ah Long” problem, said Assoc Prof Razwana. “As long as inequality exists, we will not be able to completely eradicate unlicensed money lenders. However, we could try to minimise the dependency and make it harder for them to operate.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Big Read SINGAPORE — For the last two years of his university studies, Mr Andrew William strategically scheduled his timetable to maximise most of his time outside class taking up internship stints. While educational institutes have long emphasised the importance of and helped students secure internships, students are growing increasingly hungry for more internship opportunities outside of school requirements. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For the last two years of his university studies, Mr Andrew William strategically scheduled his timetable to maximise most of his time outside class taking up internship stints. The now-23-year-old would pack his classes into two to three days, allowing him to work for the rest of the week. Weekends were spent in front of his computer, as he toiled for several startups and consultancy companies. In some semesters, he would take on two internships at once while juggling his studies at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). In total, the communication studies graduate completed 10 internships — although only one stint was a graduation requirement. The rest of the internship stints? Mr William, a Singapore permanent resident who graduated in 2022, had taken them up on his own initiative. Following two internships at an advertising firm and a public relations firm, Mr William felt that the industries did not suit him and decided to pursue a career in consultancy. “I spoke to some seniors who were working in consulting and learnt it would be quite difficult to pursue a career without a relevant degree,” he told TODAY. “I can’t change my major, but I also can’t break into consulting if I remain status quo. So I got an internship at (market research firm) Euromonitor as a research consultant intern and slowly took up more internships in the industry.” To get these internships, Mr William joined his school's consultancy club — which provided networking opportunities. He also took part in case competitions to boost his portfolio. While arming himself with 10 internships might seem like overkill to an earlier generation of undergraduates, Mr William — who now works as a management consultant at an American consultancy firm — is part of a growing number of students who have joined the “rat race” for internships even before completing their paper chase at universities and polytechnics. Ten university and polytechnic students who spoke to TODAY said they had taken on at least three internship stints for several reasons: Getting more real-world learning experiences, earning pocket money and hoping to increase their chances of securing a better job after graduation. But getting an internship in well-known companies is no walk in the park, be it for Singaporean students here or overseas, where the pursuit of multiple internships is also common. CNN reported in 2019 that tech giant Google received 125,000 applications for its internship programme that year in the United States. At investment banking firm Goldman Sachs, 236,000 students applied for its internships in 2022 globally — of which reportedly 1.5 per cent were given a role. An internship opportunity with Formula One motor-racing team Red Bull also drew “thousands” of Singapore-based applicants earlier this year, of which just two students snagged the internship. The competition for internships has even spurred international businesses to tout their ability to help students secure coveted internship opportunities in the investment banking and consulting industries for a fee. One such business based in Hong Kong, called IBankCoaching, states on its website that it provides job tracking support for internships and “insider tips” to ace interviews with companies such as Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and DBS. The company claims that it can help students “to get into investment banking in London, Singapore and Hong Kong”, but did not state how much its services cost. It also lists what is said to be the internship pay at various financial institutions in Singapore, with monthly salaries ranging from S$1,300 to S$13,000. TODAY takes a deeper look at why students in Singapore vie for internships, the competition for these positions and some implications of this rat race among youths even before they step into the working world. Most institutes of higher learning require students to go through an internship as part of their graduation requirements. Temasek Polytechnic’s director of student support and career services Samuel Wee said that internships allow students to establish connections with professionals and peers in their field and gain “valuable insights, guidance and potential job prospects”. “Internships can also provide students an informed evaluation on whether their field of study is one they hope to pursue through future education or employment, as internships give students a first-hand experience of the scope of work, processes, and expectations in his or her industry.” Like most educational institutions, Temasek Polytechnic partners industry players to provide internship opportunities for its students and “many employers view internships as a pipeline for talent acquisition”, said Mr Wee. Industry partners are required to provide a training programme, project outline, job scope and learning outcomes prior to the internship among other things, he added. This allows the school to match the internship to the right student based on their specialisation. Ms Louisa Lau, director of Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Office of Immersion and Careers, added that the polytechnic has education and career coaches who run clinics and coaching sessions to “help students build their confidence when applying for internships and enhance their employability”, among other initiatives to help prepare students for these work stints. She added that the school is “progressively introducing” year-long internships and dual internships which allow students to embark on more than one graded internship during their course of study. This is to “provide more opportunities for students to broaden their industry exposure” — something students are increasingly looking for. Like other tertiary institutions, Ngee Ann Polytechnic has seen more students interested in pursuing multiple internships, said Ms Lau. Ms Prasanthi Guda, senior deputy director of the Dato’ Kho Hui Meng Career Centre at Singapore Management University (SMU), told TODAY that its students take on an average of 2.6 internships. This is more than the single internship SMU students are required to go through to graduate. “Students are seeking diversity in their experience across industries before they graduate to be able to make informed decisions about full-time jobs,” said Ms Prasanthi. “Even within a particular sector, the differences in companies that operate in the space may be useful for graduates to observe and learn best practices. So, multiple internships are recommended in general for all young people to build a strong foundation for their future careers.” While these institutions have many internship programmes in place, some students told TODAY that they also seek out internships on their own — to the extent of attending multiple networking sessions and going through several rounds of interviews with the companies they are eyeing. Take for example third-year SMU student Koh Liang Jun, 24, who participated in a case competition for the chance to intern at global professional services firm Accenture — which he described as the most “tedious” way to get an internship. In a case competition, students are given a business case study to solve within a set time in teams. Typical prizes include cash and a possible internship opportunity. “Companies are finding different methods to get talents… such as through case competition where people can showcase their knowledge,” said Mr Koh, who is currently on his fourth internship stint as an automation intern at a bank. Another Singaporean student, Ms Noreen Shazreen, may be pursuing her degree in arts and communications at the University of Western Australia in Perth — but she is still caught in the internship race. Wanting to gain experience and increase her chances of getting a good job at a global company, the 22-year-old has been searching for an internship in Australia and Singapore. While she had been offered unpaid internships, Ms Noreen did not accept them as she did not want to provide “free labour” — especially since she has prior experience interning at two government agencies in Singapore and is freelancing as a writer and managing social media accounts. Not wanting to miss out on any time to intern, Ms Noreen has been searching for an internship opportunity in Singapore while she is back in the country for the first time since she started her university studies. To do so, she has not only canvassed job listings — but also searched for the hiring managers’ social media platforms to drop them a private message in the hope of increasing her chances of getting an internship opportunity. As for second-year National University of Singapore (NUS) business administration student Ryan Ong, sitting through several rounds of interviews was all worth it when he secured his fourth internship at a travel startup in Vietnam called LFG. What made the process smoother was that Mr Ong had met the startup's founder during a networking session a few months prior. Having left a good impression, Mr Ong's request to intern for LFG was quickly approved, he said. Barely a month into his internship now, the 26-year-old told TODAY he has plans for a fifth internship later in the year — in New York. Mr Ong was able to snag the two internships in Vietnam and New York because he is part of the highly competitive NUS Overseas College programme. The programme, which gives NUS students the opportunity to intern overseas at a startup, involves rounds of interviews to get into, followed by another round of interviews with several startups to secure the internship. Mr Ong, who also runs mental health support group The Catalyst Collective, said that while he has taken on the internships mainly to gain real-world experience and try out different careers, peer influence also plays a role. “There’s a lot of pressure to take on internships because I see people around me taking on multiple internships. Some are even doing it part- time, building and using connections to get these opportunities,” he said. Mr William, the consultant who took on 10 internships, acknowledged that he might be among those who have spurred the “rat race” that has made internship programmes more competitive. But he said it was a necessity as he wanted to pursue a career that differed from his studies. \"It's extremely difficult getting into the top three consulting firms as there's so much competition globally,\" said Mr William of firms such as Bain and Company, McKinsey and Company and Boston Consulting Group. \"You really have to stand out, and do above and beyond to get your foot through the door for that interview opportunity.\" For 22-year-old Vera Lim, taking on seven internships over the past three years was to satisfy her curiosity about different jobs while getting a small allowance. The NUS business administration student is currently a client and markets intern for professional services network Deloitte. She started her internship journey with startups, before securing stints with bigger companies like Deloitte and management consultancy BCG X. “There’s a lot of people around me that take on more than five internships since it's so competitive... But I know that I’m definitely fuelling the rat race by taking on so many internships. “It is tough to make it out in the working world and this (internship) is one way to stand out,” Ms Lim said. But despite her lengthy resume, which also includes running a fitness start-up and volunteer work, Ms Lim has been rejected by multiple banks and large corporations when applying for internships. She has also taken on an unpaid internship, while another part-time internship was for S$300 a month. \"I took them for the experience and just wanted to try my hand at something new,\" she explained. Ms Noreen, the 22-year-old Singaporean studying in Australia, told TODAY she has been told by some companies that they did not pay interns as the interns \"gained more than the company\". But not all interns go unpaid though — schools often have a recommended allowance. At NUS, the recommended allowance is at least S$800 to S$1,000. Students who spoke to TODAY said they were paid, on average, between S$800 and S$1,500 per month. Some investment banking firms however offer much higher pay for interns, at rates roughly similar to the starting pay of fresh graduates in certain roles. The Business Times reported in 2017 that the monthly internship pay can be up to S$10,000 at firms like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Mr Felix Tan, founder and chief executive officer of skills-based hiring platform Skilio, told TODAY that he has seen some university students map out a “four-year internship roadmap” on the types of companies they want to intern at during their studies. With many companies moving away from hiring just based on academic grades, Mr Tan said that internships have become not just valuable in helping youths stand out from other candidates when vying for a job — but a necessity. Agreeing, Mr Rob Wisdom, director and head of supply chain of recruitment firm Ethos Beathchapman, added that internships can help students identify skill deficits, strengthen their technical abilities and validate their career choices. Beyond that, these opportunities also allow them to make career changes and gain expert knowledge from mentors. \"(Internships can also) be a springboard for entry into the permanent job ladder and even potentially help you command a slightly higher starting salary. “Amid today's job market uncertainty, it is also good advice to ensure valuable use of all your time. In this sense many internships can be value adding and help pave the way into full-time employment.” Mr Wisdom added that prestigious internships with multinational companies, big brands or forward-thinking companies are attractive on a fresh graduate’s resume. “These internships are definitely of value as they are often competitive to get and increasingly are scrutinised by governments or certain bodies to ensure they are not exploitative and give the intern good exposure,” he said. Highly reputable company names — such as Google, Meta and JP Morgan — are also keywords that get flagged by job application tracking systems. These systems, which recruiters and employers use to manage job applicants, might rank candidates with such coveted internships higher — meaning they have a higher chance of getting an interview with the respective companies. Amid this new rat race, what should students focus on in getting the most out of their work stints? Mr Kenji Naito, group chief executive officer of recruitment agency Reeracoen, said that students should “focus on internships that offer meaningful work, learning opportunities, and professional growth rather than simply accumulating numbers”. This is because when a company is hiring a candidate, it looks at what they had done during their internships and how they had performed. So what are the attributes of a good, quality internship? A good quality internship would be structured with clear objectives and learning outcomes, said Mr Naito. There should also be access to mentors who provide guidance and feedback, as well as assignments that challenge and develop the intern’s skill sets. “Companies should also offer feedback through regular performance reviews to help interns grow… and provide exposure to different aspects of the business,” he added. Mr Wisdom said it is important to identify some of the things that interns want from their internship programme. “For example, do you know if your personality suits a corporate or small company environment? Or, often had an itch for a certain role but not sure? Scratch it with an internship,” he said. “Employees are undeniably far more successful, happy and value adding in roles and environments that fit them well.” Company reviews and testimonials from former interns may also help students to decide if a particular internship is suitable for them. Educational institutions told TODAY that they take steps to ensure that internship programmes with companies they partner provide students with enough depth and experiences. The students are also equipped with interview skills and resume tips taught by education and career coaches which can help them secure internship opportunities, said Ms Lau from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Students told TODAY that they also found networking to be a useful tool in discovering internship opportunities and securing them — noting they have had friends getting internships through their social circles. “Internships are also networking opportunities since you can build connections with people in the industry,” said Mr Wong Wai Fai, 25, a NUS final-year business administration student. Such links have allowed him to learn about different internship opportunities, beyond learning more about the industry itself. Like other students, Mr Wong, who is an e-commerce marketing intern at Sony Electronics, also used professional social media platform LinkedIn to network with people in the industry. While taking on multiple internships at a time seems to be par for course for a growing number of students, some youths told TODAY that it comes at a price: Less “me-time” and a toll on their mental well-being. “If all your summer holidays are used for internship and you don’t get a proper break, you don’t get the chance to be a student,” said Mr Ong, the NUS business administration student interning in Vietnam now. “It’s not really healthy to be in this perpetual state of grinding and hustling it out… not forgetting you’re just going to be doing that for the rest of your career.” For Mr Ong, he finds time to take on volunteer work, and also runs his mental health support group — which has helped him gain opportunities to intern in the social impact industry which he is interested in pursuing. Taking on internships outside of a school curriculum also puts students at risk of taking on stints that proved to be bad experiences, where they were either overworked or asked to do menial tasks such as picking up coffee orders. In Ms Lim's case, the NUS student had taken on a part-time internship but found herself working more days and hours than she agreed upon. Juggling her studies and taking on more job scopes than agreed, she later fell sick. Despite being on medical leave, she was asked to complete certain job tasks which she complied with. While most educational institutions pair students with a mentor or career coach who can help manage company expectations during an internship, youths may not have access to such resources when taking on their own gigs. “I just dealt with it as there wasn't much I could do but suck it up,” said Ms Lim of her experience. “It was extremely stressful but I learnt how to set proper boundaries following the incident.” She is not the only one with a bad internship experience. Several netizens took to online forum Reddit to discuss their intern “ horror stories ” last month — including one user who worked at a Singapore firm that had interns do most of the human resource work, and another who would run errands for their boss. The competition for internships also raises questions about whether it is a level playing field for students who do not have social or professional network in a particular industry. NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser noted that students who have larger social networks would have better access to opportunities and the relevant information. “In short, connections matter, even in a meritocracy,” said Assoc Prof Tan. “This is not to argue that ability in terms of knowledge and skills isn’t important, but that it has to be ability in terms of networking skills or ability which enables one to be recognised by people with power and connections who would recommend one to others in their social networks.” Because of this, lacking connections could translate into internship inequalities — and that would also apply to job opportunities too. This could be alleviated by providing students with more opportunities to network and increasing mentorship programmes, said Assoc Prof Tan. Companies could also look at placing more value on different student programmes and achievements when assessing their candidates — such as volunteer work, leadership positions in co-curricular activities and more. Looking back, Ms Lim said she might have taken a different approach when applying for internships if given a second chance. “At the beginning, I was ‘job hopping’ to find my place and interest,” she said, pointing to the array of internships she had done. These included working for a venture capital, organising events and trying her hand out as a marketing intern. “There are much more targeted approaches to taking internships, such as focusing on building up your skills for a particular industry, before taking on internships only within this industry.” Still, she described her internships as “maximising” her potential. “In the end, I’m just trying to do everything to the best of my ability. And through these internships, I can at least be confident that my job in the future fits me, fulfills me financially and has room for me to grow,” said Ms Lim.

SINGAPORE — Mr Alan had no idea that his employee had borrowed from “loan sharks” until he was harassed with almost 120 calls over three days from various unlicensed money lenders. The strategic consultant, who did not want to give his real name and spoke on condition of anonymity, discovered that his Singaporean employee had given Mr Alan’s name, personal phone number and the company's main line to the illegal moneylenders, listing him as a guarantor. “During the period where there was constant harassment, if you don’t pick up right away they will call back immediately. They don’t allow your phone to rest, so if other people try to call you they cannot get through,” said Mr Alan, who is in his 50s. He immediately terminated the man’s contract for placing his office and other colleagues “at risk” and advised his staff on how to field calls searching for the former employee. While this happened in 2017, Mr Alan received a call from a stranger looking for his ex-employee last year. Mr Alan’s brush with “Ah Longs” — a colloquial term derived from the Cantonese phrase for illegal moneylenders — despite him not having borrowed a cent from them is not unique. In recent years, unlicensed money lenders have used both time-tested and less conventional methods to force their borrowers to pay up — from harassing the latter’s employers to using social media to scare and shame debtors and engaging “runners” to intimidate them. Mr Sebastian Pereira, a sales manager and delivery rider on Foodpanda, also had a taste of another loan-shark tactic when he was out on a delivery last year. The 51-year-old said “nothing looked amiss” when he picked up a cash-on-delivery order for fishball noodles in Pasir Ris. Upon arriving at the drop-off location in Bedok, however, he found more than 10 other delivery riders from various platforms congregating at the void deck for orders to the same address, who informed him it was a “loan shark case” and that no one at the address had actually ordered the food. “It’s another way of harassing the victims, because the loan sharks themselves don’t want to be caught. Especially (harassment tactics) like paint and graffiti, those people can be caught. But food delivery, you don’t know who they are,” said Mr Pereira. Some lawyers told TODAY that they have seen more cases of teenagers or youths being recruited by these illegal moneylenders as their runners, while the police said on Thursday (June 20) that they have also seen an increase in the proportion of youth arrested for unlicensed money lending activities. From January to May 2024, 8.6 per cent of unlicensed money lending arrests involved youths between the ages of 14 and 19, a spike from 3.1 per cent for the corresponding period in 2023. A search of police news releases by TODAY found at least 67 reported cases of individuals being arrested for allegedly helping loan sharks in the past six months. Many of the cases involved teenagers caught for alleged loanshark harassment, including a 14-year-old who was arrested on June 5, for suspected involvement in setting a fire outside a flat at Yishun Avenue 6. Since January this year, at least three islandwide operations have been conducted to suppress unlicensed moneylending activities, with over 100 persons being investigated on each occasion for allegedly harassing debtors at their homes, carrying out bank transfers and providing banking information to facilitate unlicensed money lending business. On June 8, the police said that 128 persons aged between 14 and 73 were being investigated for their suspected involvement in unlicensed moneylending activities, following a five-day islandwide operation in May. On Friday, Ng Kwong Seng, a Singaporean man who rose through the ranks to become a “towkay” (boss) for an illegal moneylending syndicate based in China, was sentenced to 51 months' jail and a fine of S$495,000. For 13 years, Ng had worked for the syndicate, which charged Singapore borrowers 20 per cent interest for loans. Before the dawn of the digital age, spraying paint and locking gates were among the unlicensed moneylenders’ favourite tools of the trade. Today, loan sharks have adapted with the increasing use of social media not only to harass debtors — but also to advertise and contact potential borrowers, such as through unsolicited messages boasting fast approval loans. One victim of such harassment was Ms Ika Lestari, 40, whose former helper had borrowed money from unlicensed moneylenders . The teacher recounted to TODAY how despite blocking many phone numbers that sent threatening messages, the loan sharks still managed to track her down via social media. They took screenshots of public photos of her face and sent them to her with messages such as “Is this you?” and issued other threats such as “I go your house because you block me (sic)”. Ms Gloria James, head lawyer at Gloria James Civetta and Co, added: “They may also contact neighbours, family members, co-workers and employers online in an attempt to cause harassment and to embarrass the borrowers.” As for recruitment of borrowers and runners, messaging platform Telegram has been a “game changer” in the past five years, said lawyer Kalidass Murugaiyan, who has worked with young offenders between the age of 16 and 22. “Around 10 to 15 years ago, (recruitment) used to be on websites. There were popular forums where these (listings) were posted, but now it’s gone even deeper, because it’s on Telegram. If you go to Telegram and type ‘Sell ATM card’, you might get something,” said Mr Kalidass from Kalidass Law Corporation. As for why young persons are drawn to working as runners, the authorities said youths tend to commit loan shark harassment for “fast cash”. The going rate can be between S$300 to S$800 per job, though some are paid less, said officer-in-charge of the Anti-Unlicensed Moneylending Squad at Bedok Police Division, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Michael Ho. When asked if there was a noticeable trend of youths who commit unlicensed money lender related offences coming from lower-income families, ASP Ho said that these youths typically come from a range of backgrounds. “Some of them come from better off families, but (they commit these offences) because of the attraction (of earning money) and the lifestyle, their daily expenditure, (as) they may spend more as compared to previously,” said Mr Ho. Despite the well-documented horror stories about victims of loan sharks, illegal moneylenders will continue to exist in some form simply because there is demand for them, said experts. Associate Professor Razwana Begum, head of the public safety and security programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that those who borrow from unlicensed moneylenders are likely to be in the lower-income bracket. Gig workers, who may be living “day by day” on an unstable income with no savings may also be at “higher risk” of seeking financial assistance from unlicensed moneylenders, said Assoc Prof Razwana, who is also a Nominated Member of Parliament. Mr Josephus Tan, managing director of Invictus Law and a criminal defence lawyer who has represented clients as young as 14 in such cases, noted that many of his cases were done pro bono for the “down and out” who became involved with loan sharks because of their financial or family circumstances. In one case, a man with a failed small business who contracted cancer borrowed money from loan sharks to pay for his family's medical bills. To offset his debts, the loan sharks asked him to hand over his banking information to them. “People recruited by loan sharks are victims in their own right, either the young and ignorant who want to make a quick buck or those who owe the unlicensed moneylenders and are trapped in the vicious cycle (of assisting lenders),” said Mr Tan. Thus, experts and Members of Parliament who spoke to TODAY urged for a multi-pronged approach to tackle the issue of loan sharks, including stepping up public education efforts to boost financial literacy and curb the recruitment of runners. One way to help people who are more likely to borrow from unlicensed sources is to introduce “targeted, contextualised” saving plans and financial literacy programmes for them, said Assoc Prof Razwana. While illegal moneylending may seem impossible to eradicate, the question then is whether the same can be said of harassment of borrowers. With tough anti-unlicensed moneylending laws here, some of the people and syndicates behind such illicit activities have also shifted overseas and are able to operate remotely. This and the evolving landscape of online methods of harassment, to include the use of food delivery platforms or social media to harass borrowers, has made it more difficult to catch the culprits, who can hide their identities. However, the authorities are working with various stakeholders, including social media platforms, to take “tough enforcement action” against those involved in loansharking activities, said Senior Investigation Officer of the Criminal Investigation Department’s Unlicensed Moneylending Strike Force, Inspector Ong Tiam Huat. Lawyers also said that cracking down on runners and seizing assets can help to make the illegal business less attractive, and place pressure on unlicensed moneylenders. For example, arresting and prosecuting runners and lenders can “significantly disrupt” the unlicensed moneylenders' ability to recruit victims, collect debts and harass their borrowers, said Ms James. At the end of the day, reducing inequality is key to ending the ‘Ah Long’ problem, said Assoc Prof Razwana. “As long as inequality exists, we will not be able to completely eradicate unlicensed money lenders. However, we could try to minimise the dependency and make it harder for them to operate.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Ms Lee Wen-yi with her novel The Dark We Know, which she wrote during the Covid-19 pandemic. The book has been picked up by famous American mystery writer Gillian Flynn. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Budding author Lee Wen-yi, 24, is about to burst onto the global publishing scene thanks in part to Covid-19 lockdowns when she spent long hours writing about her emotions of grief and loss. The Singaporean's young adult novel The Dark We Know is to be published on Aug 13 after being picked up by famous American mystery author Gillian Flynn, best known for books such as Gone Girl, which became a hit Hollywood movie in 2014 starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike. Ms Lee, who works as a full-time project manager in the publishing industry here, told TODAY that she has landed a book deal with Gillian Flynn Books for her debut young adult novel. She declined to give more details. She said that she is now focused on an adult fantasy-historical novel, slated to be published next year, set in 1970s Singapore about an all-girl gang. Ms Lee's debut young adult novel is about a teenage art student who has to return to her haunted small town. The student reunites with her estranged childhood best friend to fight a supernatural evil force that killed two of their friends two years earlier. Speaking to TODAY, Ms Lee described the novel as one that encompassed themes of grief and loss inspired by the song Those You've Known from the musical Spring Awakening. The coming-of-age musical that delves into dark themes involving teenage sexuality, pregnancy and mental health first debuted on Broadway in America in 2006. Ms Lee said: \"It was something that I needed at the time and was thinking about at the time — the sense of the people that you've lost sort of continuing with you and giving you strength, and how to move on despite everything that you've faced.\" She felt an affinity to Spring Awakening because she was supposed to have produced the musical during her final year at University College London where she studied liberal arts, when Covid-19 struck. Left saddened as she played songs from the musical on repeat, she tweeted on how she craved for more content that would make her feel the way Spring Awakening did. That was when she realised that she could create that for herself. \"I started thinking about it and, like, 24 hours later, I more or less had an idea for the book, which was a horror speculative retelling of Spring Awakening,\" she added. Speculative fiction is an umbrella term covering genres such as fantasy and science fiction. As she yearned for a career in speculative fiction, Ms Lee decided to try out where the young adult book markets were the biggest. To get her book published, she needed to first get representation from a book agent who would then help her to send her manuscript to publishing houses. Ms Lee said that she had sent pitches and sample pages of her novel to a total of 47 agents. Of those, 16 book agents asked to see her full manuscript, and four offered her representation. Having been associated with the online American publishing space for over a year, Ms Lee had picked up tips on how to pitch a book, what kinds of books were being published and where her book would sit within the young adult fiction market. After getting representation, Ms Lee's book agent sent her manuscript to both adult and young adult publishing houses. This was because Ms Lee felt that her book had been written in a mature voice that would appeal to both adults and young adults. She ultimately decided to market The Dark We Know as a young adult novel. \"I was really very much writing it as a coming-of-age story for who I was as a teenager and other teenagers whom I hoped the story spoke to,\" she said. Her book was sold to Gillian Flynn Books in October 2022, one year after she completed writing. This offer came as a shock to Ms Lee because she did not know her book agent had sent her manuscript to Gillian Flynn. \"I was actually on a work trip at the time and had to sneak away from meetings to find a random corner in the expo hall where I could take a call with my agent,\" she recalled. Receiving that call was a pivotal moment in her writing journey. The agent said that Gillian Flynn had not only read and loved the story, but also wanted to publish it. \"It was a complete surprise and I love Gillian's books, but just hearing that she wanted to publish my book also made me panic for a while as I started to overthink... wondering if my book was good and if there was anything I could fix,\" Ms Lee said with a laugh. An early version of her debut novel was shared with authors Ms Lee admired, who lavished praise on the book. This is to be included as blurbs on the back of her published book. Recalling the moment she learnt of her book deal, Ms Lee said: \"I was thrilled and very, very grateful. It was so amazing that so many cool writers all came through and it was a relief that they didn't hate it.\" When she told her parents about her six-figure deal for her upcoming second book, her mother congratulated her before asking her how much of it would be lost to American taxes. \"I think they've seen me writing since I was a kid so this didn't come as the biggest surprise. \"My parents are happy for me but they will still do the practical nagging about not quitting my job or to manage my money wisely.\" Even though her penchant for writing made it easy for her to churn out the first draft of her novel in a month, the overall process was not without its challenges, especially when she had to make revisions to her draft. \"Because it is quite a heavy book that deals with depression and grief, I would notice that whenever I went back to the book, I would get into this sort of headspace that wasn't the most healthy for me,\" she said. So, whenever revisions had to be made, Ms Lee always had to make sure that she would be able to put the book down and go do something that was not quite as heavy. Another challenge that she had to grapple with was learning to let go of sole control of her book because once it gets into a publishing house, it becomes a team effort. \"Everyone will have an opinion so the book is not really just yours anymore,\" she said. \"As a debut novelist, a big part of the process was learning how to navigate this and learn how to sort of let go of the book and find a way to sort of reconcile that.\" Even as she counts down the days till her book release, Ms Lee is aware of uncertainty over whether her book will do well in an already crowded young adult fiction market. However, she believes that there will be readers who will find her book and read it. \"The book touches on a lot of hurt and ultimately, I wrote the book towards healing so I think that if the hope and healing reaches someone, then I've done what I set out to.\" As she gears up for the release of her novel and the impending publication of the adult novel in 2025, Ms Lee shared a few words of advice for budding authors who are looking to get published like her. \"Don't be afraid to write what you want and finish that book. Make sure you are writing something that you love and want to see through because you cannot go anywhere without having that.\" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that Ms Lee landed a six-figure book deal for her debut young adult novel. This is incorrect. Her six-figure book deal is for her upcoming second novel. We are sorry for the error.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Drinking a glass of water is an act that most people do not give a second thought to, but for 25-year-old Sherry Toh, it is a task that takes her exactly 52 seconds to complete. (From left) Spinal muscular atrophy patients Zayn Nabeel Abdat, Sherry Toh and Devdan Devaraj. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Drinking a glass of water is an act that most people do not give a second thought to, but for 25-year-old Sherry Toh, it is a task that takes her exactly 52 seconds to complete. Since she was diagnosed with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as an infant at 13 months old, she has struggled with even the simplest tasks because the congenital neuromuscular disorder, which is characterised by the loss of motor neurons, leads to muscle weakness and atrophy. Most patients are unable to stand or sit unsupported, and as the disease worsens, they have problems swallowing, speaking and breathing. Ms Toh, who spends most of her time on the sofa, needs cushions to prop up her head and back. She found some respite recently through the drug Evrysdi. Apart from no longer being out of breath when speaking or getting through daily tasks such as typing, she took just 16 seconds to finish that cup of water — almost the same speed as an average adult. This marked improvement in her condition, however, was short-lived. When her crowdfunding campaign to pay for the costly drug did not hit its target of S$375,000 to pay for a year’s supply, the drug’s manufacturer Roche donated a three-month supply to her in May last year. She took her last dose of the drug in September last year. “I’m very out of breath when I drink water now,” she said of one of her many struggles. Her crowdfunding campaign is still up more than a year later but has raised just S$89,425 — 23 per cent of her goal. Her doctor can only prescribe her the drug when she can pay for at least half a year’s supply of the drug. Research has shown that patients only show improvement after six months of taking the drug. Ms Toh said that she does not want whatever money she has raised to go to waste and if she does not meet the target, she will donate it to another SMA patient. SMA is a rare disease with 40 to 50 people suffering from it here. The condition made headlines in the last few years due to several crowdfunding campaigns to bring in Zolgensma — one of the world’s most expensive drugs — to help at least four babies diagnosed with the condition. There is no cure, but there are treatments that can improve patients’ quality of life and the Health Sciences Authority now approves the use of Spinraza, Evrysdi , and the gene therapy Zolgensma, although these drugs are not subsidised. Zolgensma, which was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2019, is a one-time therapy that must be administered before the patient turns two years old. In Singapore, it costs S$2.4 million and must be paid up in full before administration. Prices vary globally, generally around S$2.7 million to S$2.8 million in the US and Europe , but in Australia, the treatment is fully covered under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For Evrysdi, an oral medication taken daily to increase the production of a protein that SMA patients lack, it costs about S$375,000 for a year's supply. Spinraza, which needs to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid and requires a hospital stay, costs between S$845,480 and S$1.1 million for four injections in the first year and then S$507,000 for three doses in subsequent years. There is some hope for sufferers, though, with the Agency for Care Effectiveness on June 4 recommending that the Medication Assistance Fund subsidise drugs such as Evrysdi from Aug 1. The agency, which was set up by the Ministry of Health (MOH), is the national health technology assessment and clinical guidance agency. Following the agency's recommendations, MOH will review the matter. TODAY has reached out to the ministry to find out whether Evrysdi will be subsidised from August. Until that happens, Ms Toh wants to continue finding ways to fund her medication, adding that she has “many dreams she wants to accomplish.” Recently, her work as a video games journalist earned her a coveted spot at the Game Awards’ Future Class programme last year, which recognises leaders in the video game industry. Those selected will have opportunities for networking, career development and will get to attend workshops and panels. The programme picks just 50 applicants out of thousands every year, and Ms Toh is the sole Singaporean participant this year. She hopes to work in video game development and create a game that can help others feel like they are seen for more than their disabilities. “There are still options. There is hope and a way to stall the progression of your disability, and even to reverse some of the effects, you still have options. There are still things to do and live for,\" she said. Even though she is relieved that families with babies who have SMA were able to receive the donations they needed, Ms Toh feels “left behind”. “I don’t know if it’s that people just haven’t heard my story or if it’s got something to do with the fact that babies are cuter,” she said of the inability to raise money for her condition. Even though fundraising was a “nerve-racking” experience, parents of children with SMA told TODAY that seeing how well their children have responded to these expensive medications made it worth their while. The treatment is not a cure for the condition, but it has given patients a better quality of life, allowing them to lead a close to “normal” life. For example, before receiving the gene therapy, Ms Shuwen Devaraj's son Devdan, who was diagnosed with Type 2 SMA at seven months old, found it difficult to feed himself, she said. He had to constantly lower his head to his spoon since he did not have enough strength in his arms to lift the spoon to his mouth and had hand tremors. Ms Devaraj said that five-year-old Devdan is now “getting really strong”. From not being able to lift the spoon to his mouth, he can now wheel himself around in a wheelchair. “He’s growing up like a normal child; he’s just weak in walking, but he has gained some independence,” she added. She remembered the trepidation she felt after doctors from National University Hospital told her it would cost S$2.9 million for him to get Zolgensma. This amount seemed staggering for the interior designer and her civil service husband, both 36, to come up with on their own. She had heard of other fundraising bids that did not raise enough money or were met with scepticism by the public where some donors insisted on getting their donations back. Still, she knew that she had to try because Zolgensma had been dubbed the “miracle drug” for young patients of SMA. She contacted the online fundraising platform Ray of Hope as a last-ditch effort because Devdan was already nearing his second birthday. “I probably didn’t sleep for those ten days,” Ms Devara said. “I didn’t know there were so many kind people in this world. I think it has changed me and changed my life.” After a crowdfunding campaign that raised S$2.87 million in 10 days, Devdan received Zolgensma in September 2021. While the boy will not require any long-term medication, he attends physiotherapy sessions at a private clinic, which costs about S$240 an hour. During the first two years of receiving Zolgensma, Devdan attended these sessions a few times a week to build his strength. His parents said that they had to reduce their household expenses to pay for his physiotherapy sessions. Data centre specialist Nabeel Abdat, 32, and homemaker Syahirah Yakub, 33, similarly had to raise money for their son Zayn to receive Zolgensma. Zayn was diagnosed with SMA Type 1 , the most severe form of the disorder, when he was barely a month old​​​​. “It was a tough journey because we started in mid-August (in 2022), and we only got the funds about October, and the medication only came in about late November that year,” Mr Nabeel said. “Every day was nerve-racking because we explored every possible means to get the word out there.\" “We were very desperate,” Ms Syahirah said, adding that at the time, they were overextending on their credit cards to pay S$15,000 for a bottle of Evrysdi because Zayn’s condition deteriorated while they were fundraising. “We were just thinking, what would happen if this were to happen to someone who just doesn’t have that kind of money?” Ms Syahirah asked. “It’s quite critical. Every minute is ticking, so we need the drugs as soon as possible.” Ms Syahirah suggested that if there was some kind of government subsidy, it would not leave parents in this situation “hanging”. “The doctor predicted that Zayn can’t even sit on his own and only make minimal movements. But now, he can sit on his own for five minutes and he’s also learning how to walk and stand on his own.” These improvements have renewed hope in Mr Nabeel and Ms Syahirah that their son may lead a more independent life that many children who have SMA Type 1 without treatment might not be able to do. They are looking forward to one day taking him overseas for a holiday. “At this stage, Zayn is like in between a Type 1 and Type 2 (for SMA) because he’s able to sit down where most type 1 patients are not able to,” Mr Nabeel said. “We’re not expecting him to run, but at least when he’s in the wheelchair, he can still stand up and have a few walks to maybe go to the toilet, that kind of thing.” With Zolgensma, his breathing has also improved — Zayn can now spend about 90 minutes off his ventilator a couple of times each day, compared to being on the ventilator constantly. “It’s like a small celebration for us,” Ms Syahirah said.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Walking by some of the outdoor street football hard courts in housing estates, one cannot help but wonder if they are falling out of favour with recreational football players and the young. A street football court at a public housing estate on North Bridge Road seen on May 6, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Walking by some of the outdoor street football hard courts in housing estates, one cannot help but wonder if they are falling out of favour with recreational football players and the young. Quite a few look like they have seen better days and in need of a spruce-up. Student Lee Kok Jun, 24, who has lived at least two decades in a public housing block located next to a football hard court, observed that in contrast to 10 years ago where people of all ages were using the facility, only a few children are seen playing there now and then these days. On weekdays, it is rare to see anyone using the court near Block 339 Clementi Avenue 5. On weekends, mostly children of primary school-going age would show up to kick around with a ball, Mr Lee said. A check with some residents, players and operators providing alternative pitches showed that there may be some factors contributing to the lack of use. They are: When TODAY visited the hard court near Mr Lee’s home on Clementi Avenue 5 on a weekday morning, it was empty and the flooring did not seem to be in the best condition. Retiree Patanannadan Aspatraja, 73, who lives in the same neighbourhood, agreed with Mr Lee, saying that he normally sees the hard court being used for kickabouts only during the weekends, and occasionally on weekday evenings. “Unless it is a school holiday, generally the usage rate on a weekday is really low,” Mr Aspatraja added. “This could possibly be caused by the noise complaints from the residents. The noise level is normally boisterous when there are people playing and may travel up to high-rise floors.” However, Madam Puteh Ahmad, 72, a housewife who has lived in the same neighbourhood for 45 years, said that there are usually sounds of balls being kicked and bouncing off the surrounding fence, but to her, it was not so bad that they warranted complaints. She noted that the number of people playing at the Clementi court has halved since the recent pandemic, adding that it is now mainly used by children having kickabouts about once a week. When contacted by TODAY, Jurong-Clementi Town Council said that this court has not been fully utilised primarily due to the demographic profile of residents in the area, which comprises mostly middle-aged and older residents. \"Recognising the importance of maintaining functional and safe communal spaces, the town council is committed to refurbishing the soccer court floor. “With the refurbishment, we hope to enhance its appeal and attract more users, fostering social engagement and inter-generational connections,” it added. The town council did not comment further when asked to elaborate on when the low utilisation began, what kind of social and inter-generational activities it is looking at, as well as the frequency and costs of refurbishing the court. At the end of last year, the public use of a hard court was in the news. Some residents in Bedok North approved of a short-term closing of a football hard court not just because of the noise but because of inconsiderate users who dirty the place and occupy it for other purposes. Member of Parliament Tan Kiat How, who is also Senior Minister of State for National Development, said at the time that residents’ profiles change, so their needs may be different and may prefer wanting inter-generational public space for them and their grandchildren. Over at another hard court in Aljunied Crescent, retail employee Nur Aisyah Afandy, 32, said that there were roughly at least two to three times more people using it about four years ago, before the pandemic struck. Another Aljunied Crescent resident who gave her name as just Mrs Chong, 52, said that the younger generation might have gotten used to staying indoors since the pandemic. This made the young turn more to playing with electronic gadgets , the housewife reckoned. When contacted, Marine Parade Town Council said that it does not keep any specific data on the use of the five street football courts under its purview — including the one at Aljunied Crescent — since they are open to the public for use without any charge. There are no plans to repurpose any of these courts for other uses. \"In recent years, the town council has also not received any feedback or complaints from residents regarding the use of the street soccer courts in our town,\" it added. In the North Bridge Road area, a resident living close to a hard court said that before the pandemic, there used to be street football competitions held there, but these slowly died down. Ms Suhaily Sohdi, a 47-year-old caregiver to her father and who has been in the estate for around 16 years, added: \"Sometimes, I see preschool teachers taking the school kids out there to play, but it is not for football, just free play or other type of games led by the teachers.” Mr Guntmar Kerbl, 41, who came from Austria and has lived in Singapore since 2001, said that the poor design and choices of material has led to the low usage of the court on North Bridge Road. The semi-retiree and former info-technology professional suggested that artificial grass or outdoor carpeting, instead of poorly painted concrete, would reduce risk of injury and noise. “Ultraviolet-resistant goal netting would last longer, a higher cross bar on the goal would also reduce injury.” When TODAY visited the site, the court had cracked flooring and torn goalpost nets. Mr Kerbl added that from what he had seen in the past, shortly after repair works for the court were done, it would start looking worn out again. Jalan Besar Town Council, which oversees this hard court, has not responded to queries by publication time. Separately, the needs of some segments of football enthusiasts are being served elsewhere. The emergence of artificial football pitches by providers has been drawing people who want some form of privacy and exclusivity to play in their own groups. When TODAY visited some artificial football pitches in Kovan on a weekday morning in May, there were two groups of players having a kickabout there. The eight pitches are managed by futsal venue operator Kick Off!. It charges an hourly rate of S$55 during off-peak hours and S$105 at peak hours. Off-peak hours are weekdays before 6pm. Peak hours include weekends and public holidays. Mr Jubilant Chew, a 22-year-old undergraduate, said that he goes to these \"astro turf\" pitches because they have a more “professional feel”. He has been playing football since he was around six years old, he added, but he has never played at an outdoor street football court before. He now plays with a group of close friends about once a week. “With the (artificial) grass surface, I think the risk of injury is lower as well. I do not mind paying for the additional cost as we are able to split the cost among 10 to 15 players.” He added: “Generally, the football scene in Singapore is becoming quite developed with grassroots football and academies being more accessible, so I think there has been a shift from casual, leisure play to a lot more organised football such as this.” Marketing manager and boxing coach Grace Ke, 33, who plays futsal regularly about two to three times a week, said that street football courts are hard to find and difficult to secure. She stopped playing at such hard courts since secondary school and has since played the sport on paid artificial pitches. “As adults, time is precious and we don’t really have hours to spend waiting around for a court to be empty,” Ms Ke added. For student Dhia Sufi Suhaimi, 19, who has also stopped playing at these hard courts since secondary school, he prefers to play football at artificial pitches to prevent blisters and injuries. “I think the courts are not in good condition and players can potentially injure themselves, especially for younger kids playing.” Another student Daiyan Rizqi, 15, who plays futsal about twice a week, has shifted from playing at hard courts to artificial pitches. \"Playing on an artificial turf allows me to put on my football boots and there is a better feeling due to the softer surface.\" However, he lamented about the high prices of renting such facilities. \"As a teenager, I think the prices of artificial turf are not really affordable, even after splitting it among the players.\" Mr Huang Jiaming, 34, director of Kick Off!, told TODAY that the growth of venues providing artificial turfs can be attributed to the advancement in technology. “Although the set-up cost might be higher, but in the long term, it is cheaper as it requires a lot less maintenance. This is why more companies are coming into this business to invest in artificial turf.” Being a fully sheltered facility, Mr Huang said that people would also rather pay money to reduce the risk of calling off a game due to the bad weather, such as when they have to play outdoors at the hard courts. “In terms of safety, as parents, I would definitely want my kid to be playing on the (padded) astro turf as compared to a hard soccer court.” When it comes to safety, investing in the right footwear for football games is important, but that can also mean that parents have to spend more to satiate their children's roving eyes. The range can be mind-boggling with new boots being launched frequently. They run the gamut from those made for soft ground, hard ground and “multi-ground” to those for astro turfs or natural grass pitches. The fit also depends on the role of the player on the pitch, not to mention that the studs and cleats on the soles of boots matter for performance. Mr Huang attributed the power of marketing from big sporting brands such as Nike and Adidas as the main contributing factor causing a shift where younger people prefer paying to play on artificial pitches rather than the open-for-all street football courts. “With children now being exposed more to social media, they see their idols wearing new boot designs and want to emulate them,” Mr Huang said. Mr Rajesh Mulani, 54, director of The Cage, told TODAY that about a quarter of its customers are youth aged 18 or below. The company was set up 19 years ago and now operates 12 pitches in total for 5-a-side games at its Kallang and Dempsey locations. Like Kick Off!, The Cage also offers student-discounted rates, which are around S$69 for a two-hour session during off-peak hours at its Kallang venue, for instance. Mr Mulani said that playing on a good-quality turf offers shock absorption to the joints, helping to reduce injuries for players. He also said that Singapore's heat is \"uncompromising\", so that led him and co-founder Sanjay Danani to design a weather-independent venue to host small-sided games for players. \"We must recognise the impact of our weather on outdoor sports. Heat, rain, lighting — these are real. And it is high time that we, in Singapore, develop our own intelligence in how we design our public spaces to offer sensible shelter systems, which seems to be ignored right now.” Of the 12 residents who spoke to TODAY, 11 said that the street football courts should still be made available to the young. As it is, the likelihood remains that children tend to choose to play ball games close to home at the void decks below housing blocks , even though that is not allowed. Mr Lee the Clementi resident said: “It is good to preserve these hard courts. Not everyone has the privilege to rent astro-turf futsal courts to play. \"Since it is not allowed to play at void decks, street soccer courts give a place for children who likes football to play the sport near their homes.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

Mr Peter Zhuo, 39, creator of digital characters Ai and Aiko, posing with his son Oliver at their home on June 11, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. This Father's Day, TODAY speaks to two fathers on how parenthood has changed their outlook on life. One father with cerebral palsy raises two daughters — one with special needs — and another has a toddler who changed how he runs his business to put his child and his employees' families first. We find out what motivates them to be better dads every day. SINGAPORE — For artist Peter Zhuo, pursuing his artistic dreams and clinching four Guinness World Records has long been about fulfilling a promise to his late grandfather. That promise was to be a great artist one day, to make others smile with his drawings. Now, as a relative latecomer to fatherhood, he is also inspired by his seven-month-old son Oliver — and has even decided to work from home full-time to get maximum time with his boy. He has also offered his six full time employees in the animation studio that produced characters Ai and Aiko the option of working from home. \"I encourage my team to spend their time however they want, on the condition that they continue to meet the key results we all agreed on,\" he said. Mr Zhuo, 39, who also goes by the name Peter Draw, is the creator of digital characters Ai and Aiko, a red-shirt clad boy and his friend, a brown dog. The characters can be seen via various media such as 3D animation, digital comics, Japanese-style stop motion, exhibitions and toys. They have generated more than 64 billion views on Giphy, a platform that allows users to search and share animated Gif files. Becoming a first-time father has put a new perspective on his work, which he was first encouraged to pursue by his grandfather, who died when Mr Zhuo was 16. “After my grandfather passed away, I always somehow felt he was somewhere where he could see I was still trying to keep my promise,\" he told TODAY. \"I had a crazy urgency to draw as big and as much as I can, so hopefully somewhere, he could see.” Working with and for children has also been a constant in Mr Zhuo’s work. He noted that his four Guinness records incidentally were all achieved in the month of October and have coincided with Children’s Day. The records were for: Towards the third trimester of his wife’s pregnancy with Oliver, Mr Zhuo made the “difficult decision” to switch to fully working from home in preparation for his son’s arrival. This may have changed work dynamics with his colleagues, but fatherhood has brought a greater attention to detail, and given him a fresh artistic perspective, too. Mr Zhuo said that it was almost akin to “reliving (his) life as a child” and adopting the wonder and curiosity of a baby’s “beginner’s spirit”. “It’s re-living, an opportunity for me to go to the library again, hopefully go to the zoo, animal parks, go to places that we haven’t experienced for 20 years.” Working at home has also meant that he has been on hand to celebrate his toddler’s small achievements such as balancing and rolling. He tracks Oliver’s milestones in a WhatsApp chat he “insisted” on starting with his wife and Oliver’s grandmothers, where the couple sends daily updates of their toddler. The young family’s living room has been converted into a padded gated playpen for Oliver to roll around and explore, with photos of his life so far lining a kitchen shelf. “You realise for babies, their world is very limited to the environment they are in, so it makes me realise the meaning and purpose behind Ai and Aiko, and how we can expand their world and imagination a little more with our storytelling.” Beyond thinking of the world from Oliver’s point of view and being motivated to inspire more \"wow\" moments for young audiences, working from home has shaped his mindset as well. “Now I have this image of Oliver looking at me everywhere I go in the house, (so I think), is this the right decision you’re making? Is this a good decision that I will be proud of?” For Mr Zhuo, being a father is a dream he once doubted that he would ever realise, despite growing up saying he wanted to be the first among his friends to be a father. He had imagined that he would be “single forever” before marrying in November 2022 at the age of 38. “Some of (my peers), their kids are already in secondary school, and here is Oliver, seven months.” Mr Zhuo's strong relationship with his father and grandfather, one that he wants to replicate, has helped him navigate his creative career and this new journey of fatherhood. Looking back to his own childhood, one early turning point was when he got kicked out of a free trial art lesson at six years old, being told that he could not draw or hold a pencil properly. His family was too poor to afford future lessons. To comfort him, his grandfather told him a story of a boy “just like (him)”, who had thick eyebrows, loved to wear red T-shirts and held pencils with four fingers around the pencils, and who also got rejected. “I said, 'Ah gong (grandfather), you’re just repeating what I told you'. But he said, ‘No, but that boy never gave up and eventually created Disneyland and became very successful’.” His grandfather hesitated on the name of this boy, who would become an aspirational figure for Mr Zhuo for many years, before confidently mistaking Disneyland's creator Walt Disney for the famous Spanish artist Picasso. Driven by a desire to become this “Picasso”, the design of Mr Zhuo's characters Ai and Aiko are a nod to his grandfather’s mash of Picasso and Walt Disney. Ai's hair is shaped after Picasso's illustration of a dove and the character's round face was inspired by Disney character Mickey Mouse. While his grandfather was not an artist, Mr Zhuo recalled the pencil sketches of sparrows that the old man would give him, which he thought were very life-like at the time and “the best drawings in the world”. Another “happiest moment” from his childhood was hearing the jangle of keys at the gate of his father, who was a taxi driver on the night shift, returning with supper or an early breakfast from a coffee shop. Cherishing these memories of the two generations of fathers before him, who have inspired his creative work, it has left him excited to make new ones with Oliver as a first-time father. These could be simply eating together as a family or collecting all the toddler's first drawings. “And if one day he becomes an artist, and (will) do even better than me, then I’ll be his biggest fan, again shouting and cheering,” Mr Zhuo said.

She aspired to creating her own game one day so that she could bring the joy she got from games to others. Miss Jiang Tongyu having her picture taken at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California on June 10, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE/CALIFORNIA (United States) — When she was aged eight or nine, Miss Jiang Tongyu loved playing video games with her brother. She aspired to creating her own game one day so that she could bring the joy she got from games to others. Her passion for technology led her to learn about coding, and this year Miss Jiang, now 18, created a music game called Tambourine Story. That game has propelled the Raffles Institution student to be one of 50 \"distinguished winners\" of Apple's Swift Student Challenge from around the world. It earned her a fully paid trip to Apple Park in California in the United States, hosted by the technology giant's chief executive officer Tim Cook, whom she had met in April when he visited Singapore. Back then, she showed Mr Cook her Tambourine Story game. She also got to rub shoulders with other developers at the California event. The international competition, launched in 2020 by Apple, is designed for students to showcase their coding skills and creativity by developing app playgrounds and earn real-world experience that they can take into their careers. It is named after Apple's programming language Swift. The event Miss Jiang attended on Monday (June 10) was Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California, an annual gathering where the company announces new software capabilities for its devices. A total of 300 developers were \"regular\" winners at this year's event, along with the 50 \"distinguished winners\", an innovation this year. Miss Jiang is one of five Singaporeans to receive an award for the Swift Student Challenge for this year, but the only one to clinch one in the distinguished winner category. She was also one of the regular winners of the competition last year with a game dealing with mental health. She said that her latest game, Tambourine Story, which took one of the \"distinguished\" awards this year, was inspired by her love for music, having played the piano and guitar. Two years ago, she formed a band with her schoolmates and started to rehearse and play music together. “There was something different about playing music together and everything coming together and sounding really good,\" she said. \"It feels like you're part of something special. So I wanted to create something to capture that feeling and called my game Tambourine Story.” The story-based game follows a little girl’s journey of trying to join a band. Unlike other rhythm games that makes the player tap on the screen to play it, Tambourine Story requires the user to shake the iPad like a tambourine in order to play. Miss Jiang thought of the idea late last year and worked on it for two months, she said. “I just really love expressing emotions through games. I think it’s a really powerful medium.” As a child, Miss Jiang spent a lot of time playing Minecraft and rhythm games, which also inspired Tambourine Story. Since joining the infocomm club in secondary school in 2019, she had taken part in hackathons and coding competitions. A year later, she entered Apple’s Swift Accelerator Programme, where secondary school students learn to develop a “Swift” application over the course of a year, and then publish it on the App Store. After her group’s to-do list app was published, she felt that she “could do anything with technology” and wanted to do more projects using the Swift coding language. This was when she decided to sign up for the Swift Student Challenge last year, where she created a game called City Night, focused on mental health. It clinched an award. Miss Jiang, who is now taking Higher 2 computing classes at school, said that one-third of her class are girls and that “most of them are better than the boys in coding on average”. Does the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) sector lack women? Miss Jiang responded: “I feel like most people wouldn't outright say it. But sometimes you can feel it’s a little different. “For example, when you go to a tech conference, the guys are talking. But I feel like there's definitely been a lot more recognition over the past few years. “I've been to a few events such as Girls in Tech, specially organised for students. And I think it's really good that there are all these opportunities for girls to try out different tech without being judged.” She added that society should not generalise that all girls and women do not like working in the Stem field. While she acknowledged that pursuing a tech career can lead to a good living, she felt that it makes more sense to pursue a career that one finds meaningful. Apart from considering a tech career, she is also looking at fields such as the arts. “Most people would think that tech and arts are on the opposite side of the field. But... the intersection is really interesting to me. So I would love to explore more on new media, games and animation.” Following her A-Level examination at the end of this year, Miss Jiang hopes to pursue tech or the arts at a university here or in the US. She also hopes to keep developing Tambourine Story into a longer game that would one day be on the main Apple App Store.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — I'd thought about committing to a digital detox for some time, especially given the rigours of my work, which requires me to be connected to my phone all day. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — I'd thought about committing to a digital detox for some time, especially given the rigours of my work, which requires me to be connected to my phone all day. The concept of going cold turkey, at least during non-working hours, was appealing to me, especially after I read what my colleague Renald wrote last week. He experienced some measure of success in his week-long cold turkey experiment . I was also confident that I was disciplined enough to stick to my detox routine. I was piqued by his conclusion that he was able to reclaim his time and mental space even with the constant notifications and demands for instant responses that have become routine. However, when I gave it a go, things turned out differently and my digital detox quickly turned out to be a resounding failure. For starters, technology seemed unavoidable even as I tried to cut it out from my life. Like what Renald experienced, navigating unfamiliar places required me to use my phone as a digital guide. Even at restaurants, QR codes often replaced physical menus. Then there was also work-related communication, which I could not simply ignore. Knowing that I would never be able to function normally with zero use of my phone, I sought the advice of experts on how to instead cultivate a healthier relationship with the device while still staying connected and productive. It was through their help that I found a better solution — one that involves setting boundaries that are customised to my needs and lifestyle. The old adage “If you can’t beat them, join them” rings true when it comes to managing phone dependency, and using technology to help us disconnect may work more effectively. Ms Chern Hui Ying, a counsellor at Huggs the Heart Therapy, recommended wellness applications like Forest, which claims on its website to help users stay focused \"on the important things in life\". In this app, users set a time limit to how long they wish to stay off their phone and a virtual tree will grow as long as they stay off their phone. If they exit the app to use their phone, the tree withers and dies. I was immediately taken by the concept. For starters, it's a cute play on the carrot-and-stick approach, though I had some reservations about whether using the app meant that I'd still be tempted to use the phone for other purposes — like doom-scrolling on social media. So, over several days, I tried out the app. I found it incredibly useful in managing my phone usage, although I admit that I gave up more than once, which caused my virtual forest to be decimated. Whenever I reached over to check my phone, the app displayed messages including \"Stop phubbing!\" and \"Get back to work\", which effectively reminded me to stay off my phone. The calming and soothing forest sounds it played in the background also created a serene environment that made concentrating easier. Perhaps it was also the discomfort of seeing my hard-earned forest wither away due to a lack of discipline that kept me motivated. Overall, Forest transformed the challenge of reducing screen time into an engaging, pleasant experience. Besides Forest, there are also other apps such as Flipd or Offtime that can also enforce breaks and provide insights into phone usage patterns, promoting a more mindful and balanced approach to phone use. Ultimately, these apps seek to reward healthy behaviour and punish unhealthy ones, but not in a manner that could cripple your daily life, vis a vis not being able to use the phone. It boils down to setting clear goals and allocating set periods for screen-free activities, and in reality, you don't really need an app to do that. Ms Chern said that to strike a balance between necessary phone use and reducing screen time, one way to do so is to set \"smart goals\", which refers to specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely goals. “A goal such as ‘to not use my phone’ may not be as effective as ‘to reduce time spent on my phone by 50 per cent a week’. This is due to the latter being measurable and achievable,” she added. Another expert said that setting physical and virtual boundaries for phone usage can help reduce the urge to scroll impulsively. Ms Priscilla Shin, principal psychotherapist of Range Counselling Services, said that utilising focus modes or \"do not disturb\" settings during work or relaxation times can significantly reduce interruptions. This could involve designating phone-free zones such as the dining area or bedroom and setting specific times for phone use, such as limiting social media to certain hours. In terms of virtual boundaries, turning off non-essential notifications also reduces interruptions in the hours you have set for yourself to use the phone, Ms Shin recommended. Using screen-time trackers and app blockers can also help us to monitor and limit screen time, she added. That said, how do we determine what goals and boundaries to set in the first place? Mr Chirag Agarwal, co-founder and chief growth officer of online counselling and coaching platform Talk Your Heart Out, said that we should first be honest with ourselves about how much we depend on our phones for various uses like work, administrative tasks or even entertainment. “This way, when you draw up plans to limit your usage, you do so in a way that does not disrupt your life and so you are less likely to give up altogether,” he advised. This approach can help us to work out how much is a reasonable amount when it comes to duration of phone use, he added. Acting on their advice, I set a goal to reduce my screen time on Instagram, the app I use the most, by 25 per cent. I also designated my bedroom as a phone-free zone. I admit, it was tough trying to stick to the rules I had set for myself, and the lure of instant gratification tempted me more times than I could count in the week when I tried this new approach. However, I stuck to my resolve through sheer willpower, using strategies such as disabling Instagram after 9pm and placing my phone somewhere else during my dinner time, which is a screen-free period. Gradually, I found that my urge to check my phone diminished, and I enjoyed more restful evenings without the distraction of social media. Compared with going cold turkey, Ms Shin from Range Counselling Service said that setting boundaries and being intentional with phone use is a more sustainable approach because it gradually reduces phone use and eases the transition. This allows people to develop healthier habits over time without the shock of an abrupt cessation. “This gradual approach also reduces stress and anxiety associated with sudden withdrawal, while positive reinforcement from incremental improvements boosts motivation,” she added. Some of Ms Shin’s clients who have adopted these methods reduced their screen time by 30 to 50 per cent, and reported that their productivity and focus levels also got a boost. Mr Agarwal from Talk Your Heart Out said that because mobile phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, it is difficult to unilaterally decide to stop using them and any attempt to go cold turkey is more likely to fail. “The idea here is to find a new healthy balance in terms of phone usage that you can sustain for the long run and not ‘kick the habit’ like you would with smoking, for instance, where the cold turkey approach may work.” For people (like me), who lack discipline in setting boundaries and following rules, Mr Agarwal recommended starting with small changes such as leaving the mobile phone outside the bedroom and building your way up to more challenging changes such as uninstalling a social media app. Ms Shin said that using positive reinforcement such as rewarding yourself when meeting your goals is another way to help you stay on track. “For example, giving yourself a full 30 minutes of your favourite Netflix show is one way you can celebrate a milestone,” she said of the entertainment streaming provider. Infusing fun and engagement into daily activities instead of merely trying to avoid phone usage is another approach that Ms Chern suggested, recommending that people seek out offline activities such as playing board games or spending time outdoors in the park to enjoy more fulfilling experiences. “When you are living life more fully and in the moment, there would be a reduced likelihood of being tempted to rely on your devices for entertainment,” she added. Since adopting these strategies, I felt like I had gotten more restful nights of sleep thanks to a phone-free bedroom and I also noticed fewer problems such as eye strain from excessive screen time. Socially, my interactions with my family have been more meaningful and present, where we talk about how our day went over dinner instead of being distracted by digital notifications. While these changes indeed took time and discipline, such an approach helped me to foster a more balanced relationship with my phone. For now, I will try the next step that will require even more discipline on my end: Whenever I'm left to my own devices every Saturday, I want to reduce my mindless scrolling of TikTok. And I think I can achieve this with the help of the Forest app, because it's either I cut my TikTok usage, or the app cuts down my field of carefully grown trees.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Twenty-two year old Nicolette Koh does not have fond memories of primary school and remembers feeling lonely and left out. Miss Nicolette Koh (pictured) was awarded the 2023 Goh Chok Tong Enable Award (Promise), which is given out by the Goh Chok Tong Enable Fund. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Twenty-three year old Nicolette Koh does not have fond memories of primary school and remembers feeling lonely and left out. When other children were talking and playing, Miss Koh would try to join them but gave up eventually because she could not understand what was going on. Miss Koh, who was diagnosed with hearing loss at the age of two , remembers spending most of her time wandering around school alone. \" It is hard to listen to the person speaking to you when their voice blends with the background noise, producing a flurry of noises that is beyond comprehension ,\" she said. Miss Koh was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss in her right ear and profound hearing loss in her left ear at two, but today she has profound hearing loss in both ears. \"It was hard adjusting to a society that was not meant for me.\" The World Health Organization states that profound hearing loss is categorised by very little or no hearing. After hearing aids failed to improve her hearing, Miss Koh went for her first cochlear surgery at five years old. She had a second surgery at the age of 12 and a final surgery a year later. Even after the surgeries, she has trouble hearing others in noisy places though overall, her hearing has improved. Her experience as a child continued somewhat into her secondary school years but as she got older, she had a more supportive environment. She was surrounded by people who were open-minded, willing to talk with and learn from her, and be receptive of her without forming any pre-judgements. Miss Koh added that she had teachers who were better equipped to look after students with accessibility needs. During her polytechnic years, however, she decided she wanted to do something about the way society viewed and treated people with disabilities. As a third-year pharmeceutical science student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, she co-founded NP Supportify. It is a club dedicated to raising awareness about people with disabilities and providing social-emotional support to students with disabilities. The club, which had 50 members, organised bi-weekly support group sessions called \"Playlist\". It created a safe space for disabled students to interact with others and talk about the difficulties that they may have encountered. Its goal was to provide socio-emotional support and allow students to make friends without judgement. With a grade point average of 3.97, Miss Koh graduated as valedictorian from the polytechnic with a diploma in pharmaceutical sciences. For her efforts in raising awareness about persons with disabilities, she was awarded the 2023 Goh Chok Tong Enable Award (Promise), which is given out by the Goh Chok Tong Enable Fund. The fund, which has been giving out the award since 2019, aims to provide persons with disabilities the opportunities to actively contribute to society and lead socially integrated lives. It is a dministered by SG Enable, a government-linked agency supporting persons with disabilities, and supported by news organisation Mediacorp, with Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong as the patron . Miss Koh has continued her efforts in raising awareness for people with disabilities at the National University of Singapore (NUS) where she is now pursuing a degree in pharmacy. She is the president of the NUS Enablers club, which is an advocacy group that aims to create an inclusive campus by promoting accessibility and empowerment. One activity organised by the group is called the Human Library, wher e NUS students with different accessibility needs are the \"books\" and other students converse with these participants to learn more about what life is like for a student with disabilities on campus. Other activities include sign language lessons organised in collaboration with Equal Dreams and NUS SIGNapse, a sign language club. Equal Dreams is an organisation that provides disability, accessibility and consultancy services and creates platforms for disabled people to pursue passion projects. Some of their services include sign language interpretation and sign language workshops. Of her dream that everyone learns the language, Miss Koh said: \"If everyone in Singapore knows sign language, then there would be fewer communication barriers.\" Although she has had extensive speech therapy and three surgeries and is able to understand and enunciate most words, strangers still notice a slight difference in Miss Koh's speech. Often, she is asked why she has an accent. \"A common question I receive is: Are you Singaporean?\" She added that she rarely tells people whom she has just met about her hearing issues because she does not want to be labelled as \"disabled\". This is because it leads to people having pre-conceived notions about what she is able or unable to do. It also sometimes leads to people being overly nice , or what she describes as \"infantilising\". \"People should try being empathetic to everyone in general,\" Miss Koh said on the balance between being empathetic and infantilising. Reflecting on her Goh Chok Tong Enable award last year, the young woman who lives with her parents and two older siblings said that it made her more \"attuned to her identity as a disabled person\". \"Having a better understanding of my identity gave me more self-confidence to encourage others.\" It is her hope that other people with disabilities will speak out and take care of their futures. \"I want to encourage my peers with disabilities to advocate for themselves and reduce the barriers so that they are able to achieve their dreams.\" As for society in general, she hopes that people will just be more sensitive to the needs of those with disabilities. \"A small step goes really a long way.\" To support persons with disabilities through the Goh Chok Tong Enable Fund, visit GCTEnableFund.sg . Nominations for the annual Goh Chok Tong Enable Award are now open until July 17, 2024. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated Miss Koh's age as 22. She is 23.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — After seeing posters at the lift lobby of her Tampines public housing block publicising a constituency trip to Batam, Indonesia, resident Eileen Kim thought that it would be interesting to travel with her Member of Parliament (MP) Baey Yam Keng. Member of Parliament Baey Yam Keng (front) travelling to Ayer Hitam, Malaysia with residents in December 2023. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — After seeing posters at the lift lobby of her Tampines public housing block publicising a constituency trip to Batam, Indonesia, resident Eileen Kim thought that it would be interesting to travel with her Member of Parliament (MP) Baey Yam Keng. Another plus was that, as a participant, she did not need to organise the two-day trip in July last year. Everything was pre-arranged, including transport to the ferry terminal. The pick-up and drop-off location was her nearest Residents’ Network. Constituency trips have become increasingly popular, so much so that Mr Baey said in a Facebook post last month that a couple of residents who missed out on places in one recent trip \"kicked up a big fuss\" and scolded some of his volunteers. He is the MP for Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC). Ms Kim, 42, a regional business development manager, told TODAY that she was aware of the high demand for such trips, so her family acted quickly. “My parents were the ones who suggested the idea because they’ve always thought fondly of Mr Baey, so we immediately registered our interest,\" she said. “They previously tried to get tickets for another trip but couldn't because there were too many people.” Sure enough, demand for the Batam trip was hot. Ms Kim and her family were joined by some 200 other residents for the weekend getaway. Registration was open on a Sunday from 10am to 12pm, and many residents rushed to secure their spots. The first person reportedly arrived at 5am, five hours early. Ms Kim and her parents arrived at 8am to find a small queue had already formed. A month earlier, Ms Kim's father, Mr Kim Joo Hwee, 69, had missed out on tickets for another trip because he arrived late. “After (ticket sales) started at 9am, we arrived at 9.30am. My wife and I were surprised. We didn’t think it would be so popular,” he said. He recalled that his first trip with an MP was with Aljunied GRC MP Gerald Giam to Lake Toba, Indonesia. His friend in his 60s had asked if Mr Kim and his wife would like to join, having spontaneously bought tickets for them, and the couple agreed even though their residence was under Tampines GRC. “I remember that my friend got the tickets within the day. She didn’t tell me she had to queue or say it was difficult to get. That’s why we didn’t know (these trips were so popular),” Mr Kim added. “Before this, we didn’t even know such constituency trips existed.” Fellow Tampines resident Vincent Cao, 36, said that when he and his wife joined the queue (the same one as Ms Kim’s) at 9.45am — 15 minutes before opening time — the number of people already in line caught them by surprise as well. They managed to snag their tickets at around 11am. “Our main objective was to travel, so the queueing wasn’t a big deal. We enjoyed the experience, and after paying, we just needed to gather at the nearest Residents’ Network, and we’re off.” The frequency of these constituency trips depends on the organisers. Some might hold them only once or twice yearly, while others are able to organise them several times a year. In a Facebook post on May 31, Mr Baey described the behaviour of some residents who missed out on places in a recent trip. A total of 228 tickets were sold for a trip to Malacca and Muar in Malaysia from July 13 to 14 organised by the Tampines North branch of the People's Action Party. “For our past registrations, those who couldn’t get tickets were naturally disappointed, but they accepted that others had queued up earlier and waited longer,\" he wrote. “However, this time, it was unusual that a couple of people kicked up a big fuss, rallied others to find fault and even scolded my volunteers.” In his Facebook post, Mr Baey said that even though residents were told registration for the tour would start at 7pm on Monday, May 27, they started to form a queue around 3pm. When the grassroots volunteers arrived around 6.30pm, they started doing a count before informing about 100 people who were further back in the queue that they were unlikely to get tickets. Mr Baey said that some of the feedback his team had received included: In response to TODAY’s queries, Mr Baey said that organisers could explore adding other registration options to cater to those who are unable to register at the designated time. “We will still maintain the first-come-first-serve principle and not do a ballot as the tickets, while popular, are not subsidised… Participants pay what the travel agency charges,” he added. “We are also unlikely to require all participants to be residents as they are mostly family and friends of residents, and we want to be more inclusive.” MPs who join their residents on such trips told TODAY that participants generally enjoy the convenience of having the pick-up and drop-off locations in their neighbourhood, saving them the hassle of making their own way to ferry terminals or land checkpoints. Mr Liang Eng Hwa, MP for Bukit Panjang, said: “If you live near a CC (Community Club) or RC (Residents’ Committee), you can meet there, and the bus will take you to your destination. The logistics are taken care of for you.” Asked if the price point is also a factor, MPs and trip organisers said that the tour packages are charged according to the market rate in collaboration with travel agencies. Ang Mo Kio GRC MP Gan Thiam Poh said that compared with travelling with strangers on a tour, residents prefer these trips because they can bond with their neighbours, fostering a strong sense of community. “And it’s not just the same people who always go on these trips. I see different faces each time, and it’s a good mix of young and older families.” The length of these trips also plays a part in demand. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, MP for Mountbatten, said that in his constituency, he sees higher demand for two-day trips to Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia compared with three-day ones to places further afield such as Bangkok in Thailand or Hong Kong. “There will still be interest, but only among a smaller pool of people because I think few would want to take time off to do it.” Mr Lim added that they also have to take extra care in looking after the seniors on the trips. Grassroots leaders and volunteers usually care for them, because they typically need help with mobility, such as getting on and off the bus. Mr Jackson Au, a Workers’ Party (WP) coordinator for the Serangoon ward of Aljunied GRC, said that the trips are organised at the division level by volunteers, with the WP MPs joining their residents to destinations as nearby as Johor Bahru, and as far away as Jeju Island in South Korea. Tickets for some trips can be very popular, Mr Au added. “For recent trips organised by Serangoon and Paya Lebar (wards), the posters in the lift lobbies had to be taken down after just a few days after tickets had sold out.” An upcoming trip to southern Thailand and various spots in Malaysia on July 12 saw volunteers having to open more departure dates to accommodate the demand. Mr Au said that with meals and accommodation covered, the trips have high value, and it is part of the service to constituents. Since the trips are not sponsored or subsidised, volunteers who join these trips to ensure everything goes smoothly have to pay for the trip themselves, as it is with any resident who joins the tour. Mr Justin Fong, 54, a grassroots volunteer and chairman of Jalan Batu Residents’ Network, said that volunteers such as himself are in charge of ensuring everything proceeds as planned. They also serve as the “extra hands, legs, and eyes” for residents, especially older ones, by helping them with their luggage and guiding them to where they want to go. As for managing ticketing sales, Mr Fong said that it was important to be “as fair as possible” to everyone and manage their expectations. “When people are disappointed, we explain that it’s on a first-come-first-served basis. We also tell them where we usually publicise these trips and when to look out for them. “These trips have been popular all along, even before Covid. But based on my observation, it does feel like the trips have been getting more popular recently. Perhaps participation is better due to better ways of promotion such as through social media.” Mr Au, who attends some trips as a volunteer with the Aljunied Constituency Committee, a grassroots committee under WP, said that the heightened moments for him are the early start to these trips. This is because of the experience with latecomers or forgetful residents who did not take along their passports, so he made it a point to brief the volunteer team on what to do during such situations. Thankfully, during the two trips he has gone on so far, there were no such problems. “It’s nice to see the happy looks on everyone’s faces during the trips, especially when they come together for a group photo. It makes all the preparation work feel worth it.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For 34-year-old homemaker Logeswari, who lives with five children in a two-room public rental flat in Bedok, the recent spate of very hot weather has made life harder in several ways: The nausea from her pregnancy feels more unbearable, her utility bills have doubled and her five-year-old son scratches himself throughout the night because of the heat. She and her children have eczema, which has been exacerbated by the hot and humid conditions and increased sweating. As the mercury climbed in the past three months, she bought a portable air conditioner secondhand for around S$200, though running it through the day has raised her electricity bills from S$90 a month to around S$200 now. \"For this kind of unit, this is considered quite high. I'm quite worried if prices keep increasing,\" said Ms Logeswari, who goes by only one name. As Singaporeans have had to deal with increasingly hot weather on a regular basis, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched Singapore’s first Heat Stress Advisory last July, to guide the population on how to minimise the risk of heat-related illness. In conversations with rental flat residents and low-income workers, TODAY found that low-income families such as Ms Logeswari's are finding it extra tough to do so. Their living conditions make the discomfort more palpable, while steps they take to combat the heat are leading to heavy utility bills they can hardly afford. Most of them do not have in-unit air conditioners as residents of Government-subsidised rental flats have to seek permission from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) before carrying out any renovation works, including the installation of air conditioners. The Ministry of National Development (MND) has said this in line with market practice, where tenants have to seek landlords’ permission before making changes to their units. In a written reply to parliamentary questions in July 2023 on whether air conditioners are allowed in HDB rental flats, the ministry said HDB considers such requests on a case-by-case basis. “While HDB does not track the number of requests to install air conditioners in public rental flats, only a small proportion of tenants have made such requests. HDB has generally approved such requests, taking into consideration tenants’ circumstances, such as medical grounds,\" MND said. More broadly, climate experts and activists around the world have noted that while vulnerable and low-income communities are often the least responsible for contributing to climate change, they disproportionately bear the negative effects . As extreme weather persists and heat stress emerges as a critical concern, they say it is important to see how low-income families here are coping with rising temperatures, and what can be done to build heat resilience among vulnerable communities. Because she and her kids suffer from eczema, Ms Logeswari received approval from HDB to install an air-conditioning unit. But she ultimately decided against it, as the combined cost of an air-conditioning unit, installation and monthly electricity bills were prohibitive. So she bought a portable air conditioner, but that has led to some angst too. \"The girls sleep in the room and the boys sleep outside. If I put (the portable air-conditioner) one way, it will trigger (fights), because they will say, 'How come they sleep in aircon and we cannot?'\" Ms Nor Aisyah, a 33-year-old homemaker with five children who lives in a two-room rental flat in Bedok, recently bought a portable air conditioner, too, for around S$500. This was very expensive for her, but she feels her children, aged six to 15, need it. The younger ones have become more susceptible to the common cold and fevers since the weather got hotter, she said, falling sick twice a month lately as infections easily spread in their close quarters. Since the purchase, her electricity bills have doubled to around S$50 a week because she runs the portable air conditioner for around three hours every night, she said, which eats into her budget for groceries and medical expenses. Staying cool is also a medical necessity for Ms Rosnah Md Tahir, 51, a retiree who lives in a two-room rental flat in Upper Boon Keng, as her diabetes makes her perspire easily, which then causes her to get heat rashes. She has started to bathe three to four times a day to keep cool, and runs two fans all day, causing her water and electricity bills to rise by S$50 a month. “It’s very hot and everything is expensive, so for people with low incomes, it does strain them. Even as we have received more rebates (from the Government) and we try to save, (prices) continue to go up,” said Ms Rosnah. For Ms Marlina Yased, a 45-year-old community worker who lives in a two-room rental flat with a family of six, creative solutions are the only means of staying cool. She puts ice cubes in spray bottles to cast water on the walls on hot days, which goes some way towards cooling the flat, although on some days the heat makes the water evaporate instantaneously, she said. “Outside it can be 38 degrees, but inside it is 42 degrees, because we’re covered by solar panels and the water tank is right above (our unit). The tap water (feels) like boiling water after 10am,” said Ms Marlina. In her family's small space, Ms Marlina said tensions inevitably rise on hotter days, as the “heat is doubled” when she cooks, and she has noticed her daughters also feeling more frustrated as there are more limits to how girls and women can adapt their dressing to the weather. “Men can wear boxers (when it’s hot), but if we women want to do the same and go outside, people will complain.” Meanwhile, those who work outdoors say the heat has affected their earnings. Food delivery rider Peter Yeo, 52, is not a rental flat tenant but his work requires him to be exposed to the weather most of the time. When the NEA ultraviolet index hit extreme levels in March, he decided to work at night, as the sun made his skin feel “very painful”. But this caused his earnings to dip. “My earnings were affected tremendously as the midnight orders may (involve) very far pickups, and I have to reject the orders,” said Mr Yeo, who carries out deliveries on a power-assisted bike. Ms Siti Nurani Salim, founder of Project Goodwill Aid, a volunteer group that conducts food distribution exercises in rental estates, has received more complaints from residents about the weather since February. The organisation has been assisting households to get fans and provides financial aid by topping up beneficiaries’ Pay-As-You-Use (PayU) accounts for their electricity bills. “It’s too hot, there are not enough fans for their homes. Some actually ask for portable coolers but we advise them that it will (lead to much higher) electricity bills,” said Ms Nurani. Being restricted to low-cost cooling solutions that are less effective, such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected during periods of extreme heat, said Associate Professor Jason Lee, who is director of the Heat Resilience and Performance Centre at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in the National University of Singapore (NUS). Additionally, many low-income individuals usually take on menial jobs which require “long-term exposure to extreme weather conditions”, he noted. They also have a higher tendency to work extremely hard to meet job-related quotas, even at the risk of their health, said Assoc Prof Lee. Agreeing, a spokesperson from SG Climate Rally, which organised a rally that saw over 1,400 attendees last September , said that climate change exposes low-income groups to “additional vulnerabilities” as many do not have the protection of working in an air-conditioned environment. “Their low income reduces the extent to which these communities can deal with the challenges posed by climate change. Rising food prices due to climate change-induced crop failures hurt lower-income families the most, because spending on necessities like food takes up a larger share of their budget,” said the spokesperson. Lower-income families are also more sensitive to the costs associated with mitigating the heat, as utility bills tend to take up a larger percentage of their household expenses, said Associate Professor Alberto Salvo, deputy head of research at the department of Economics at NUS. A 2018 study by Assoc Prof Salvo , which analysed the utility bills of over 100,000 households here, found that low-income households consumed much more water as temperatures rise. This is likely because lower-income families tend to rely on water, through taking more frequent, longer showers, to beat the heat, as they may not have air conditioning units or find them costly to operate. More affluent households, by contrast, reflected a marked increase in electricity demand and no significant change in water consumption when temperatures rise. A forthcoming study looking at how heat fluctuations affect economic activity in Singapore has found increased attendance and commuting to workplaces, malls and more air-conditioned schools on hotter days, particularly by low-income residents with limited access to cooling measures at home, said Assoc Prof Salvo. This shows that public infrastructure should be designed to help more vulnerable communities beat the heat in the long run, and more resources could be allocated to providing cooling facilities in common spaces that are accessible to all, experts said. For example, free-to-use air-conditioned community spaces like public libraries and community centres near rental estates, similar to the “haze sanctuaries” proposed in the event of extreme haze , could provide students and outdoor workers some relief in critically hot moments, such as the afternoon. In response to TODAY's queries to MSE and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), a Government spokesperson said that the authorities adopt a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy by: The spokesperson pointed to the Heat Stress Advisory published in July 2023 as one way to strengthen the community’s resilience to heat. There is also the myENV app, which Singaporeans can use to monitor the prevailing heat stress levels before heading outdoors. To increase scientific understanding of changing weather, initiatives such as the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project are studying the impact of heat on different segments of the population, such as the elderly and children. It also assesses the effectiveness of various cooling strategies, such as the application of cool paints on the exterior of buildings. As for what is being done to help households defray utility bills, the Government spokesperson noted that eligible Singaporean households living in HDB flats can offset their utility expenses with the GST Voucher – U-Save and the Assurance Package (AP) U-Save. U-Save rebates for financial year 2024 are disbursed in the months of April, July, October this year and January next year. In total, as announced in Budget 2024 , eligible households will receive up to $950 in U-Save rebates this financial year. HDB households may also use climate vouchers provided under the Climate Friendly Households Programme , which offers HDB households S$300 worth of vouchers to offset the cost of buying climate-friendly appliances. Families in greater need who cannot meet their daily living expenses can receive additional assistance via ComCare, which provides clients with monthly cash assistance and help with their utility expenses, if needed, after accounting for U-Save rebates. \"The actual quantum of ComCare assistance is derived based on each family’s needs, so it will vary across families,\" the spokesperson said. \"ComCare clients who need more support can approach their nearest Social Service Office, where officers will look into how to assist the household holistically.\" MSF regularly reviews the ComCare assistance quanta to ensure that they remain relevant and adequate to meet the needs of lower-income families, the spokesperson added.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — As I prepared to meet 28-year-old Adeline Tay for an interview on her TikTok fame and her journey as an “alopecian”, I found myself mulling over how to be delicate when approaching the subject of her hair loss. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — As I prepared to meet 28-year-old Adeline Tay for an interview on her TikTok fame and her journey as an “alopecian”, I found myself mulling over how to be delicate when approaching the subject of her hair loss. Yet, from the moment I walked into the room, any fear of awkward tension — from either of us — quickly evaporated thanks to her warm and bubbly demeanour. In hindsight, I shouldn't have been too surprised by this. After all, Ms Tay is also no stranger to being in front of a camera, as a creative strategist and host at digital publisher Our Grandfather Story and content creator on social media platform TikTok. As one of her more than 40,000 followers on TikTok, where she goes by the username “adelimey” and describes herself as “a botak (Malay for bald) in her trial-and-error era”, I have learnt more about alopecia totalis, the auto-immune condition which causes unpredictable hair loss. A former officer cadet in the Singapore Armed Forces, Ms Tay was first diagnosed in 2016. Her first bald spot appeared to be the size of a 20-cent coin-like patch at the back of her head before becoming larger. At one point, she lost around 95 per cent of her hair, including her eyebrows and eyelashes. One of her most popular TikTok videos showed her colleagues joining her to wear bucket hats as a show of support during an alopecia relapse. Other popular posts include one that showcased the different haircuts proposed by her barber, as well as those that debunk misperceptions about the condition. When I met her earlier this month (May 3), she was in her sixth regrowth, referring to a period when some hair grows back. She was sporting what looks like a pixie cut from the front, though she turned to reveal some patches of hair loss spread across the back of her head. Despite describing herself as “pretty awkward” offline, as I sat across from Ms Tay for over an hour, my initial wariness of broaching supposedly sensitive subjects dissipated. What resonated with me, and undoubtedly does too with her online following, is the candour and cheerful courage she brings to navigating everyday life. Her platform started as a way to raise awareness on living with an auto-immune condition that lacks a permanent cure. It has now expanded to feature reflections on anything from mental health to documenting the simple joys of buying an inflatable frog keychain. Almost as if she was comforting me rather than being interviewed by me, much as she does online, she said: “I want to reach people who are trying their best everyday to figure out (how to live) life. \"I hope that if I promote it (alopecia) and normalise it, I get to reach out to people who are like me, and let them know it is fine. We all grow at our own pace.” The start of her TikTok stardom was a happy accident, as her first viral video in October 2021 was the incessant morning call of an Asian koel bird in her neighbourhood. “I have never imagined myself being a content creator. I do make funny videos, but that is just for my friends, and I posted that video not knowing it would appear on other people’s 'for you' pages as well,” said Ms Tay. In her second video of the noisy bird, she accidentally included herself in the video, which drew comments from viewers who asked about her then thinning and mostly white hair. True to her aims to keep things light, she initially joked in reply that her hair loss was because she ate too much instant noodles or because of academic stress. She then made a segue to spread awareness about her auto-immune condition. Ms Tay now has a series of over 30 videos called “All about Alopecia”, where she has shared on how she copes with hair loss and has fielded questions such as: Are you a boy or a girl? Becoming a content creator is another one of life’s twists and turns for Ms Tay, and cracking jokes about her condition is something she could not have imagined years ago. “When I was first diagnosed, I was really depressed and hid away for a good while. I didn't even look in the mirror back then,” she said. She added that during that initial period she and her family had become more dejected as they explored various treatments to no avail. “I didn’t have eyebrows then, but I had a white board marker at home, so I tried drawing my eyebrows with a whiteboard marker. I found it pretty funny, and saw my parents laughing, and I thought: 'Why not? Just learn to find joy in it'.” Yet even as Ms Tay’s humour shone through, it did not take long before our conversation treaded into personal matters closer to her heart. Though she set up her platform to spread awareness about alopecia, Ms Tay said it has become like a journal for her, as her physical and mental health journey has been anything but linear. When I asked how she feels about her current stage of hair regrowth, she admitted that she was initially hesitant to talk about it out of fear of the next relapse. “Even to this day, I’m pretty afraid. You get paranoid when you wake up and you see hairs on your pillow or when you shower, there’s more hair than usual,” said Ms Tay. “When I go through a relapse, it’s not just myself, it’s the people around me who go through it emotionally too. I’m afraid of getting people’s hopes up and disappointing them again.” More than a cosmetic problem, she added that the emotional experience of having alopecia should not be discounted as people with the condition can feel helpless as they do not have agency over an important, highly visible part of their appearance. On her TikTok platform, she often shares her emotions in documenting her “growing pains” in the areas of work, relationships and health. “Dealing with mental health and the relapses of alopecia, there are good and bad days. Some days you will be so happy and another I might be crying in another TikTok video.\" She added that there is no formulaic approach to what she does, just a wish to \"document life\" as an adult doing her best. Ms Tay tells me that she makes edits before posting — such as trimming a recent emotional two-minute video on friendship breakups down from 40 minutes. Still, she said that her platform is one where she is “unashamed” to share the downsides of life, as she hopes it helps others feel “less alone”. It is this vulnerability that has connected her with others with similar struggles, many of whom have thanked her over direct messages for sharing her mental health journey and made their own confessions such as having difficulty getting up in the morning. She recalled realising the “very real” impact her videos had when a cancer patient tagged her in a video, stating that she had been inspired to shave her hair off because she had seen Ms Tay openly discussing her hair loss. On another occasion, during a period when Ms Tay had patchy hair, she encountered a mean comment from a group of secondary school students. One of the boys in the group had blurted out while she was within earshot: “What’s up with her hair?” She was stunned, but was then encouraged by the reaction of another boy, who turned out to be familiar with her content and chided his friend by stating that she was a TikTok creator and that her hair loss was because she was sick. “It showed me that people help. Sharing my story does help, because what if out there in a secondary school, there’s someone with alopecia?” said Ms Tay. As for any advice she might have to those who want to try being similarly open or vulnerable online, Ms Tay said: “With every (piece of) content, I think quite a bit before I post. You must make sure that you are comfortable, it shouldn’t be something that’s pressuring.” “A digital footprint is a very real thing, I’m pretty sure there’s a video of me putting tattoos on my head that will be there forever, when I’m 60 I’ll probably have to look at it,” she added with a laugh. “I’m comfortable, that’s why I share it. So don’t feel like you have to do it, because there’s a lot of different ways you can advocate for things, without putting your face in front of the camera.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — Most of us can agree that stress is a constant in this modern life, and we are also increasingly aware that taking a moment to pause and check in on ourselves is important to our mental health. To those seeking calm amid our endlessly busy lives, meditation is often offered up as a way to ground ourselves. Studies have also shown the benefits of meditation in reducing stress and anxiety, increasing focus and boosting sleep. No surprise then, that a gamut of meditation apps have flooded the app market to provide everyone from meditation novices to seasoned practitioners with convenient ways to zen out. It can be intimidating to get started when there is so much information out there and so many options to choose from. And so I decided to try out some of the most popular meditation and wellness apps out there to find out which may be best for different segments of the population. I measured the apps based their cost, features, intuitiveness and overall experience. After a week of meditating and hearing soothing voices asking me to close my eyes and focus on my breath, I’ve concluded that finding the right meditation app is a personal journey. Whether you prefer an evidence-based approach or more gentle, mindful ways to move, there is an app that understands and caters to your needs. One of the most well-known apps on the market, Headspace caters to all levels, with introductory courses all the way to more advanced sessions for long-time meditators. The app offers various structured courses that require users to spend a maximum of 10 minutes a day, from learning the basics of meditation to more targeted courses dealing with issues such as work stress and anxiety. If courses are too much of a commitment, there are also emotion-based single sessions, such as a 10-minute guided meditation for when you are feeling frustrated or gearing up for a difficult conversation. Headspace also offers Sleepcasts, soothing audio to help users fall asleep, as well as animated videos that explain meditation techniques in an engaging way. The app's Mindful Workouts series combines physical exercises and dance with mindfulness practices. For example, their Mindful Cardio series makes running or jogging an intentional and mindful exercise. During the 10-minute run, the coach guides you to check in with your body and notice your surroundings. I enjoyed being especially present during the exercise and aware of both my mind and body working together. I left the short session feeling energised and my mind also felt more alert. My experience with Headspace was a breeze. The app's intuitive design and vast library of content made my meditation journey a delightful exploration. Cost: 14-day free trial, S$17.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription 10 Percent Happier is designed for people who may be skeptical of meditation and want to learn the science behind it, or those who prefer a more practical approach to the practice. The app offers videos that break down the psychology behind feelings such as stress, anxiety and phobias, and offer guided meditation sessions related to each video. These in-depth mindfulness and mental health courses are led by experienced meditation experts, including authors of mindfulness books and academics who teach mindfulness courses at universities. The app also has videos of interviews and talks with meditation experts for those who want to understand the nuts and bolts of the practice. Personally, I found 10 Percent Happier’s courses helpful in learning about meditation from those in the field. I like that there is a short and engaging video that preps you before each meditation session. Their single meditation session also covers a variety of topics taught by different experts, something I quite enjoyed. For single meditation sessions, users can choose the length of the session, which can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 45 minutes. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$19.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription Another well-known meditation app, Calm, features guided meditations focusing on stress management, anxiety, and sleep. Like Headspace, Calm offers content such as soundscapes, sleep stories and guided breathwork and meditation sessions. A defining feature of Calm is the Daily Calm session. Each day the app offers up a 10-minute meditation session that is weaved together with a story. The app has also started offering mindful stretching and light exercise guides called the Daily Move, nuggets of wisdom titled the Daily Jay, and a more fun meditation to start your day with the Daily Trip. A unique feature of Calm's Sleep Stories is that they are sometimes narrated by famous personalities. I found the Sleep Stories read by Harry Styles and Cillian Murphy especially soothing, while Lebron James's session on training your mind is a masterclass in focus and how to build mental strength. The strength of Calm is its collaboration with actors and singers to add a mindful slant to content you might be familiar with. For example, the app has an hour-long track by American singer-songwriter JVKE entitled \"This Is What Sleep Sounds Like\", a riff on his album track titles. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$78.98 annual subscription, S$599,98 one-time lifetime subscription Down Dog is a fitness app that includes meditation and breathwork exercises. You can tailor your meditation sessions by choosing the length, focus and background sounds to suit your preferences. The app integrates seamlessly with Down Dog’s other fitness apps, which offer guided yoga, HIIT and barre exercises. A subscription to Down Dog gives you access to all of these apps. Down Dog is probably more well-suited to people who are already familiar with meditation and want to be able to jump into a session without any extra videos or frills to sit through. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$14.48 monthly subscription, S$88.98 yearly subscription Insight Timer is an app with an extensive library of guided sessions and a strong community approach. The app includes a customisable meditation timer with ambient sounds, structured courses and workshops, and a strong community aspect, allowing users to connect with others and join interest-based groups. Meditation should not have to cost an arm and a leg and Insight Timer is one of the few apps that offers a free version that allows users access to more than 146,000 guided meditations, talks, podcasts, and music tracks. The free version does not include access to the app's courses, offline listening, or the ability to rewind or fast-forward. I was impressed by the variety of guides available on the app —in addition to the usual courses on issues such as stress and anxiety, boundaries and productivity, the app even offers meditation courses on topics such as beauty and ageing. Insight Timer's seemingly endless library of guides can be overwhelming for those just starting out, but if you are looking to further your practice or uncover other parts of yourself, this would be a good app to dive into. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$13.48 monthly subscription, S$81.98 yearly subscription As someone who tries to keep up with her meditation practice, this experiment in trying out various apps was a helpful to see what works for me. I was already subscribed to Calm for its accessible Daily Calm practice and Sleep Stories, but now I'm considering a subscription to 10 Percent Happier too. I feel that its evidence-based approach, complemented by informative documentary-style videos, not only enhances my practice but also deepens my understanding of meditation. That said, what is right for me may not be the best choice for everyone else. So I suggest you close your eyes, focus on your breath and start your own exploration of the world of meditation.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Instead of attending preschool like other children his age, four-year-old Atlas Wong, who was named after his parents' passion for travel, is doing his learning while flying across the globe. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Instead of attending preschool like other children his age , four-year-old Atlas Wong, who was named after his parents' passion for travel , is doing his learning while flying across the globe. Over the last four months, he has travelled to 22 countries including Belgium, France, Greece and Turkiye. His jet-setting life will continue until he is six, with destinations such as Canada, Japan and the United States still to come. His parents, civil servants Rakcent Wong, 35, and Carol Tan, 36, came up with the 50-country list after they promised each other that they would take their child on \"worldly adventures\" before he started formal school. Mr Wong, who like his wife is on a two-year sabbatical from his job, said: \"Atlas means a bundle of maps. Since we already planned to travel around the world, we thought this would be an appropriate name (for him).\" Before Atlas was born, Mr Wong and his wife frequently embarked on short trips overseas. With every trip, the couple said that they learned more about themselves and the cultures in the places they visited. He added: “Travelling has such a strong transformative power, and we want to gift it to our child despite people telling us that we should stop travelling after having a kid.” When I first heard about their two-year sojourn after chancing upon their joint Instagram account Engaging Atlas, I was in awe. The idea of taking time off from work and life to travel seemed so out of reach for an average working adult. Yet here they were, somehow managing to \"live the dream\" with their young son, determined to show him places I might not get to visit in my lifetime. Apart from myself, more than 11,500 followers eagerly tune in to get a glimpse of their adventures through the account, meticulously curated by Atlas' parents. Every day, the couple sets out with their phone camera, capturing various sights, sounds and experiences. Each video is marked with a country flag and the day of their travel so that viewers may easily track when and where the family has been. That was why when I arranged to meet them online on a FaceTime video-call, I had a question that I was dying to ask: How in the world are they able to do all this? To my question, Ms Tan said that their two-year trip is being funded from their savings, which they accumulated from living frugally for five years from the time before Atlas was born. “We set this five-year target because we thought Atlas should be more independent by then. “He should be able to eat on his own and walk a bit further, and when we come back, it would be just in time for primary school. So we felt this was the right time,” Mr Wong said. The family was in Cyprus at the time when we spoke. This week, they are in Nepal. After doing their sums, the couple calculated that the trip would cost them an average of S$150 a day, inclusive of the cost of flight tickets. Mr Wong admitted that it was tough at the start because he had to really scrutinise his wife’s finances. “She appreciates the finer things in life,” he said with a laugh. Ms Tan said that before they made this decision to travel for an extended period of time, she led a more indulgent lifestyle and had no qualms about splurging on cafe food and branded bags every now and then. “After that, I realised I wasn’t truly happy even when I spent on these items. Travelling, however, gave me a different perspective on life. So I changed my mindset to focus on valuable experiences instead of materials, and I managed to save up for our financial goal of travelling,” she added. The couple do not own a car and have been living in a four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat since 2016, before Atlas was born. They mostly ate cheap hawker food and relied on public transport to get around, and made it a point to take the cheapest flights available over the course of their two-year journey. Even with such decisions, it was a trade-off that was unpalatable to some, the couple told me. “Our parents were very supportive because they knew how free-spirited and adventurous we are. But our friends, especially our colleagues, told us we should stop our adventures now that we have a kid,\" Ms Tan said. These comments did not deter the couple but spurred them instead to push ahead with their plans, even if it meant forgoing income and the ability for Atlas' grandparents to see him in person for two years. Their journey started on Jan 17 when they left Singapore for Greece. The couple decided that this would be their first location for practical reasons — they managed to snag cheap flight tickets for about S$300 a person. There, they visited the black sand beach in the island of Santorini, where the sand is made of volcanic material and lava fragments, and witnessed the sunset at the picturesque village of Oia. Since then, they have visited more than 20 places in Europe, including Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. These were places that I had only read about or seen on television, but never in real life. Truth be told, I was more amazed than envious, because it wasn't that I couldn't afford to travel to these dreamy locales, but it was just an unimaginable thought that I would have to set aside my commitments to be abroad. Also, for a start, travelling to all these places with a young child in tow sounded tiring. However, as Mr Wong and Ms Tan regaled me with tales of their epic travels, it was hard to tell that they were suffering from any travel fatigue. Right before our FaceTime session at 1pm Singapore time, the pair told me that they had not slept in 24 hours. The couple had just reached Cyprus — it was 8am over there — after braving a red-eye (overnight) flight from Turkiye the night before. Yet, to my eyes, I could hardly detect any homesickness or exhaustion, as the couple excitedly shared how their next steps would take them to Nepal, where they plan to stay for a month to maximise their travel visa validity period there. As to exactly where they will be, Mr Wong said that they have no concrete itinerary or plan in place, except that they have to be in Kenya by July because that is the best time for a safari visit. At this point, I thought about how the longest I've been away from home for travels was two weeks. I cannot fathom ever needing to extend a trip just so I could get the most out of my travel visa. After all, I am not someone who can live without Asian cuisine for more than two days. Mr Wong and Ms Tan said that coping with the lack of Singapore food was one of the hardest moments they had to experience during their global adventure. Two weeks after departing Singapore, Atlas asked for char siew (barbecued pork) rice. “Char siew rice was his comfort food because we would have it once every three to four days. It was so easy to 'dabao' (Chinese for take-away) when the stall was just downstairs,\" Ms Tan said, recalling that this happened while they were in North Macedonia. “I felt so bad because I couldn’t find char siew rice for him. His diet was my biggest concern.” Refusing to be defeated by this, she then sought to level up her cooking skills in order to whip up Singapore meals for Atlas and her husband whenever they wanted a taste of home. To the couple, the most challenging part of their journey was not related to finances, pausing their careers or navigating new places. Rather, it was having to be a good parent to Atlas while coping with travel anxieties. \"Parenting is always a challenge,\" Mr Wong said. \"Balancing it with travel and other responsibilities adds an extra layer of difficulty, especially when we're on our own out here.\" He and his wife admitted that the journey so far has not been all butterflies and rainbows. \"But we embraced the journey as a family, knowing it would be the most rewarding part,\" Mr Wong added. At the end of the day, the trip is not meant for the couple to indulge themselves, they said. It was conceived from the start to give Atlas an enriching adventure. To this, Mr Wong recalled how, in Lyon, France, their son saw the exposed mechanism of a cable car and decided to pepper his parents with questions about it. Far from being put off, Mr Wong said that hearing the boy's questions put to rest any doubts that they had when they first decided to embark on their journey. “Atlas stood there and watched cable cars go up and down for a good 10 minutes. He asked specific questions like, ‘How does this work? Why is it like this?’ “We thought this would be a good skill that he could use further in life because when you learn things, you need to know the reasons why. And when you’re curious, that’s when your knowledge will expand,” Ms Tan said. Asked if she was worried about how Atlas may fit into Singapore's primary school system when he reaches six, Ms Tan admitted that her son might not be \"used to sitting down\". “But with this sense of wonder he has shown throughout the trip, I’m sure he will become an effective learner when he’s older,” she said. I wish I could've seen Atlas on camera, but he was sound asleep at their lodging in Cyprus given that their red-eye flight was just hours before. I couldn't help thinking how it was so good that he has parents who believed that life lessons are best learned through exploration and exposure, and who were willing to pause their own lives to grant him a memorable childhood. It should go without saying that such a sojourn may not be for everyone, but a little part of me wonders if I would have had a different worldview had I gone on such a trip at Atlas' age. As the famed American zoologist Jack Hanna once said: \"The world is the true classroom. The most rewarding and important type of learning is through experience, seeing something with our own eyes.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — For 37-year-old Timothy Wee, he is drawn to zines because of the “connection and intimacy” they bring, and their tactility that a digital screen cannot replicate. Mr Timothy Wee, a lecturer and an avid zine collector, at the Lasalle College of Arts on May 23, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — For 37-year-old Timothy Wee, he is drawn to zines because of the “connection and intimacy” they bring, and their tactility that a digital screen cannot replicate. “The screen is great — you can add interactions and all that — but this is very tactile and, I feel, intimate. Only one person can read it at a time,” he said. The lecturer in design communication at Lasalle College of the Arts has collected zines focused on skateboarding and photography for more than a decade. Zines, or fanzines, refer to independently published magazines that are often non-commercial and homemade or self-published in small circulation numbers. Today, Mr Wee’s collection runs from zines he has sourced both here and overseas to ones he has self-published, and even zines created by his students. The zines are largely centred on his hobbies of skateboarding and photography, though he also owns zines that cover topics such as living in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic and dealing with grief and regret over the loss of a loved one. Passion for printed magazines and its subset of zines — shared by readers and collectors such as Mr Wee — has been brought to the forefront in recent weeks. When Holland Village icon and landmark Thambi Magazine Store shuttered on May 5 after more than 80 years in business, there was a public outpouring of sadness and empathy, with many questioning what the future of print magazines would be. Publishers and collectors in Singapore, however, told TODAY that they believe it is unlikely that demand for zines and printed magazines would be completely stamped out anytime soon. While he described Thambi’s closure as “bittersweet”, Mr Wee said: “I’m not really afraid of the printed matter dying out, because there will always be people who want to keep it, or who desire that connection and intimacy — that physical interaction of handing someone a zine that they bought from you or you buying a zine from someone.” And Mr Wee is not alone in having such sentiments. Project manager Sasitharan Alphonse, 43, has bought and subscribed to various print magazines for several years, including The New Yorker, Literary Review, The Atlantic and Time magazines. For the last two to three years, he has subscribed to physical copies of international film magazine Sight and Sound despite it being more expensive than an online subscription of the same. He picks up his monthly subscription in-person from the Basheer Graphics bookstore at Bras Basah Complex, because it also gives him the opportunity to browse other magazines on display. “For me, it gives some sort of emotional attachment when you hold the magazines in your hand,” Mr Alphonse said, adding that he prefers to collect and physically display magazines where it is content that he especially enjoys. This has led him to continue buying printed magazines in spite of the space constraints he has at home. Mr Alphonse said that the issue of what to do next with his growing collection is something he constantly faces, but he ultimately does not see himself moving away from printed magazines anytime soon. “I still prefer to have it in hand. Anytime I want to, I can go back and see it for reference.” Many people in the community believe that the love for the printed magazine is still very much alive. Writer and translator Alicia Tan, who created zines between 2014 and 2018 as part of the creative duo Supponstar, said: “Printed magazines and zines really engage all your senses. “The thickness and texture of the paper used, the smell of ink, the vibrancy of the colours, the sound the paper makes when you flip a page — all matter.” A 38-year-old tutor who wanted to be known only as Madam Diana said: “I cannot read digital articles for long. “If it’s a very short article on Instagram — say two paragraphs — I’m still able to read it online. But once the content gets pretty heavy, I need to hold it in my hand.” Agreeing, 21-year-old university student Charles Toh said: “Even just tiny things like feeling yourself turn a page, set a book down, or put it aside, these are what occupies a definitive sense of physical space. “As things get more digitalised and virtual, these ground us in our own reality and make us feel human.” Members of the community said that a key appeal of printed magazines and zines is also how they connect people, often those who share a mutual love for the same subculture. “When you are the person selling the zine, you know who is receiving it,” Mr Wee said. “Most of my zines are collected through fairs, so when I buy it from a fair, I’m seeing the person who created it and I’m talking to them and connecting with them on that level as well.” Mr Pann Lim, 51, whose family of four has collectively created the Rubbish Famzines series since 2013, said that they also try to take part in the Singapore Art Book Fair every year. The co-founder and creative director of design and advertising agency Kinetic Singapore added: “We have even seen some of our readers grow from singles to now becoming married, and some of them even have kids. “We know that we are just doing (the zines) for us, but other than us, there are also people who are looking forward to the next issue. And I think that’s a really good reason for us to keep making them.” Mr Abdul Nasser, the owner of Basheer Graphics bookstore, said that the shop’s sales of printed magazines have fallen over the years, but there continues to be a steady demand for independently published zines. Such a trend is inevitable, especially since some of the more commercialised printed magazines have gone online and ceased their print run, he noted. Many zines, however, are handmade or self-produced and often only available as physical copies. They are also limited in quantities, and so are sought after as collectibles, he added. Agreeing, Ms Tan said that Supponstar had seen interest and sales for zines rise in recent years, compared to when it first started out in 2014. “We didn’t sell many copies in the 2014 Tokyo Art Book Fair, aside from our bilingual The Underwear Zine, but we saw a significant rise in sales when we took up a booth at the 2018 Singapore Art Book Fair.” The duo is currently on hiatus, though Ms Tan said that they are in talks about possibly restarting their zine-making. “There’s definitely a market and demand for zines with either a unique point of view or construction. But consumers are a lot more discerning because honestly, there’s a glut of media right now,” she added. Regardless, Mr Nasser believes that there will always be a demand for the medium of printed magazines and zines, even if it is just within a niche community. Likening it to some consumers’ love for vinyl records alongside the growth of online music streaming platforms, Mr Nasser said that there will always be people who will continue to buy printed magazines and zines purely because they value it. Today, there is still a growing crowd of zine creators in Singapore who are keeping the tradition alive. One of them is Singaporean poet and editor Tse Hao Guang, 36, who turned to the medium to rally support for emerging writers’ works. Mr Tse is working with a team of other writers and designers to produce three upcoming literary zines — a “pamphlet series” titled Paper Jam — that will be launched on June 8. He said that the zine would mainly feature different works in poetry, flash fiction and short fiction. The team will kick off their maiden zine in June with a 100-copy print run for each of the three pamphlets. After that, they intend to release new issues of the literary zine yearly. While it is still early days for the team, Mr Tse said that the zine’s pre-order figures are “healthy”. “As long as there are good ideas and people working in print, I think zines and other printed matter will continue to flourish,” he added. Agreeing, Mr Lim of Rubbish Famzines said: “Everything can go digital, of course, but we cannot forget the experience of having a physical zine or magazine in front of you — flipping the book, the smell, and everything.” “It’s just like if you get a food delivery rider to send a cup of latte to you, versus you being at a cafe where you like the ambience, the interior design, and you are having a chat with your friend… The experience will never be the same.” With print matter getting scarcer today, Mr Lim who is trained as a print designer desires to keep the tradition alive. “I think print will still be around, because there are many people who love it. But personally, I feel the craft of print will get more scarce. “So for me, being a person in this industry for close to 25 years doing print, all the more I want to keep it alive… and to also share it with the young.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Despite years of trying to lose weight, Mr Benedict Leong struggled to shed the excess fat around his chest and could not understand why. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Despite years of trying to lose weight, Mr Benedict Leong struggled to shed the excess fat around his chest and could not understand why. The 30-year-old who runs a pet service business has been dedicating himself to intermittent fasting and various exercises, seeing improvements elsewhere in his body, but the weight around his chest stubbornly remained and even seemed more prominent. “My entire life, I’ve been told, ‘You’re a bit heavy' or 'You’ve gained weight'. So I thought anything that looks fat means that it’s just a weight-related problem.” Feeling like he had hit a wall, he decided to visit the doctor, where he was diagnosed with gynaecomastia or enlargement of the male breast tissue. Colloquially, this is sometimes called \"man boobs\" or just \"moobs\", though these are not terms that medical professionals tend to use. The impact of the condition is mainly psychological, though it can also cause discomfort for some. For Mr Leong, it was both a surprise and a relief to know that it was a medical condition and had nothing to do with weight. Moreover, it can be easily treated with day surgery with very little downtime. “I realised that it’s not my fault. It wasn’t that I was not doing enough,” he added. “I didn’t realise it is a condition that can be rectified.” “I decided to go and do it (the surgery) and ever since then, I’ve been feeling great.” He went for surgery in February. Mr Leong is not alone when it comes to gynaecomastia. Doctors contacted by TODAY said that they have been seeing an increase in men, especially those in their 20s to 30s, visiting their clinics to seek treatment for the condition. There are no official statistics for the number of men being treated here, but one doctor said that based on international studies, on average, 60 per cent of men worldwide exhibit gynaecomastia to some degree. Dr Ivan Puah, medical director of Amaris B Clinic, added: “The prevalence of asymptomatic gynaecomastia is 50 per cent to 60 per cent in adolescents and up to 70 per cent in men who are 50 to 69 years old.” Asymptomatic gynaecomastia refers to cases of gynaecomastia that occur in men with no identifiable cause. Dr Samuel Ho from Allure Plastic Surgery said that although there seems to be an increase in men going for gynaecomastia treatment, this does not necessarily indicate a prevalence of the condition in Singapore but rather a greater incidence of it. “(The number of cases) probably has increased over the years because of awareness,” he added. Dr Ho noted that he has seen more cases in the last five years. Indeed, on the online forum Reddit, there are several threads from online users in Singapore discussing their experience and sharing information about gynaecomastia. Users on the thread shared insights into which clinic they prefer, the cost of surgery and share post-operative experiences. Dr Puah said that even with online discussion, there is a stigma that stops men from seeking treatment. “Men may be hesitant to seek medical help or discuss their concerns due to fear of judgment or embarrassment.” Dr Ho said: “Just because you’re aware doesn’t mean you would want to get treated because sometimes, they may not know that there are treatment options.” As common and benign as gynaecomastia is, it is still a widely misunderstood condition. TODAY asked the doctors and patients to shed some much-needed light on the topic. Broadly, there are two causes of gynaecomastia: Physiological and pathological. Dr Samuel Ho from Allure Plastic Surgery said that physiological gynaecomastia is usually caused by a shift in hormones that occurs during two stages in a man’s life. “So it is periods of a lot of hormonal shifts. That's the age groups when they are post-pubertal (in their youth) and when they are post-andropausal in their 50s and 60s.” Dr Ho also said that it is extremely common for boys going through puberty to develop gynaecomastia, where up to 70 to 80 per cent experience it. However, there is a chance that it can resolve by itself and surgery might not be needed. Andropause, often referred to as male menopause, is a phase in a man's life typically associated with a gradual decline in testosterone levels, usually in middle-aged and older men. As for pathological gynaecomastia, it is usually caused by medication, illness or the use of anabolic steroids. Doctors told TODAY that some medications can have side effects that cause gynaecomastia, including antidepressants and calcium channel blockers. Dr Ivan Puah from Amaris B Clinic said there is a myth that gynaecomastia affects only overweight or obese individuals, and it is not true. “Gynaecomastia can occur in individuals of any body weight,” he added. “While excess fat can contribute to the appearance of enlarged breasts, hormonal imbalances and other factors can also cause gynaecomastia in individuals who are not overweight.” Doctors who spoke to TODAY said that the treatment for gynaecomastia is quite straightforward and can be done in an hour or two. A patient undergoing this surgery typically goes through the usual processes of physical examinations, blood tests and ultrasound tests to determine and confirm the diagnosis. Gynaecomastia is classified into four grades, with the first grade being the less noticeable to the fourth grade being the most pronounced and breast-like. Most often, the surgery involves a small incision of 2cm around the areola (area around the nipple) to remove the breast disc and some fat. The technique varies from plastic surgeon to plastic surgeon and is also dependent on the patient’s condition. Dr Tan Chuan Chien, consultant general surgeon of breast and thyroid surgery at SOG Health, said that medical advancement, minimally invasive surgical techniques and improved medical therapies are some of the emerging trends in gynaecomastia treatment. “These advancements offer better surgical outcomes and quicker recovery times for patients.” Dr Ho said that some patients can go back to work the next day if they want to, and most patients can return to physical exercise after a week. Mr Leong said of his experience: “I think the first few days, there was just a bit of discomfort because it’s a wound. “We do have to wear the compression garment, which took a while to get used to, but I think after about a week, I was fine.” The cost of surgery varies depending on the clinic, but it can cost anywhere from S$15,000 to S$20,000. However, because it is a medical condition, it is fully covered by the Central Provident Fund's MediSave or by an insurance provider. For Mr Leong, his surgery cost S$15,000 and was completely covered by his insurance. “That was something that was pleasantly surprising,” he said. “I didn't know that this can be covered under insurance as a legitimate medical condition.” Dr Ho said: “The guys that go through it will discover that the whole process is quite simple. \"It is the ‘before’ of getting to the consulting room that really hampers them.” Even though gynaecomastia is a physical condition, its psychological effects are more than skin-deep, and an hour’s surgery can make a world of difference. For Mr Leong, who had always been insecure about how his chest looked, he was more than thrilled to wake up to a flatter chest. “Immediately after the surgery, when I looked at myself, I said, 'Wow, that is a major change’ because I’ve always seen myself with protruding chest.” There is a level of “social embarrassment” for men when their chest does not conform to a certain ideal. Mr Leong added: “For men, there has always been a major focus on the upper body, on the chest and the abs. That’s generally the first thing when we try to draw the ‘perfect’ physique for a male.” This was compounded by the subliminal messages that Mr Leong received during his schooling days, where the guys in sports co-curricular activities were “favoured” by people in general. He himself was in drama club as the “artsy fartsy kid”. “Everybody was perpetuating a particular kind of ‘look’, especially with certain celebrities that look a certain way, and everybody would fawn over them... So I think subconsciously, all these bits and pieces start formulating an idea of what a man should look like.” In the Reddit post about gynaecomastia surgery, a user named “Queasy-Wear-1” said that he was “depressed” because of his gynaecomastia. He commented: “Every shirt you wear can see those puffy sharp nipples, which is very awkward so I end up slouching hard so it was not obvious. I can’t go swimming with friends, I can’t go shirtless. So there are a lot of (things) I can’t (do) there was no confidence at all.” Singapore, like many other societies, has certain body image ideals for men, Dr Puah said. “The emphasis on a lean and muscular physique often leads to increased concern or dissatisfaction among men with gynaecomastia.” Still, the condition is extremely common and treatable, Dr Tan said. The majority of those who undergo the surgery, like Mr Leong, are very happy with the results. “When I look at myself in the mirror, I feel great,” Mr Leong said, “and I know that it won’t come back.” “I can continue to work on other things that I want to work on in my life. It’s not just an emotional relief but also a mental release for myself.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — General practitioner (GP) Samuel Choudhury has amassed a vast 400,000 followers on TikTok through his account \"skingapore\", but what is curious about them is that most of his videos feature only the left half of his face. Dr Sam — as he prefers to be known — is now a natural in front of the camera as he shares content on medical matters and health, but he told TODAY how his acne scars had initially made him insecure about how he looked. The scars, which are barely visible to the casual observer, are from an aesthetic treatment that left complications on the right side of his face, which is why he prefers to show mainly the left half of his face in his videos. “I suffered since (my time in the) army because of camo(uflage) that gave me very bad acne. And then throughout medical school, acne also caused a lot of confidence issues,” he said. He went through bouts of acne treatment to treat the condition, which thankfully did not return, he added. After that, he underwent an aesthetic procedure to try to get rid of a scar on the right side of his face but the treatment caused more complications. “The complications from the procedure happened when I first started my TikTok journey and it affected my confidence a bit because I had to be on camera,\" he said. Over time, though, exposure on the video-sharing platform gradually helped to boost his confidence and made him more comfortable in his own skin. “It was only one year after I started TikTok that I didn’t use filters on my videos because I just felt like it was not worth the hassle. So after a while, I started to accept that and move on.\" The educational videos that Dr Sam shares deal with a range of medical and health matters, with a focus perhaps unsurprisingly on skincare, as well as eye health. Some content such as his “New Fear Unlocked” series — where he outlines instructive medical cases so that his followers can avoid committing the same medical mistakes — has racked up more than a million views. His most popular video to date, about a teenager in the United States who contracted hookworms after burying himself in sand on a Florida beach, has a whopping 16.5 million views. In his day job as a GP in family medicine, Dr Sam deals with patients grappling with illnesses ranging from menstrual cramps and diarrhoea to chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Working on the medical frontline gives him some ideas on the content he puts out on TikTok. “Usually I would drive in silence and I would think to myself, ‘Okay, what happened today in the clinic that was interesting? What did patients ask me, or what were they shocked by?’ \"If somebody questioned me about (something), then it means probably a lot of people have the same concerns, then I would do a video about it,” he said. “Being a GP gives me the opportunity to talk about everything, because you need to know everything. Breadth of (knowledge on) medicine is very important as a GP.” To create a video, Dr Sam said that he can spend six to eight hours solely on research to ensure that the information he puts out is factual and accurate. Filming the video takes up to 45 minutes, while the final editing takes up two hours. “Most of the effort comes from preparation to ensure that the content is accurate. There were times when I would do a story and realise that, ‘Oh, this article is a hoax’ and I had to scrap it.” In his journey as a content creator, Dr Sam has had his share of interesting encounters with his followers, including his haters. Talking about how he would look through the comments on all his videos for feedback, Dr Sam recounted the case of one user who would \"post a long reply every time (I) posted about skincare\". \"I could tell that he knew what he was saying and he probably works in the industry.\" Dr Sam said that he later attended an event and introduced himself to a makeup artist who was promoting a skincare line, who then told Dr Sam that he was the user who had been leaving those comments on his videos. “After that, we went out for coffee, then we talked about it, and now we’re friends,” Dr Sam said, adding that his hater-turned-friend would also take him to beauty product store Sephora to pick out makeup products. When he receives messages from his followers thanking him, Dr Sam said that he feels a sense of fulfilment, citing the example of a video he made about the dangers of feeding honey to infants aged under a year old. A grandmother sent him a message thanking him for the video, saying that she was not aware of this and would forward the video to her family to ensure that the boy did not eat honey. Dr Sam said: “All these messages and comments would make me feel like it was the right decision to make these videos and I’ll be motivated to find more interesting things to make content. “When I see the content that I put out is having an impact on the lives of people around the world, it is very fulfilling and meaningful because this is the definition of public health, whereby I can have an impact on the lives of people beyond my clinic. This is the wonderful invention of social media.\" Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — As someone who struggles to stay focused, anytime I set out to finish a task, it often looks like this: I put down my cup of coffee, turn on my computer, and then end up scrolling on my phone for the next 20 minutes. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — As someone who struggles to stay focused, anytime I set out to finish a task, it often looks like this: I put down my cup of coffee, turn on my computer, and then end up scrolling on my phone for the next 20 minutes. Then in an effort to make my day more productive, I start rearranging my room or doing other things, except what I had set out to do. Then surprise! The panic over the deadline sets in and I get a boost of productivity at night. Suddenly, my work is completed, and I finally go to sleep at 7am. There lies the problem: In rushing to meet my deadline, I have sacrificed sleep, proper meals and even a daily shower. The accumulation of insufficient sleep and poor nutrition often led to me crashing after each deadline. It also left me feeling too tired to socialise and I end up losing precious time with family and friends. I know precisely the problem: I procrastinate too much. So how should I regain my balance and manage this better? Mental health experts I consulted said that there are broadly four reasons people procrastinate: Boredom, low self-confidence, a lack of competence and stress. Finding a task boring, or being overwhelmed by the complexity of the task, can cause one to stall for time. Not having the skills to tackle the assignment or feeling the pressure to finish it can also lead to procrastination. Then there are other things that people deem as important, but which can be a source of distraction. Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters psychological consultancy firm, said: “Tidying up your room or checking your emails are important. Socialising and having a nap can contribute positively to your mental health. “These may not seem like procrastination, but any task can (cause procrastination) when it is one that we use to distract ourselves from our task or goal.” Experts said that it is normal to procrastinate, that it is okay to take breaks while on a task. Ms Amelia Mak from Heartscape Psychology clinic said: “Our limited attention span makes focusing on a task for long periods of time challenging.” Procrastination can even enhance productivity when the deadline draws nearer or when there is heightened concentration, Dr Yang said. However, it becomes an obstacle when excessive procrastination leads to missed deadlines or must-do assignments remain incomplete. At its most extreme, people start to “deny things are important to them” such as school or work, Dr Yang added. Procrastination becomes more than just being unproductive when it harms one’s well-being or their relationships with others. Negative effects can also come in the form of insufficient sleep, heightened stress and anxiety as deadlines approach and no progress has been made. The key in regulating procrastination is self-awareness, the experts said. Understanding “how” and “why” one is procrastinating can help with managing the emotions that come with a task. “It is important to set aside periodic breaks from tasks so it is intentional and not merely to procrastinate,” Dr Yang said. Ms Mak advised: “Be reflective on your own procrastination habits and understand these triggers or any patterns to specific tasks.” This means that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to procrastination, but it should instead be adapted to individual preferences and habits. I have tried several ways to deal with my habit of procrastinating: Using the timer application Pomodoro, turning to Study-With-Me videos and putting my phone aside. In the end, I had found them ineffective after a while and, after speaking with the experts, I now know why. So, I decided to give the three methods another try, timing how long it took me to write a 500-word article with each of these methods. Only this time, I tailored them to my individual routines. Pomodoro is a timer app that breaks up work into intervals of 25 minutes followed by a short break. It helps arrange time to provide intentional breaks for people to refresh themselves between study sessions. Ms Mak advised that the time intervals should be fitted within the individual’s threshold of attention. So I tried a 35-minute focused session with a five-minute rest, which suits me as I reached the break just as my focus was running out. I was able to finish my task in two hours and 23 minutes. However, having my phone beside me as a timer made it difficult to resist using my phone. As time dragged on, my attention span waned and the 35 minutes started to feel too long. Study-With-Me videos are made by creators who film themselves studying while inviting others to join them. Having environmental cues can help in facilitating focus and create a sense of belonging with the shared struggle of having to get work done. Using this method, I completed the task in the shortest time: One hour and 18 minutes. Watching live comments of how others were also struggling with their work helped reduce the stress that I felt from doing the task. Being able to interact with others in the comments also helped me deal with boredom. The only downside was the occasional advertisement that popped up. Phones can be a major distraction so I tried putting it out of my reach until I completed the task. This was more effective than Pomodoro and it took me one hour and 29 minutes to finish the task. I was able to resist the impulse to check my phone whenever I felt stressed and took a walk around my house when I was tired. However, this method is not always feasible for me since there are times where I need my phone for work. While I found the most success with the Study-With-Me videos, experts said that one can try out different methods and adjust them accordingly. “Most importantly, allow for self-compassion and acknowledge that setbacks may occur in trying to kick the habit of procrastination,” Ms Mak said. Although these solutions don’t guarantee that I will always be productive, it has reduced the amount of time I spend on a task and allowed me to reconnect with my family and friends.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Think \"nurses\" and most people would picture health professionals bustling around a busy, sterile hospital setting. It is time, though, to broaden that notion now with the emergence of a growing number of community nurses. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Think \"nurses\" and most people would picture health professionals bustling around a busy, sterile hospital setting. It is time, though, to broaden that notion now with the emergence of a growing number of community nurses. For Ms Wee Ai Ling, the sphere of work for nursing extends far beyond hospital walls, encompassing a vital role often performed far from the public eye. The 31-year-old is a hospital-to-home community nurse with the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), whose work revolves around managing patients who are discharged from the hospital because they are well enough to go home. The community nursing programme places an emphasis on preventive health and the empowerment of patients to take charge of their health. Piloted in 2018, it has become a permanent feature of the healthcare scene here. Ms Wee is part of a growing cadre of healthcare professionals who play this crucial role in delivering holistic care and support to patients beyond the hospital environment. Like their hospital peers, these nurses wear uniforms. The number of community nurses at various health service providers has jumped over recent years as the role became more integral to the health system. The number under the National University Healthcare System (NUHS) — which includes National University Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Alexandra Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital — rose from 10 in 2017 to about 50 in 2023, CNA news channel reported last year. Tan Tock Seng Hospital has seen its numbers more than double from about 20 nurses in 2018, while Singapore General Hospital has 82, up from 34 in 2018. Ms Wee said in an interview with TODAY: \"Nowadays, due to the Healthier SG initiative, everything is about preventive health and empowerment. \"You do very little on (preventive health) when you are working in the hospital environment, but when I work in the community, I am able to empower my patient to take charge of their own health and to stay well.'' When I prepared to meet Ms Wee on a recent Monday morning, I expected a chatty, outgoing individual given that interacting with a diverse number of people is part of her job. Instead, Ms Wee struck me at first as a meek and mild figure, her soft voice and quiet demeanour the complete opposite of what I had expected. She may have been unassuming in nature, but I got a better sense of her true character as I observed her conversing with a doctor about a patient. She readily answered the doctor's questions, offering insights and recommendations with precision and clarity. Perhaps her reticence stemmed from the presence of the TODAY photographer who was following her about in the busy office located in SingHealth Tower within the hospital grounds that was bustling with numerous other healthcare workers. Ms Wee's demeanour transformed entirely when we later accompanied her to visit a patient for a post-hospitalisation check-up. She become more cheerful and talkative when she spoke to him and his caregiver. Nursing was not Ms Wee's chosen vocation. She had graduated with a diploma in food science and technology, before taking on a nursing degree at the National University of Singapore (NUS). \"To be honest, I did not always want to be a nurse. I wanted to be a dietitian,\" she said. \"When I found out that I was eligible for a nursing degree offered by NUS, I decided to go for it and when school started, I fell in love with every aspect of nursing.\" Ms Wee added that her decision to study nursing was a leap of faith for her and came with a steep learning curve. \"It wasn't an easy switch from my food science and nutrition background into nursing, because most of my peers already had a nursing diploma, so they already had a nursing background to help them in their studies. Whereas for me, I had to start from scratch.\" She had to put in extra effort to catch up with her peers, especially in the practical aspects such as inserting a urine catheter. After graduating from university, Ms Wee was posted to the general surgery department of SGH for two years, before making the switch to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU), where she worked for another five years. The impetus to work in aftercare came from observing how some ICU patients required interventions to help them breathe, such as tracheostomy where a tube that carries air from the throat to the lungs through the front of the neck. Ms Wee said that she decided she would like to be involved in a patient's aftercare following such invasive procedures, so in August last year, she applied for the hospital-to-home programme in order to become a community nurse. \"Aftercare is what I would say is very critical for the patient because if they are unable to be taken care of well in the community, or their caregiver cannot take care of them well, then they will come back to the hospital for a lung infection very easily,\" she explained. \"Working in the ICU, we don't usually do discharge planning. So, by joining community nursing, I get to be involved in what will happen to the patients after they go back home.\" Ms Wee's job now involves doing phone and video consultations to follow up regularly with her patients after they are discharged, as well as conducting home visits to ensure that patients are recovering well or their caregivers are taking the correct steps to reduce complications. \"Now as a community nurse in the hospital-to-home programme, I find it rewarding to see patients take charge of their health and transit smoothly back into the community,\" she said. With most of her patients aged 80 and above, Ms Wee told me that she has to put extra effort into building rapport with them to convince them to change some of their ingrained habits. Some elders may be stubborn and resistant to change , she added. \"I once had a patient that smoked one pack (of cigarettes) a day and he had stage four lung cancer. So I had to spend quite a bit of time talking to the patient and explaining to him about the risks and consequences of smoking.\" At first, the patient did not take her advice well, but with regular follow-ups, she built rapport with the patient who eventually quit smoking. \"After all the home visits and the education that we gave him, he realised that he shouldn't be smoking so much since it can worsen his lung condition,\" she added. One way she builds rapport with patients is by speaking in the language and dialect in which they are most comfortable. Ms Wee told me that she is conversant in English, Mandarin, Malay and the Chinese dialect of Hokkien. There is the sense of fulfilment when patients are receptive to her advice, but there are bittersweet moments on the job as well. Recounting an incident where a patient of hers died shortly after one of her visits, Ms Wee said that the patient's daughter expressed her gratitude for the work she did. \"I checked in with the daughter and she was very appreciative, saying that thanks to our home visits, it helped them to know what to do when their father's condition worsened and to manage their father's last moments as well,\" she recalled. \"When I receive such compliments, I feel like I've made a difference and that our programme benefited them in the long run.\" As I followed Ms Wee on her rounds, I noticed her whole demeanour brightened when interacting with her patient, as she spoke in Mandarin, English and Hokkien so that the 90-year-old could better understand her. When I asked the man what he thought of Ms Wee's services, he gave a thumbs-up, saying in Mandarin: \"Very good! She helps me to take care of my health very well, she's very good.\" As our interview concluded and we made our way to the lift lobby, I observed that Ms Wee lingered behind to have a conversation with the patient's son-in-law. She pointed out the patient's slightly swollen feet and advised the younger man to seek medical attention promptly if he noticed any worsening of the patient's condition, leaving me impressed by her meticulous attention to detail and strong sense of responsibility towards her patients' well-being. My initial impression of Ms Wee's meekness and diffidence had transformed into a profound appreciation for her dedication and passion. Witnessing her light up while discussing patient care and her zealousness in every interaction, I could not help but feel inspired by her and have no doubt that she will continue to make a significant impact in her career.

    "article_content": "Features Youth motivational speaker Freddie Almazan speaking to TODAY on May 27, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. Warning: This article discusses suicide. SINGAPORE — Nov 11, 2006 should have been like any other day for 13-year-old Freddie Almazan. All he remembers is that he was walking home from school that afternoon. Then he woke up in the hospital a few weeks later. He had been shot in the back of his head on his walk home in California. Till today, he does not know who had shot him. The incident, however, left him partially paralysed. It also marked the start of what would be a decade-long battle with depression, before he eventually decided to turn his life around during his university years. Today, Mr Almazan, a youth motivational speaker, speaks extensively about how one can find “beauty in the broken pieces”, and thus grow and bounce back from the challenges one faces in life. Because he decided to share his story, his words also saved someone from suicide. Mr Almazan was speaking to TODAY on the sidelines of the Rotary International Convention 2024, where the 31-year-old is a conference speaker. Rotary is an international service organisation connecting more than 1.4 million volunteers from more than 46,000 Rotary clubs globally to tackle issues of concern. The organisation meets at the annual Rotary International Convention, which is held in a different city each year. This year’s convention was held in Singapore between May 25 and 29, and saw more than 14,000 Rotary members and participants from 151 countries and more gather at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands. Mr Almazan remembers little of what happened that afternoon in November 2006, apart from how much his life had changed as a result. “I just remember walking home and then a few weeks later, I remember waking up to what I thought was like a nightmare,” he said. He was surrounded by doctors at his bedside. They asked him several questions — including if he knew what the date was and if he could feel his arms. “That was when they told me that I had been shot.” The shotgun used in the attack had been loaded with several ball bearings. Some of these had hit the back of his head and neck, damaging his nerves and leaving him partially paralysed. He underwent many surgeries and therapy sessions — including physical and speech therapy — to regain his mobility and ability to speak. He was discharged from the hospital some time in January 2007, about two months after he was shot. He was caring for his little brother one night when the realisation of his situation fully hit him. “I thought the entire time that I was dreaming and that one day I would wake up. “Being there with (my brother) made me realise that maybe this wasn’t a nightmare, because every single day, it was the same story and I wasn’t going back to the way things were. I realised that... this is my life now.” When he eventually returned to high school later that year, things took a turn for the worst. “I started comparing myself to other people, and I realised nobody looked like me. I had a balance issue, and I was paralysed in my face. I was very different. \"I became very depressed. I started self-harming and I was even suicidal.” This marked the start of what would be a decade-long battle for Mr Almazan. It was when he studied sociology at the University of California that he decided to turn his life around. During his university years, Mr Almazan had the opportunity to spend a semester studying in Brazil — a chance he jumped at because he believed the new environment would do him good. Up till then, he had been very insecure throughout his schooling years because he feared that people would judge him based on the way he looked. He shied away from others and did not have many friends. “I thought if I went to a new country where everything was completely different and nobody knew anything about me, my life would change. “But I got to Brazil and I realised my life was the same.” The realisation that nothing had changed prompted Mr Almazan to ask himself if he wanted to continue living his life the same way — or if he would try to move forward with his life. He started making little changes to how he lived his life. One of his biggest fears was to talk to people, afraid that they would judge and reject him. Thus, a first step out of his comfort zone involved taking a risk to put himself out there and start talking to more people, Mr Almazan said. “Doing that and realising that nobody really cared about the way I looked gave me confidence to try more, and more, and more. “I started talking to more people, I started going out and I started doing things. “It wasn’t a shift overnight. It was just little things that I was doing over and over again, and I was slowly building my confidence.” After his time in Brazil, which he described as an “emotional experience”, Mr Almazan knew that he wanted to share about this and to help others as well. Rolling up his shirt sleeve during the sit-down interview, he revealed a tattoo on his left arm that reads: “The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.” Mr Almazan recalled how — when he was applying to university — he had chanced upon clips of motivational speaker Nick Vujicic sharing his story online. “I remember thinking that I was going to do that one day, that I wanted to be like him one day,” Mr Almazan said, though he did not act on it at the time. One day, after he had graduated from university, Mr Almazan was speaking with a friend when he began sharing his story in detail with her for the first time. She got visibly emotional and asked if he would consider becoming a motivational speaker. Mr Almazan began to seriously explore how he could do so, and eventually signed up for a mentorship programme that would guide him on his motivational speaking journey. Months after embarking on the programme, he had a memorable encounter. “I was talking to this woman in my community. I shared with her my story and then she started crying, (saying) ‘Oh my god, you saved my daughter’,” Mr Almazan said. The woman’s daughter was also battling depression at the time. On what he hopes others would also take away from his sharings, Mr Almazan said: “We can’t always control everything that happens in life — people go through things, and life happens. But these challenges don’t have to define who we are.” Referring to the Japanese practice of kintsugi — the act of repairing broken pottery by mending them with gold — from which he draws inspiration, Mr Almazan noted how people often try to replace broken things with something new. “But what kintsugi does is that it repairs that damage… and where it’s fractured, they cover it with gold, so it highlights the scars. “Kintsugi teaches us that our scars shouldn’t be something that we should be ashamed about. It’s something that we should be proud of, something that we should embrace, something to be celebrated.” He said that embracing this has helped him to realise that the challenges he faced were also what developed his character and made him who he is today. “(These challenges) gave my life a story. And because I have that story, my life is different, I am different, and I am more valuable because of that story.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — When full-time national serviceman Hamad Azam’s phone buzzed on a Sunday night with a message that read “JASPER” in all capital letters, the 21-year-old sprung out of his bed excitedly, grabbed his gear and dashed out of his home. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When full-time national serviceman Hamad Azam’s phone buzzed on a Sunday night with a message that read “JASPER” in all capital letters, the 21-year-old sprung out of his bed excitedly, grabbed his gear and dashed out of his home. An hour or so later, he found himself with several others on a trail in the forested area of Mandai in the wee hours of Jan 7, raring for action despite a lack of sleep. \"Jasper\" is not some National Service codeword flashing on a television screen, which signifies an ongoing mobilisation exercise for servicemen. Instead, it refers to the rare and elusive Jasper cat snake, which was spotted by a member of Mr Hamad’s “herping” chat group who alerted the rest of his sighting along a Mandai trail. This was the reason why Mr Hamad and four other members of the herping community were in Mandai: To catch a rare glimpse of the greyish-brown snake speckled with black and pink with their cameras. Herping refers to finding and observing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats. This often involves hiking, exploring and carefully observing different habitats to see these creatures to photograph them. Mr Hamad, who also goes by his Instagram handle \"Tobi\", said that it was a double delight because the group recently spotted another rare snake — a banded krait. “We were ecstatic mainly because the Jasper cat snake was an extremely unexpected, rare sighting, and this came seven days into the new year,\" the herping enthusiast said. Another avid shutterbug, Mr Terence Szeto, 32, said that interest in the wildlife photography hobby swelled during the Covid-19 pandemic when overseas travel was forbidden , though he said that their numbers probably declined after borders reopened. Still, that did not stop hundreds of passionate photographers and curious onlookers from gathering near a large tree in Telok Blangah in early May, after a pair of baby Sunda owls were seen nested there. The incident sparked ethical concerns about the role that these wildlife photographers play in an urban setting such as Singapore, with some people voicing their fears that such congregations risked affecting the young birds. Responding to these concerns, the wildlife photographers who spoke to TODAY urged their fellow shutterbugs not to take part in these large crowds around wild animals or stay for extended periods of time in order to avoid harming them. Mr Szeto said that he would rather avoid such crowds because of the added bonus of being able to enjoy the tranquillity that nature offers. He mainly photographs wildlife by himself or with his wife. Co-founder of Hatched Productions, a commercial video production company, he added: “The fun in the photography process is trying to find the animals by yourself, and I also prefer the quiet of nature.” Mr Hamad’s group believes in non-interference with nature as well. His posse of four photographers keep to official trails, since it is illegal to venture off marked paths. Anyone caught straying off designated trails in nature reserves can be fined up to S$2,000. Mr Hamad, who specialises in photographing snakes and has been doing so for nearly three years, said that rushing out to spot rare creatures is especially memorable when they are the only humans there. At the end of the day, their photography hobby serves a bigger purpose of spreading awareness about the wild ecosystem here and should never be just about the photos alone. “I started wildlife photography to share with Singaporeans that we have all these amazing animals,” the youth said. “I want to eliminate the misconception and the fear that snakes are out to get you... in reality, they are not.” Both Mr Hamad and Mr Szeto said that their interests in animals came from watching nature documentaries from an early age. Mr Szeto said: “I grew up watching nature documentaries, like National Geographic, BBC Earth and all that, and that got me interested in animals.” That allowed him to combine his love for animals with his field of study, which was filmmaking at university. At first, Mr Szeto was drawn to primates such as orangutans and other “ big, charismatic animals ” that could only be found overseas, including tigers in India and rhinos in Nepal. During the pandemic lockdown, when he could not travel to these locations, he started to focus on wildlife in Singapore. “I didn’t know that there were so many species locally. If you put the charismatic giant animals aside, you will find that Singapore has many very interesting species to offer.” Like other budding wildlife photographers, Mr Szeto was amazed at the biodiversity that a tiny island such as Singapore has to offer — from more than 400 species of birds to being home to rare animals such as the culogo (a small mammal resembling a flying squirrel with webbed feet that glides), the mouse deer and the pangolin . As for Mr Hamad, who also found himself drawn to animals through nature documentaries, it was the Instagram page of well-known nature photographer Jayaprakash Bojan here that made him take the plunge. “I got inspired, so I took my sister’s camera (an old Nikon digital SLR) and went to Pasir Ris Park for fun,” Mr Hamad said, adding that he was hooked after spotting his first snake, a mangrove pit viper, there. “I couldn’t believe it because, wow, a viper in urban Singapore.” Miss Zoee Lim, 22, an ecologist who first came up close with animals following a volunteering stint at the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) from 2017 to 2022, said that she got into the hobby after that. In addition to her work as a fauna specialist for biodiversity consultancy, Miss Lim does guided walks, wildlife photography and raise caterpillars. She photographs a variety of insects and reptiles, and said that these macro images of spiders, millipedes and butterflies help people see “beauty in the small stuff”. “I like to give a voice to the voiceless,” Miss Lim said, having been in the wildlife scene for seven years. “My goal is to capture the beauty of creatures that people would not even glance at and show that they, too, have their own intrinsic value.” Her motivation for photographing insects is in the hope that people can slow down to appreciate nature. “I want to sort of be the bridge between humans and wildlife to help humans appreciate and understand nature more,” she said. “Hopefully, this might inspire some people to want to protect them even more.” The photographers interviewed by TODAY said that most people do not realise how physically demanding wildlife photography can be, because it involves walking or hiking long distances, lying in wait for subjects to appear, and carrying heavy camera equipment. After all, when it comes to wildlife photography, shutterbugs may not always get their payoff since their subjects can come and go as they please. When Mr Hamad began taking photos of wildlife, he started with birds and found out that patience was a key aspect of the hobby. “There is a lot of walking and a lot of waiting. I think the longest I’ve waited for a bird to show was about four hours.” For snakes, the difficulty level ramps up more since these creatures are better at hiding from humans, Mr Hamad added. Outings can begin at 9pm and last until 5am. More often than not, these trips also end in vain. However, he said that insects are the hardest to photograph, given their size and closeness needed to shoot them, especially with a macro lens. For a higher chance of success with insects, doing some research about their habitat and having some in-field experiences will help. “(Photographing insects) is the hardest because even if you do get to spot a spider, then comes getting the proper angles of it, and they can scurry off anytime,” Mr Hamad said. Then, there is the constant frustration of not getting the shot, which can leave some young photographers disheartened. “I’d say that for most people, there will be other outings where you will go out and you will not get a single image at all, or a single usable image,” Mr Szeto said, adding that this may scare away budding photographers. “But I think it’s very rewarding when all the stars align.” For him, it took several months before he spotted the Raffles’ banded langur , which is a type of monkey with its distinctive black fur and white bands on its chest and inner legs. Mr Szeto said that since the langur prefers to be high up in trees, it can be challenging to get a good angle of them. “I think it took maybe a year to finally get that particular shot that I wanted.” Besides relying on chance and an individual's skills, wildlife photography can also be an exercise in teamwork, because it often depends on a community of like-minded spotters to track down rare creatures in the wild. Although the wildlife photography community here is generally friendly and welcoming to young photographers, with so many people vying for that one shot, some friction is bound to happen, those interviewed told TODAY. Mr Szeto said that he has seen squabbles among fellow shutterbugs who try to \"gate-keep\" certain locations where they found sightings of rare creatures, though such conflicts happen infrequently. Agreeing, Miss Lim said: “It has moments where it can get overly competitive. “If your luck happens to be better than others, (other photographers) will be very competitive in sharing locations (of animal sightings) with you.” Despite the challenges, Miss Lim said that the hobby is a rewarding one. She recalled how she managed to photograph a shore pit viper nicknamed “Blu” in Pasir Ris Park in June 2022. Blu was so named because shore pit vipers in Singapore are primarily purplish brown, but the one that she saw had a brilliant blue colouring on its head. To add to the allure, Blu is known to only make a public appearance once a year or every few years, making sightings of it extremely rare, she said. When a friend tipped Miss Lim off that Blu was found, she was in the middle of entering data from a field study. She dropped everything she was doing and went down to catch a glimpse of the snake as soon as she got the message. “The distance it was at was perfect. The shot was beautifully framed, and it wasn’t moving,” Miss Lim said of the photograph she took of Blu. The photographers admitted that the euphoria of getting the perfect shot can sometimes lead people into a frenzy. Mr Hamad said that he has witnessed photographers prioritising their photographs over the welfare of the wildlife. \"I can tell they are about getting the shot. They don’t really care about the welfare of the animal, or (are not there) to admire them.” In the end, ethics and the welfare of the animal can sometimes take second place. In the case of the Sunda owls, many nature groups voiced their concerns over the crowds gathered around the nest. The Singapore Bird Society said in a statement on its website: “Nesting birds are sensitive. When they sense that the site they selected is untenable, abandonment can happen.” On May 10, Acres said on Facebook that photographers and members of the public should minimise crowding in the area when the owlets were learning to fly. “This is a critical stage, and we sincerely appeal to photographers and the public to not surround the area. \"Presence of many people around fledged owlets can prevent the parents from giving the much-needed guidance,” the animal welfare organisation added. For Mr Hamad, he said that there were times when he was caught up in getting the shot and filling up his \"Pokedex\" with rare animals. A Pokedex — the term originating from the Pokemon game franchise — is used to describe a comprehensive collection or database of related items or knowledge. “I found myself no longer doing this as a hobby, and I was chasing after these birds. I found it quite unhealthy, so I took a break,” Mr Hamad added. An unhealthy obsession beyond the point of rationality can explain why some photographers end up crossing the line. Ultimately, they have to ensure that the welfare of the animal must be at the forefront of their hobby. “I definitely try to place the animal’s welfare above my own photography needs,” Mr Szeto said. Noting that some photographers would clap or make loud noises to get the animals to look at the camera, he said that such acts go against what nature photographers stand for in their work. \"While I (may not) have such a high chance of getting great images to take home, at least I won’t feel guilty, because I don’t do any of those (actions),” Mr Szeto added. Miss Lim agreed, saying: “Yes, you might desperately want the perfect shot, but what are you willing to give up in exchange for that? “The animal should come first. Your photographs should not be the priority.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — My family recently pointed out that even outside my official working hours, I spent a significant amount of time glued to my mobile phones or tablet, sometimes until late at night. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. SINGAPORE — My family recently pointed out that even outside my official working hours, I spent a significant amount of time glued to my mobile phones or tablet, sometimes until late at night. I demurred, saying that those little pockets of time are just moments for me to unwind from work before moving my focus to something else. Deep down, though, I was aware how the bad habit could affect my life, if it hasn’t already. First, it was taking a little time away from the family. Second, it was eating into time that I could otherwise use to do things I truly enjoy, or at least have proper rest . Incidentally, someone in the office mentioned a health fad called “dopamine fasting”, a way to detox and untether from our digital devices, among other things. Sure, she brought this up as a not-so-subtle way of asking me to try it out and write the next Gen Zen column. But hey, it sounds like a potential solution to my situation, so I gave it a whirl for about a week. For sure, this is not the only way to unplug. Some colleagues tried other ways, like going cold turkey for a longer period. More of that in the coming weeks. But for me, I’m just taking the small step by trying to conscientiously cut the time spent on my devices — and so far, I’ve gotten mixed results. Dopamine is known as a \"feel good\" hormone, so in today's age, digital scrolling is a type of activity that gives people pleasure. Some proponents believe that such activities may lead to reduced sensitivity to dopamine. Hence, dopamine fasting is simply the act of unplugging ourselves from our phones, in the hope that it can help the brain’s dopamine receptors “reset”. However, experts believe that this may be an oversimplistic or even erroneous take on dopamine. Dr Lim Boon Leng, private psychiatrist from Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, said: “It’s pertinent to note that the dopamine reward pathway is hypothetical and dopamine fasting is somewhat of a misnomer as it suggests our dopamine level can be directly manipulated by behavioural changes.” Dr Praveen Nair, senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, also said that there may be a misunderstanding of the purpose of dopamine. He added that the dopamine systems within the brain are “implicated in addictions”, but also in memories and behaviour reinforcement. “Do note that getting dopamine is not a bad thing. Someone else can get the same sensations from playing tennis, for instance, compared to playing video games. “The truth is that many of the suggestions of this trend are part of more established therapeutic modalities such as mindfulness. The overall package, though, appears to be a simplification of complex neural mechanisms, which can lead to misunderstanding and misuse.” For me, I feel that if I can do Ramadan fasting yearly, going 13 hours without food and drink, how hard could it be to just cut down on X (erstwhile Twitter) and the ‘gram, right? Wrong. I tried this “fast” for the first few days by simply filling up my schedule with leisure activities. This way, I thought I could cut down the free time on hand I can spend on my phone. On the first day (it was a Friday), I took more than an hour of slow walking at a park near my home before work. The second day was filled with errands-running and other activities, while on the third, I caught up on shows, went out and sang karaoke for three hours. (I almost lost my voice, but Celine Dion makes it worth it.) In that manner, I fully occupied myself from 8am to 8pm, or so I thought. And I felt good — physically and mentally — after doing these activities, so I really came out thinking that I’ve successfully fasted. To my surprise, when I opened the application activity tracker on my phone on the fourth day, I discovered that I have been spending roughly the same amount of time (if not more) on my social media apps as before. Upon a quick reflection, I realised that I might have, out of habit and without noticing, slid in pockets of time to glance at my social media apps throughout the day. At night, I pushed back my bedtime significantly to catch up on the social media scrolling I had missed in the day. So I took a more drastic measure, setting a time limit for my commonly used social media apps to half the amount of time I was spending on them. Over the next few days I did this, I felt that it did not help much. More than once, I tapped the \"add 10 more minutes to timer\" prompts when the time limit for the app ran out. But taking a step back, it’s better to have those pop-up reminders telling me I might not be doing as well as I thought in this fasting challenge, than to continue scrolling mindlessly for hours. Dr Nair said it was okay that I found this difficult, “because you are human”. Dr Lim outlined four possible reasons I found it tough to cut myself off from my devices, despite wanting to do so: Although using these devices more frequently than I’d like may be problematic, it does not necessarily mean that I’m addicted to social media, the experts assured me. “Addiction is often characterised by fixation on the addictive behaviour, compulsions to do so despite negative consequences, losing control over the behaviour and harmful use,” Dr Lim said. “Should these criteria be present, one should seek professional help.” However, barring an addiction, how problematic a certain level of behaviour (in this case, frequent usage of social media) is depends on the individuals, they emphasised. “For instance, being a reporter, it can be a safe assumption that being engaged with social media can have links to work (for instance, being closer to the latest news),” Dr Nair said. “As such, would such a behaviour really be maladaptive?” In the meantime, Dr Lim said that if I’m mindful that I indeed am having a problem, he suggested these practical steps to address them: Looking at the steps, it sounds like I’m on the right track. I just have to keep it up and bear in mind that breaking old habits — especially ones that make you feel good — is not going to happen overnight.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Otters dawdling in shopping malls, wild boars roaming around heartland shops and crocodiles turning up at popular beaches are becoming more common on this island nation. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Otters dawdling in shopping malls, wild boars roaming around heartland shops and crocodiles turning up at popular beaches are becoming more common on this island nation. As cities expand and natural habitats shrink, wild animals are venturing into human territories more frequently, increasing the need for effective management and co-existence strategies. These animals have captivated the public's attention with some people reacting favourably towards them, while others are less enthused — highlighting a complex challenge for the National Parks Board (NParks), which manages greenery, biodiversity conservation and animal welfare in Singapore. TODAY speaks to officers from NParks' Wildlife Management team, which was formed in 2019 and has around 30 staff members working to address public concerns while balancing the needs of wildlife creatures. Unlike her peers who became teachers or worked in other literary fields, English literature graduate Ms Kerine Leong found herself drawn towards a career that involved caring for animals. After graduating from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2021, Ms Leong joined NParks as a wildlife outreach officer. She felt like it was the \"natural pathway\" for her to go into after doing internships at the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) as an advocacy and education intern and as a part-time keeper at Mandai Zoo. Her current role at NParks involves managing public feedback on wildlife encounters, as well as doing outreach events to various communities on how to safely respond when one chances upon such creatures. While it may seem odd to some, Ms Leong said that her job perfectly blends her passion for animals with her academic background. \"I think it's a good mix between the arts and my love for animals. I feel like my English literature degree helps to convey technical information such as wildlife safety measures in a captivating and engaging manner to the public,\" she said. Apart from this, Ms Leong also works with grassroots leaders, other government agencies and animal welfare groups to mitigate wildlife-related conflict and come up with win-win policies on animal management. \"For example, for issues related to otters, we work with members of the Otter Working Group which comprises representatives from government agencies, academia and the community to monitor the otter population and develop holistic solutions for otter issues,\" she said. While raising awareness and working with other agencies form part of her job, the bulk of her time involves handling feedback from members of the public. Together with other NParks officers, Ms Leong handled about 9,700 cases of feedback in 2023, although not all reports involved human-wildlife conflict. That number is an increase from the 8,200 calls in 2021 and the 7,900 calls in 2022. The most common species of animals that individuals seek help for? Snakes and bats, said Ms Leong. \"It can get quite daunting... because the calls that we receive involve different types of wildlife, from snakes and bats to otters. So it was quite challenging because you never really know what and when the next case might come in,\" she said of manning the NParks duty hotline. Ms Leong said that officers are required to react quickly in a calm manner and think on their feet. She also emphasised the delicate balance required of officers who have to navigate human-wildlife conflicts while empathising with members of the public. \"In some cases when people call us to say they have a snake in their house, I have to respond calmly so they don't panic. \"I once had a case where an otter ate a (house owner's) koi fish. The callers got a little bit frustrated so I had to be more patient and understanding and keep in mind that these people had lost their pet koi.\" After an officer receives feedback, certified specialists from third party wildlife management companies are activated to attend to the situation. NParks officers may then personally follow up with the feedback provider on site, or through email or a call if they prefer, and explain to them how to stop future occurrences. Mr How Choon Beng, group director of wildlife management at NParks, said that when dealing with wildlife like pest birds, long-tailed macaques and crocodiles, among others, NParks considers an array of different factors. This includes the species’ habitat range, natural behaviour, threats to public safety, animal welfare, as well as the impact on native biodiversity, habitats and the community. Basing their assessment on these factors, he said that a range of measures may be adopted, including public education, habitat modification to reduce food sources and translation of animals away from urban areas, among other things. Teaching homeowners about these options as well as how to prevent wildlife from entering their premises is also a part of Ms Leong's job. For example, she tells homeowners that they can prevent otters from entering by fitting their main entrances with exclusion barriers or closing their windows and avoiding putting food near windows to stop macaques from entering. Some outreach programmes that Ms Leong has conducted include roadshows for residents moving into new public housing estates near nature areas and conducting programmes for children with the National Library Board. \"There was once when this preschooler came up to me after my talk and told me 'I really enjoyed your talk'. It felt quite nice for someone so young to appreciate my talks,\" she said. Ms Leong also said that some animals like snakes \"get quite a bad rep\" because of how they are portrayed in the movies or shows. \"That's where my team comes in to help educate the public that snakes are very shy (creatures) and they wouldn't really come and bother you if you leave them alone,\" she said. \"Sometimes feedback providers might be quite against them (the animals) in the beginning, but seeing them change their minds after explaining to them wildlife behaviour is quite a rewarding thing.\" As a child, Mr Tay Li Si spent a lot of time playing Pokemon games — which involves searching for different characters, including some elusive ones. The 27-year-old likens his current role as a researcher in NParks Wildlife Research Management to that of a Pokemon trainer. \"When I was younger, I played a lot of the Pokemon games. That was something that really inspired me because the animals and plants that we have around us are just like real-life Pokemons,\" said the Environmental Earth Systems Science graduate from NTU. His work involves conducting a variety of research projects, including field surveys like setting up cameras to monitor wildlife population dynamics. He also evaluates the effectiveness of human-wildlife conflict mitigation measures, such as crossing structures built to allow animals to traverse nature reserves safely. This includes a recently concluded study by NParks on wildlife crossings via culverts and roads at Old Upper Thomson Road. \"We have seen that they have been quite effective in facilitating the movement of animals and we do get quite a wide variety of animals using them including rare animals like the Sunda pangolin,\" he said, adding that the crossings reduce the likelihood of these animals ending up as roadkill. Since a significant portion of his job involves fieldwork two to four times a week, he has also encountered his fair share of surprises in the forest. \"Sometimes the weather may not be in our favour, sometimes we may take an unfamiliar path (and) a tree may fall. Or you may also come face-to-face with a wild boar or a snake may slither past you,\" he said. While these encounters sometimes startle him, he keeps in mind that these animals' first instinct is to run away and they do not mean any harm to humans. \"We are so much bigger than them, so they don't really want to approach us as well. As long as we are calm and collected they will move away on their own.\" Despite Singapore's land size, Mr Tay said that unknown to many, the nation is home to a wide variety of interesting wildlife and biodiversity, including the Malayan porcupine, spiny hill terrapin and giant forest ant. Part of his job is also to share as much information as possible about these animals to foster greater appreciation and understanding among the public. For example, the Asian Koel, known for its loud mating call — which Singaporeans have frequently complained about and termed as the \"uwu\" bird — also plays a special role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. \"The Asian Koel is known to be a brood parasite of the house crow. So in a way, they help to manage and reduce the population of crows in Singapore,\" said Mr Tay. A common question his team is frequently asked about is the population size of different species. Mr Tay said the question, while seemingly simple, is very difficult to answer and requires a lot of research strategies to collect data to model and estimate the population sizes. Despite the challenges of the job, Mr Tay said: \"Being able to go out and be immersed in nature is something that I wanted to do since I was young. And I'm happy to be able to do this right now.\" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article cited Ms Kerine Leong giving advice to homeowners on ways to prevent intrusions by meerkats, and that she had graduated in 2022. This is incorrect, as she was referring to macaques and she graduated in 2021. We are sorry for the errors.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — As I inch closer to my 25th birthday, I find myself becoming increasingly nostalgic for when I was 15. Back then, I was thick in the struggles of secondary school mathematics, but with the perks of seeing my friends every day and school holidays. The writer explores the challenges associated with moving from school to full-time employment. This audio is AI-generated. Adulthood is an invigorating stage of life as young people join the workforce, take on more responsibilities and set their sights on the future. But its many facets — from managing finances and buying a home to achieving work-life balance — can be overwhelming. In this series, TODAY’s journalists help young Singaporeans navigate this stage of their lives and learn something themselves in the process. SINGAPORE — As I inch closer to my 25th birthday, I find myself becoming increasingly nostalgic for when I was 15. Back then, I was thick in the struggles of secondary school mathematics, but with the perks of seeing my friends every day and being able to enjoy extended breaks in the form of school holidays. Financial decisions? Nothing more onerous than choosing what to buy for lunch at recess. Yet on the flip side of longing for my school days, as seen through rose-tinted glasses, is some wary wondering. Where did all that simple joy disappear to, and why? While this job at TODAY is not my first taste of full-time employment, my previous stint working in the education field abroad was reminiscent of residential college life. Back then, I was still immersed in the lively atmosphere of college activities and deadlines. Now, in my second year of full-time work since graduating in 2022, conversations with my friends in our rare catch-ups tend to inevitably revolve around what occupies most of our days: Work. And while there are perks, such as greater financial independence, so many of those around me are often tired and stressed. This could be from projects, anxiety about office dynamics, financial planning or an existential uncertainty about where all this is leading to. An NTUC Youth Taskforce identified the top three challenges faced by most young adults when transitioning from school to the workplace: “In both the workplace and school, there are opportunities to meet diverse people and build social and professional networks, which are important for personal and career growth,\" said Ms Natasha Choy, the executive secretary of Young NTUC. \"However, school often provides a safety net, whereas the professional workplace can be an unfamiliar environment with new tasks.” In the spirit of my full-time role, I spoke with career experts and a counsellor to find out more on why the jump from school to work feels like such a leap for young adults, and how to better cope. Ms Shannon Toh, a career coach from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) career and attachment office, said young adults tend to hold onto the “student mindset” when first beginning work, such as approaching a task like submitting an assignment without thinking a few steps ahead or taking ownership of the given task. Unlike the teacher-student dynamic, fast-paced work environments may also leave little time for seniors to train new hires, leading them to face challenges in completing tasks and being criticised for poor quality work, she added. “Many who did not go through internships may find it challenging to apply theoretical knowledge to the real-world task given, which may cause them to feel demoralised.” Agreeing, Ms Amanda Tay, a counsellor at Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre (EMCC), said that while goals are pre-defined for students, there is no “one straight path to success” in a career, which can create a sense of loss. She said the academic environment is akin to riding a bike with training wheels, and the \"huge\" transitional challenges of full-time work are like having those training wheels removed. More than learning how to apply familiar content to real-world assignments, young adults also have to traverse the social minefield of interacting within a workplace hierarchy. “Even the most veteran colleague faces this challenge; learning to understand the complexity of office politics and work culture, and navigating through these winding roads may become a stressful situation for a lot of young adults,” said Ms Toh. In a conversation with a close friend from my school days, she called the transition to full time work after graduating university “free falling”, a metaphor experts said was apt, as work can feel endless in a less structured environment. Tasks are no longer apportioned into timetables but can come in the form of juggling multiple projects and abstract benchmarks like promotions or appraisals. The stakes of working life as compared to the academic world are also higher, as young adults begin to take on financial commitments such as insurance premiums, working towards a house and even caregiving responsibilities. The daunting ambiguity at the start of one's career stems from many youths still trying to identify their interests and strengths or come up with long-term goals, said Ms Eve Puan, a career specialist from NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). She added that many young adults commonly struggle to land their first job with limited work experience and may have had to deal with a stressful and repetitive job search process, which can affect young adults' confidence and self-esteem. Ms Toh from NTU said that project and task objectives at work, too, can be “ambiguous” during the initial planning stages, leaving young employees unsure of where or how to start. “In a workplace, while one is expected to ensure that the deliverables are met when a task is given, they are also expected to think ahead or strategise, and be prepared to make changes along the way,” she said. Employees also have to get used to last-minute changes, as projects can be scrapped before implementation or have to be reworked entirely, she added. “Young adults are still trying to find themselves, and it is common and normal to feel lost at some point, especially when the challenges are out of your control,” said Ms Tay from EMCC. Unlike the predictable routine of working independently or with similar age group peers for school assignments, working with different groups of people can be foreign and daunting. “Moreover, it is useful to manage your expectations that sometimes we must go through the mundanity of tasks, especially as a junior staff, before we connect the dots and grow stronger from it,” said Ms Tay. Perhaps the most simple and crucial of all the ways work differs from schooling life is the isolation and inevitable distance that comes as young adults’ lives diverge into different careers. Coordinating hangouts at university was easy as my friends planned out their timetables to have rest days. But working across industries with different busy seasons and leave allowances has made rainchecks frequent and forgivable. Unlike the comfort and security of people who have seen me grow up, meeting people in the workplace can come with a side of “imposter syndrome”. Ms Tay calls this “the fear of not being able to live up to the company's, their families, or their own standards”. She said that having social plans with family and friends could help to keep young adults “grounded” as they navigate work-life boundaries. “Akin to being in education, time and resources are needed to be intentionally carved out, to strengthen and foster relationships and social lives outside of work,” said Ms Tay. That doesn’t mean you can’t be social at work, either, she added, as joining social activities at the workplace and social clubs or interest groups outside of work could help foster social connections in and outside of work. Even when conversations do tread towards day-to-day work life in social gatherings among friends, I often end up feeling much better overall after a catch-up or impromptu weekday dinner. This manifests in the office, too, where lunch conversations about the projects we’re each working on, or even non-work topics can lead to meaningful insights for a story, or life-related gems such as tips on meditation and crochet. Experts said that finding a way to stay connected with those we cherish and making meaningful bonds in the workplace are key strategies to cope. Ms Roberta Balagopal, a senior consultant at career counselling firm Gary and Pearl International, said that having fun often “falls by the wayside” in young adults’ transition to work. “We need daily doses of happiness to live, without this balance we can fall into burnout, and we've seen this happen at increasingly young ages, like (those in their) early 20s,” said Ms Balagopal. “Make time for hobbies and relationships, and make sure there is something fun to do daily, not save up for the weekend or a once-a-year holiday. It can be something small and simple; just do it daily.” Experts also suggested finding a mentor at work to speak to, as they can also share their experience and encouragement when work starts to look dreary. Restoring an independent sense of structure and forming a new routine, especially since workplace deadlines may be self-directed, is also important. Experts suggested making checklists, prioritising urgent to non-important and non-urgent work tasks, and building one’s own timeline, especially when handling multiple responsibilities simultaneously. Ms Balagopal added that cultivating skills in time management, to learn to prioritise one’s efforts and energy, is crucial to minimise stress. And learning how to say “no” is a key skill. A way of finding one’s own rhythm is giving oneself “protected time” at work, said Ms Toh from NTU, who recalled an alumnus who set aside lunch time to recharge herself. Like my commiserating chats with peers, it was affirming to hear experts' assertions that I’m not alone in the “free-fall”, nor is it a new challenge as generations of students before me similarly took the leap into the workforce. Immersion in the workplace after almost two decades of school life is daunting, but Ms Tay suggested viewing the challenges as opportunities to learn more about oneself, such as reflecting on whether their definition of success is in line with the company's. Ms Puan from NTUC's e2i also suggested adopting a mindset open to learning to be put in good stead as one's career progresses, and working with a career coach to help one identify their skills gaps and plan out next steps. \"If you have been enjoying most of your work and company culture, it is likely that you’ve found the right fit,\" said Ms Puan. \"If the job aligns with your skills, values and long term goals, it will be easier to thrive and grow in the workplace.\" It is almost as if I’m “back to school” but on a whole new level of self-discovery, learning more about my values as I try to find my own healthy mix of work, life, and everything in between.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — When Ms Lam Bao Yan flew to a refugee camp in eastern Germany in April 2022 to offer support to Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion of their country, she could hardly have imagined what lay ahead. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When Ms Lam Bao Yan flew to a refugee camp in eastern Germany in April 2022 to offer volunteer support to Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country, she could hardly have imagined what lay ahead. Since then, Ms Lam, 40, along with her husband Rudy Taslim, also 40, have shuttled between Ukraine and Singapore around 10 times. The couple were also granted residential status in Ukraine after being invited to do so. In that initial solo visit, Ms Lam lived at the refugee camp in Bad Blankenberg, Germany for a month, where she cooked for, counselled and cared for Ukrainian refugees. “When the month was up, we were supposed to come back to Singapore, but I just felt like I could do more,” Ms Lam told TODAY. “If these refugees were already so in need, I was wondering where is the need the most? I can only imagine it would be in Ukraine.” This prompted her to enter Ukraine itself to continue serving its citizens and residents on the frontlines of the war. Her husband joined her in June 2022. The couple are the founders of architecture firm Genesis Architects in Singapore, whose projects have included a resort in the Maldives, a residential development in Australia and various projects in Singapore. The success of the business helps to fund their humanitarian work in Ukraine, as well as other good works around the world, including helping vulnerable children in the Amazon basin in Brazil. In Ukraine, they have built more than 500 emergency houses for vulnerable members of the community, including the elderly, the young and the physically disabled. The homes are in various parts of the country, including villages near the cities of Lyman, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, which are all in the country's east. Other emergency homes have been built in villages such as Moschun, outside the capital Kyiv. The projects also provide employment to Ukrainian locals, whom they hire to help build these houses. The couple are co-founders of humanitarian organisation Love on Ukraine. Besides building homes for vulnerable Ukrainians, they also bring in generators from the Netherlands, and provide free electricity and internet access to individuals and organisations such as hospitals and orphanages. This allows those in need to charge their mobile and medical devices, communicate with family members outside of Ukraine, and obtain information online on getting food and medical aid, if needed. To date, they have planted more than 80 “lighthouses” – the name they give to these areas of refuge – in several locations across Ukraine. Through Love on Ukraine, the couple also extend financial and social support to pregnant women who have lost their husbands to the war, and individuals with special needs or disabilities who are unable to leave the country. The couple, who shuttle between Singapore and Ukraine every 10 weeks or so, were awarded Ukrainian residential status by the government in 2022. Mr Taslim told TODAY that the Ukraine government recognised their commitment to rebuilding the country, and the couple were invited to apply for residential status. They were granted residency, which allowed them to continue their works in Ukraine. They will next return to Ukraine on June 13, where they will focus on setting up rehabilitation hospitals for wounded casualties, and train chaplains and community leaders involved in trauma counselling. They will also convert more vehicles in order to make them suitable for transporting casualties, and expand existing orphanages’ capacities. Before each trip back to Ukraine, the couple prepare themselves by spending time with their families. They also wean themselves off coffee, sugar and chocolate, and cut down their daily intake by one meal to ensure they can keep functioning even without easy access to food. The pair also obtain medication to regulate heart palpitations, which they experience at times while serving on the frontlines of the war zone. Ms Lam and Mr Taslim are no strangers to such work – with Love on Ukraine being just the latest in a string of humanitarian projects they are involved in. In 2013, the couple, who are Christians, attended Iris Harvest School, an evangelistic missions training school, in Mozambique. Ms Lam said: “Twelve years ago, after building many big malls and buildings and infrastructure, we asked ourselves: Could there be more to architecture than all these big buildings?” They decided to buy a one-way ticket to Mozambique to be trained as missionaries. It was also on that trip that the couple learnt how their specific skill sets could play a part in designing and building a local university, to create educational opportunities for the next generation, said Mr Taslim. Armed with a heart for mission work and equipped with vocational skills in architecture and entrepreneurial work, the pair sought to use their skill sets to practically meet different communities’ needs. For example, Mr Taslim’s architectural training has helped him to quickly identify basic amenities to be built into the emergency homes in Ukraine, to ensure they are “fit for purpose” and able to “withstand for a good number of years”. “Even after the war ends, people will still need to pick up their lives, to save money, before they can start building their homes again. “These houses are permanent and can last them till then. And even if they were to build a house after that, they can consider our homes as an extension of their final home.” Besides building insulated and shock-resistant homes for displaced Ukrainians, the couple have also taken on several other pro bono architectural projects around the world. These include building a university in Mozambique, a school for blind children in Rwanda, and an air strip in the jungles of Borneo to help evacuate members of the indigenous Dayak tribe who face medical emergencies. Most recently, the couple are working towards building a school in the Amazon basin in Brazil to bring education to children in the community who have been rescued from trafficking and exploitation. It took the pair 44 hours on four different plane rides to reach the community nestled in the Amazon rainforest. Ms Lam said: “(We want to) overcome injustice with good, and good looks differently to different people. ‘Good’ could look like a word of encouragement to some, (but to us) ‘good’ looks like our skill sets. “We are not politicians, neither are we militarians, so we cannot overcome injustice with these because we are not influential people like that. But we overcome all this injustice with the good that we know – our skill sets and our lives.” On how they fund these volunteer projects, Mr Taslim and Ms Lam said their work is largely self-funded through Genesis Architects. Mr Taslim said that their practice is “commercially sustainable”, which allows the couple to then redirect part of their profits into their pro bono projects. But to do so and ensure the business stays up and running, the pair continues to work remotely on their humanitarian trips – even if this means they have to log on or off in the wee hours of the day, amid the time zone differences. Along the way, the couple have also received donations from family and friends who offer to support the couple’s work in their own ways. “I think, in some ways, we kind of model it for them… like ‘I can’t go there, but I can help to maybe pay for 10 doors, or I can pay for 200 pairs of shoes for the children going to school’. And then they sort of started helping out very organically,” said Mr Taslim. Ms Lam added: “And it’s not just money, though money is important. Some of (our family and friends) give us very good professional advice… like teachers, counsellors, medical doctors, nutritionists. So these are very precious resources… and all this professional knowledge is very helpful for us.” Ultimately, their business is just a means to an end, and a way to ensure the pair can sustain their pro bono work. While building commercial architecture like shopping malls and hotels is great, Ms Lam said they hope to also construct buildings – such as schools and hospitals – which will create lasting impact on the generations to come. “We want to make an impact with our architectural practice for the human good, and not just for enjoyment.” And while Mr Taslim said it is difficult to project what an “end goal” to their volunteer work would be, his hope is that the work they do would “demonstrate the power of one” and help others to recognise the difference even one person can make. “If we were all individually to really look at where we are, the potential circles of impact that we have, and plant the seed of impact right there and then – I think the world really can become a better and nicer place to live in.” Agreeing, Ms Lam said that everyone has different skill sets, backgrounds, connections and networks. What’s crucial is to be willing to “start small” and to serve in the ways one is able to. This could look like what some primary school children in Singapore did, when they wrote cards and drew pictures for the couple to distribute at a children’s hospital in Ukraine. Others, like a community of elderly women in Singapore, knitted several scarves in different sizes and materials for the couple to give out on their trip, said Mr Taslim. “We gave (these scarves) to them, and everyone was crying. They feel like ‘wow, I have never seen these grandmothers and I will never be able to see them’, but it touched their hearts. “I felt like these women are amazing. They really caught the spirit of just believing that they can make a change. “And you don’t have to go to Ukraine or Amazon to do this, but there are absolutely avenues even within Singapore for you to make a difference.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — When 34-year-old renovation contractor M D Hossain picked up rollerblading in Singapore two months ago, he was excited about the prospect of trying a new sport that he could not experience back home in Bangladesh. Mr Hossain said his home village does not have paved roads, which would make skating there “very difficult and dangerous”. Though he has worked here for almost 15 years, he started rollerblading only in April this year, after a friend introduced him to a skating interest group for migrant workers. Before this, Mr Hossain said he usually spent his free time on Sundays just relaxing, or going around Singapore to visit places of interest. But such is his love for his new pastime that he prefers to spend his free time skating these days. On what drew him to the sport, Mr Hossain said: “It’s very good, but learning is hard. Everybody has a sport they like – some want cricket, some want football. I like this one, my choice.” Mr Hossain is a member of a skating interest group made up of more than 200 migrant workers from four countries: The Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh and India. The group – the Skate Club Singapore – was founded by six friends from the Philippines in September 2022. It has since ballooned in membership through social media postings and word of mouth. Ms Ella Lyn, 35, one of the six friends who founded the interest group, told TODAY that she was very surprised when the group started getting bigger. She did not expect people to join them as they were not professionals in the sport, but she believes that prospective members probably saw the “energy, fun, good vibes and pictures of places we have been to ride”. Ms Lyn, a domestic helper, said that the original group of six had started skating during the Covid-19 pandemic, as they were limited by the type of activities they could do outdoors together. They all grew to love the hobby. \"Skating helps us because it keeps us stress-free for the whole week,” she said. “I started with nothing, I didn’t know this type of sport. But we just tried it, and we like it. “We’re not professionals. Most of us just like the pictures we take while skating and the adventures in the park. We just enjoy it – the views, the parks – we can go around Singapore and we enjoy it.” Ms Lyn said the group welcomes anyone who wishes to join. The only prerequisite is that members buy their own rollerblades and safety gear such as knee and elbow pads. The club’s members take turns to guide and teach newcomers on the basics of rollerblading. Today, Ms Lyn is an administrator of the skate club. The group meets between 9am and 9pm every Sunday, at gate seven of the National Stadium’s 100Plus Promenade. A member of the group would usually cook and prepare food each week, which they share in the morning before setting off to skate, said Ms Lyn. They aim to attempt different routes each week, which could include skating from the stadium to East Coast Park, Marina Barrage or Marina Bay Sands. When TODAY met the group on June 2, they had just returned from skating at the Jurassic Mile along the Changi Airport Connector. Sporting a yellow and black custom-printed T-shirt designed by a club member, Ms Lyn said: “Actually we were just thinking, if we rode in one place or in one park and we were wearing different outfits with different colours, it’s not that nice. “So we thought it's better we have a uniform. So each place we go, we have nice pictures because we’re all wearing the same T-shirts.” The bright yellow shirts also serve as an avenue for recruiting new members. Ms Lyn said: “A lot of people see us and they go, ‘Oh! This is a skate club?’ when they read our uniforms. “When we go skating, people will approach us on how to join our team. So we just tell them to come to the stadium, buy your own gear and skates, and we will guide you.” To date, the club has had three iterations of their T-shirt. These include a long-sleeved version, to offer sun protection during long rides under the sun. The third and latest T-shirt design is an “international version of our uniform”, said Ms Mercy Dumlao, who designed the shirts. She is also part of the original group of six friends who founded the skate club. This version features the national flags of the four countries the club’s members hail from. The group also started a Facebook group to collate and share pictures of the views from their skate routes around Singapore. “Our old pictures and memories will stay there (online),” said Ms Lyn. “Because we are not citizens of Singapore, when we go home, at least we have memories of rollerblading here in Singapore.” It is also through the group’s Facebook page and other social media platforms such as TikTok that members Mr Mithu Arifurzaman and Ms Reynalyn Cidro came to join the club. Mr Arifurzaman, 36, a construction site supervisor from Bangladesh, joined the group in November 2022 after seeing their Facebook page. He remembered thinking that rollerblading looked fun, after watching some videos of the group. He did not know how to skate and only picked up the sport through the club. Today, Mr Arifurzaman also serves as an administrator of the skate club’s WhatsApp group for male members. As administrator, he helps to plan the club’s weekly routes, broadcasts announcements to other members in the WhatsApp group, and documents pictures and videos of their rides to be uploaded onto the club’s Facebook page. For Mr Arifurzaman, who works long hours from Mondays to Saturdays – sometimes stretching from 5.30am to 10pm – being able to spend his rest days rollerblading breaks the monotony of work and brings him happiness. “Coming here, I have more friends, more brothers and sisters… and I also enjoy (myself) more here,” he said. Agreeing, Ms Cidro said: “I joined the skate club because I want to enjoy my day off, and to meet others from other countries and be friends.” The 31-year-old domestic helper from the Philippines joined the group in October last year. She had reached out to club members after seeing videos of the club on TikTok. Ms Cidro picked up the sport in a day, and now also helps to coach newer members of the club. She said that Sunday’s skate trip from the National Stadium to Changi Jurassic Mile is her favourite route to date, and that she generally feels much happier being able to spend her free time rollerblading. Besides building new friendships and finding a community of their own away from home, Ms Joan Soria Villanueva, 38, said the weekly exercise makes her body feel good. While she was initially apprehensive as she did not know how to skate, she was thankful she could pick up the sport slowly and at her own pace through the club. Today, the domestic helper said she also joins her employer on rides to Marina Bay in their free time. Asked about her hopes for the club as it approaches its two-year anniversary in September, Ms Lyn said: “I hope for more people to join us and experience the good vibes – to share more ideas and opinions with each other. She added: “Being far away from our family is not easy, so we plan more excitement and help each other to be fit mentally. “As I always remind them, we are not (of the) same culture and character, but we can be the same by showing respect and being kind, so each and every one has the memories to remember when we go back home.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — Every week, Ms Summer Chen will take her one-and-a-half-year-old son to a special spot in Punggol Regional Library, where there is a children's wonderland for her son can spend hours tinkering around with various toys and play together with other kids. Ms Summer Chen (right) with her husband and son at the Toy Library, a dedicated section for children aged six and under at Punggol Regional Library, on May 27, 2024. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — Every week, Ms Summer Chen takes her one-and-a-half-year-old son to a special spot in Punggol Regional Library, where there is a children's wonderland for him to spend hours tinkering around with various toys and playing with other kids. Located in a corner of the library's ground floor, the Toy Library features some 70 educational toys that are meant for kids aged six and under to play with free-of-charge. He usually gravitates to puzzles or sensory toys, such as an orange-coloured toy board with locks and latches. Now and then, he summons the courage to interact with other kids — and the toys help to break the ice. \"Since coming here, he has learned to be more social and tries to interact with others,\" said Ms Chen, 31, who declined to give her son's name. \"(This is) unlike when he is at an outdoor playground, where he would keep to himself.\" The valuable social lessons that the place has given to her son is why Ms Chen and her husband are all too willing to commute for an hour each week from their home in Tampines to Punggol by public transport. Found within the five-storey Punggol Regional Library, which is located at lifestyle hub One Punggol, the Toy Library was opened on Jan 30 last year by the National Library Board (NLB) as part of Singapore's first public library to offer a range of services for persons with disabilities. Since its launch, Punggol Regional Library has welcomed more than 1.3 million visitors, making it the most visited library in 2023. The Punggol estate also has one of the highest proportions of children below five years old in its resident population, according to NLB's website. When TODAY visited last month at around 2.30pm on a weekday, there were five families visiting the brightly lit space, which consists of tables for children to play their selected toys as well as small booths for their parents or caregivers to watch over the kids . However, the toys cannot be loaned out and are only available for play and learning onsite at the library. The Toy Library is also managed partly by beneficiaries from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds) who help to sanitise the toys and maintain the cleanliness and tidiness of the space. Minds is a social service agency serving persons with intellectual disability, caregivers and their families. Ms Kavita Ilangovan, senior manager at Punggol Regional Library, said: \"We want to help young children aged six and below to learn through play as toys are an essential part of play, which comprises creative, dramatic and sensory elements.\" NLB is also continuing to explore opportunities to expand its offerings across the library network, collaborating with \"like-minded partners\" to maintain and extend the educational benefits of learning through play to more children, she added. Apart from regular toys, the Toy Library also features educational aids, puppets, costumes as well as toys with sensory enhancements. Each cater to different types of play, which can be grouped into four categories. The first is to spur creative play, which aids a child's motor skills, hand-eye coordination and stimulates brain development. A second approach is dramatic play, which encourages the child to use his or her imagination to recreate scenes from stories. Next, some toys encourage sensory play, which develops a child's fine and gross motor skills, and cognitive growth. Finally, the library also features tinkering aids, which offer children the ability to experiment and find creative solutions to basic design and engineering challenges with their parents and caregivers. These toys are selected based on their educational value, developmental benefits, inclusivity and safety in order to cater to a diverse range of interests and abilities, said Ms Ilangovan. According to Ms Ilangovan, the Toy Library has around 70 educational toys, which include 10 costumes, five sets of puppets, seven sets of tinkering toys, and 48 sensory and creative play toys. They are also changed regularly to provide variety. Speaking to TODAY, Ms Chen, an engineer by profession, said she first heard about the Toy Library through a friend who showed her a photo of the location. The idea piqued her interest when she saw that it was an air-conditioned space with a variety of toys available at no cost. \"Looking for a similar indoor space is a big difficulty as most of them require a fee, so if we can find a free one in the library, it's great (for us),\" she said. Other parents also lauded the free initiative, adding that its presence helped impart important educational values to their young children. Ms Suhaila, 35, who declined to give her full name, said it was only her third time at the Toy Library, but she found that the space had offered her a good and interactive way for her youngest daughter to be engaged with literature, as she did not have a long attention span for reading. She said her older children have become more independent and curious as a result of visiting the library, and she wanted the same for her youngest child. \"(With the Toy Library), my youngest especially, who is six, would venture around the space on her own and be interested to find out more about how different toys work,\" she said. Another parent who frequents the library, Ms Juliana Rasid, 40, agreed that the Toy Library is a great way to introduce her one-year-old son and five-year-old daughter to the library environment of books and reading. \"It is a pre-activity before we move onto books as my children love to play with toys... But there is also a social element to it as they get to interact and play with other children while learning patience,\" she said. Ms Juliana said that her family does not have the habit of buying toys for the children as they might not always be a hit with her children. With the variety of toys available at the Toy Library, however, she is able to observe what interests them most. Considering that the toys at the Toy Library are free for all to use, parents said the library also helps to teach the kids about sharing a public good and caring for these toys as if they were their own. Mr Andrew Tan, 42, a stay-at-home dad who visits the place twice weekly, said he began seeing a positive change in two daughters' behaviour when it came to sharing toys. Watching his eight-year-old daughter pull out a princess outfit from a rack of costumes at the Toy Library to dress her four-year-old sister, Mr Tan said with a smile: \"They love to share now, because now they know that there are other children who would want to play with the toys and they learn how to give the toys to the younger children.\" On top of that, they have also come to appreciate that toys are valuable as they cost money to buy, and thus toys that are shared among many children at the library deserve to be treated with care. Said Mr Tan: \"They learned that they don't have to buy toys (for themselves), because there are places where they can share toys (instead).\" He also hopes for the concept to be implemented in more libraries in the future so as to benefit more children by teaching them values and instilling some discipline at a young age. Though she hopes to see more music-related offerings at the Toy Library, Ms Stephanie Chang, 36, has found the Toy Library to be a great space to explore with her 22-month-old son. \"We are from the UK where libraries host free playgroups for children with toys to play with, but since being in Singapore, we have not found anything like that which is free,\" said Ms Chang. Since visiting the Toy Library, she has noticed that the space provided a great way to reduce wastage of toys and her son is able to try out different toys at different developmental stages without having to clutter the home. \"He certainly loves the space and I find that we can stay longer in the library as we alternate between the books section and the Toy Library,\" said Ms Chang. In order to keep the Toys Library in good shape for visitors, students from Minds Fernvale Gardens School also take on work attachment opportunities at NLB to help maintain the library. The school is dedicated to persons with disabilities, aged seven to 18, to stay engage through programmes and learning experiences to develop critical skills while nurturing their interests and talents. The idea was first conceived back in March 2020 to make Punggol Regional Library accessible to persons with disabilities. Currently, four students undergo the work exposure programme, which takes place weekly between the school's second and fourth terms, every year. During school holidays, NLB would take over the maintenance of the Toy Library. Said the school's vice-principal Evelyn Soh: \"Through this work attachment at Punggol Regional Library, we hope that our students can learn and gain work readiness skills as well as soft skills like time-management to complete assigned tasks independently. \"We also hope that they will pick up independent living skills such as travelling home from the library and finding solutions to the obstacles that they encounter at work.\" Besides sanitising the toys and maintaining the general cleanliness and tidiness of the toy library, the Minds students also attend to visitors' queries and are trained to approach the library staff for assistance when they are unable to answer the queries. Since the work attachment began, Ms Soh said that she has observed positive changes in her students as they become more independent in managing themselves, including reporting to work on time. The students also learned to show care and concern to their peers, look out for one another and offer help when needed. \"Through this collaboration, we hope that the community can better appreciate that persons with intellectual disabilities have the propensity to learn, and with the right support and opportunity, they too can be valued contributors to society,\" said Ms Soh.

    "article_content": "Features SINGAPORE — After years of watching his older siblings make a name for themselves, Adrian Lee, the younger brother of mixed martial arts (MMA) stars Angela, Christian and the late Victoria, is set to continue his family’s legacy in the ring. This audio is AI-generated. SINGAPORE — After years of watching his older siblings make a name for themselves, Adrian Lee, the younger brother of mixed martial arts (MMA) stars Angela, Christian and the late Victoria, is set to continue his family’s legacy in the ring. It is not surprising since he hails from a family of MMA fighters, all of whom are highly respected in the community. Adrian's oldest sister, Angela , was the youngest MMA world champion in history when she won the One Championship women's atomweight world title at the age of 19 in May 2016. As for Victoria, she was dubbed a prodigy, who held a 3-0 record before taking her own life on Boxing Day in December 2022. She was 18. Victoria's death was the turning point of Angela's career, as the older sister, now 27, retired last September to focus on mental health advocacy. Both sisters had fought at One Championship events alongside their brother Christian, also a world champion, representing Singapore and the United States. And now Adrian, 18, is ready. Having trained under Christian, 25, he is the first Lee sibling to fight in the ring again after Victoria’s demise. Adrian made his debut at the One Championship in Bangkok, Thailand, on June 8, defeating fellow newcomer Antonio Mammarella via a rear naked choke. “I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life. I’m so happy I got my turn,” Adrian said to commentator Mitch Chilson after the fight. Watching his grit and determination in the octagon, it was hard to imagine that this was the same boy I had spoken to in a virtual interview just a few days before. On camera, he was slightly sheepish, doing his best to tell his story. I was anxious, too. With tough questions to ask, I didn’t know how he would react, especially those related to his sisters. Yet, Adrian remained cool and positive, smiling as he described what it was like to follow in his siblings' footsteps. \"It's been amazing. I'm so blessed and lucky to be born into a family full of accomplished athletes. I've seen step-by-step what it takes to get to the top, and I'm excited to start my journey.\" He acknowledged feeling the pressure of being the youngest fighter in the family, but much of this is due to his own high standards and expectations. “One expectation I have is that I’ll always finish all my fights, either by knockouts, TKOs (technical knockouts), or submissions. I don’t plan to leave the decision to the judges,” he said confidently. “And so far, I’ve had great success doing that.” Before his One Championship debut, Adrian's credentials were already impressive. He was a four-time national youth MMA champion and he had also won the Pankration World title at a wrestling event in Hawaii. It is dizzying just looking at all that Adrian has accomplished at his tender age — he first started training at the age of three and was competing in competitions at four. However, I had to ask him about how he dealt with loss, especially one that shook not only his family, but also the world. My heart pounded as I brought up Victoria, who was undefeated in her career. She made her debut at 16 at a One Championship event at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in 2021 and dominated all three fights that year. She was so young when she lost her life, the same age Adrian is now. I wanted to know how he coped with the tragedy almost two years ago, and what helped him stay focused and motivated in his own journey. Adrian’s replies were brief and polished: “I stay motivated and focused by staying in the gym. As long as I’m training, there are no other thoughts.” He continued: “My sister Victoria has inspired me in all (aspects) of life, and she’ll continue to walk by my side throughout my journey.” I could sense Adrian was putting up a brave front, but just a tinge of hesitance gave it away. I quickly apologised to him if my questions made him uncomfortable, but he was cordial about it and told me that it was okay. Then, when I asked for more personal anecdotes on how Victoria had inspired him, he said: “I’m sorry. Can we skip it?” I readily obliged. His response was not entirely unexpected, considering the profound impact of Victoria’s death on the family. The Lee family later closed their United MMA gym in Hawaii. It was a decision made by their father, Mr Ken Lee, a Singaporean martial artist who holds black belts in Brazilian jiu-jitsu , pankration and taekwondo. In September 2023, Angela revealed in an online article for The Players' Tribune website that she herself had attempted suicide in 2017, a period marked by immense pressure and expectations as well as personal challenges . The website features athletes writing stories or letters in first-person and Angela's article was titled Resilient. She wrote then that she got to a point where she had pushed her mind and body too far, and her car crash in November 2017 was not an accident. Highlighting the often-hidden struggles faced by some individuals, even those who appear strong and successful, Angela encouraged people to seek help and not to suffer in silence, stressing that mental illness can affect anyone. After retiring, Angela established Fightstory, a non-profit mental health charity, in Victoria’s honour, advocating for mental wellness in the global fight community. Adrian said that Angela is no longer involved in MMA. “I think it's great that my sister has started a new path with Fightstory and wants to encourage others to open up about mental health.” The family's gym has also reopened as Prodigy Training Centre, where Adrian trains for his fights. In the last eight months, his preparation work intensified from his usual training to set the stage for his debut. He had three training sessions almost every day, each session lasting about two to three hours. Adrian said that he maintains his mental wellness by staying focused in the gym. “I put all my focus into MMA because I love it. It’s familiar to me, and it’s my lifestyle.” He feels fortunate to have made his debut under the guidance of his brother Christian, who keeps him disciplined and on track. Christian now holds both the One lightweight and welterweight world titles, and was the youngest male world champion in One Championship history, achieving this milestone at 20. Adrian said: “One piece of advice he's given me that I’ll always remember is to stay focused on the game plan because there are going to be a lot of things that come with MMA, such as media and photoshoots. “I just have to remember what I came here to do, and that’s to fight.” So, what’s next for Adrian? He told me that after beating Mammarella, he aspires to become a lightweight and welterweight champion, just like his brother. Adrian’s parents are throwing their support behind their youngest, too, constantly checking in on him to ensure that he is mentally and physically sound. “They support me by buying healthy groceries, which helps keep my weight in check. Sticking to a healthy diet may be difficult at the start, but it’s now very easy for me to stay disciplined.” To get a better idea of what an 18-year-old aspiring world champion’s diet looks like, here’s what Adrian has been eating since he was 15: Various sources of protein, vegetables and grains, and nothing fried and processed. Still, he enjoys digging into carbs, such as pizza and French baguette, on his \"cheat\" days. “Usually, I’ll allow myself to eat whatever I want on those days, then when I get back to my healthy diet, I stick to it.” He is clear about his goals and pursues them with unwavering dedication. In his shoes, I doubt I would have the same level of determination. To young, aspiring fighters who dream of a career in MMA, Adrian offers this advice: “As long as you have the heart, motivation and the will to win, you’ll be able to achieve your dreams and goals in MMA.” Read more of the latest in Subscribe to get daily news updates, insights and must reads delivered straight to your inbox.

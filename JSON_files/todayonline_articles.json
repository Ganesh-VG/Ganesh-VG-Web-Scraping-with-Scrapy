Hana Chen Published November 27, 2022 Updated November 28, 2022 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn My grandmother always holds my hand when we cross the road. It’s a habit from when I was between four and six, back when I was not yet able to go to the neighbourhood hawker centre by myself. At traffic lights, she’d grasp my hand tightly, and remind me that the red man meant “stop” and the green man meant “go”, that I had to look left and right, and that I wasn’t allowed to let go of her hand at all. Not until she said it was okay. Back then, I had to reach up to hold her hand. In my memory, I always looked up at my Ah Ma. She never loomed over me, or seemed too big or too grand, but there was always this slight sense of awe — that this elderly lady was so much older and so much wiser, and someone I could trust to lead me safely. Growing up, I always knew that my Ah Ma loved me. She never said it much — verbal declarations of love were never really a huge thing for her. Instead, she showed it in the little things. In primary school, my younger brother and I were almost always at my Ah Ma’s house. She’d make us lunch after the school bus dropped us off, convinced that the portions served in the school canteen weren’t enough to sustain us. There’s a Bible verse to describe love: “Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.” In Ah Ma’s case, love is also strict. It makes sure that homework is always completed before play, that toys are kept before dinner, and that children are obedient and polite. But her love is also gentle — combing my hair after a shower to ensure that there were no split ends, feeding me snacks as I did my homework, softly patting my back until I fell asleep. DIALECT DIFFERENCES Sometimes, though, I wish talking to her was easier. Ah Ma’s first language is Hokkien, and she also speaks Malay, Mandarin, and a handful of other dialects. She understands the bare bones of English — those commonly used words like “school” and “apple” and other things that get said often around her. In contrast, English is my first language. I can hold a conversation in Mandarin, yes, tripping over my words slightly and struggling through the different tones. I can understand bits and bobs of dialect, but I’m hopeless at navigating a conversation without the help of somebody else. This language barrier is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in our relationship. Nuria Ling/TODAY Gen Z Speaks writer Hana Chen is seen here in this photo taken on Nov 20, 2022. When I was a child, conversations about watering the plants or common household chores were elementary. I’d jabber away in a mixture of Mandarin and English, and Ah Ma would simply just understand. Life was a lot simpler, so communication was also easier. But as I grew up, it has become difficult. Talking to my Ah Ma can turn into an extremely unsatisfying game of broken telephone, going back and forth as we try to decipher the meaning behind each other's words. This only gets worse with more complex topics, especially social issues that youth are passionate about. Understanding mental wellness, for example, is not as simple as using the Mandarin word or phrase for the topic. Things get lost in translation when I explain to her about the importance of mental health, and how it permeates our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, even in a language that she knows well. Time and time again, I run into the same issue — trying to explain why something matters to me as Ah Ma looks on in patient confusion. It’s not that she doesn’t care, or that she’s not smart enough, because she certainly is. But I think she doesn’t understand it the same way I do because we were brought up differently. BRIDGING A GENERATIONAL GAP Ah Ma was born in 1941 in tumultuous times. She was the eldest daughter in a poor family that lived in a kampung and has no formal education. She became a seamstress by trade, and eventually married my Ah Gong, a construction worker who hailed from Fujian. As my family tells me, Ah Ma grew up worried about earning money, about sending her children to school and making sure that there would be food on the table each day. I am fascinated by the stories of her life because they tell me about Ah Ma before I was born. She was the strict mother who pushed her children to study, the thrifty wife that ensured that her family’s needs would always be met. To me, she has always been my sweet grandmother, and it’s so strange to imagine her going through the long, hard life she had before I came along. At times, I wonder how she sees me in return — will I always be the baby she first held years ago, no matter how much I've grown? I was born in 2003, just over sixty years later. I’m also the eldest daughter and my family lives in an apartment. I've never had to even consider giving up my studies to support them, and I can study what I’m passionate about and look for a job in that field. My concerns are more abstract, in a sense. I’m worried about small things, like which university I’ll go to, and how much schoolwork I have, and I’m worried about big things, like global warming and social media addiction and all those other issues that seem to keep popping up. We both care about current affairs or the world around us, but I think it matters to us both in a different way. Ah Ma’s life centred around her day-to-day struggle, and even now, she only remembers historical events in the way they relate to her life. So, the rise and fall of the Berlin wall? To her, it is irrelevant, despite it being a major historical event. Singapore’s “Two is Enough” campaign? Well, it happened when my uncle was born, and she recalls being told off by nurses for having a third child. I can’t blame my Ah Ma for not being interested in the issues that I feel so strongly about, in the same way that she doesn’t blame me for being able to empathise with the problems she had in her life. MUTUAL RESPECT AND LOVE Is it selfish, I once asked a friend, to want her to care about the same issues as I do? Should I just confine my conversations with Ah Ma to banal retellings of what I did over the week? A part of me recoils at the thought. Ah Ma has always been the person that I’ve gone running to when in trouble, and she’s always significant in my life. I want her to know about the things that I care about. But as I grow older, I also want to learn about her view of the world too. It is about mutual respect, and love, and wanting to do the best thing for the other in our own way. Nuria Ling/TODAY Ms Hana Chen is seen here with her grandmother. Recently, I bought coffee for Ah Ma — an iced vanilla latte with oat milk. Half of those words are English gibberish to her, but she took a sip anyway. She grimaced and said that it was too bitter and too cold and eventually she told me that I should drink more warm water instead of ‘kopi peng’ (ice coffee). It wasn’t about getting her to like the same coffee as me. It was about letting her have a taste of something that I enjoy, and leaving it at that. I know that she loves me, and because of this, she cares about my life and the things that I like. I will keep trying to bridge the gap with her, to ask her about her life and find our common ground. She is now 81, while I am 19. These days, I’m much taller than her, and a far cry from the six-year-old who she had to escort safely across the road to get to the hawker centre. It’s a sign of the times — a natural progression over the years that shows itself in the little things. It’s also a reminder that as a young adult, I am capable of helping her in the same way she once helped me. Nowadays, I slow my steps to match her pace, just as she did to match mine when I was smaller. I reach out to carry her groceries, the same way she always reached out to carry my school bag in the past. But Ah Ma still holds my hand when we cross the road. Even now, she runs through her checklist of reminders before we cross the road: Look both ways, don’t cross before it turns green, don’t stop to pick up anything lest I get hit by a car, and don’t let go of her hand.

Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Gen Y speaks profile Garialdi Salim. Garialdi Salim Published July 23, 2023 Updated July 23, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Last year, I decided to join an online reality dating show called One Week Love. The show premiered on The Smart Local’s YouTube channel in October 2022 and follows a similar format to Netflix’s Singles’ Inferno, where nine contestants try to find love in seven days. The show grew in popularity, striking a chord, especially with the Gen Zs, who were waiting in anticipation for a new up-and-coming dating reality show. And while I would gladly go through this experience of being on a trendy online show all over again, I’m not sure if I can confidently say that this is an experience for everyone. When I first heard about the casting call, I jumped at the opportunity, just because of how different I knew this experience would be from my day job. I am a senior strategy and consulting analyst at Accenture, a global professional services firm. In my role, I work closely with clients, dedicating extensive time to conducting in-depth research and assisting them in tackling complex business challenges. Life on a “reality” show and my actual day-to-day reality seemed to be worlds apart. I thought One Week Love came at an opportune time, right when I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and meet new people. After all, how many 27-year-olds can say that they have been a contestant on a reality dating show before? So, while I went in thinking I would be the carefree spirit who would go home with a date to call their own, the story changed when the cameras went on. LIFE AS THE ANTAGONIST Reality shows feed on drama, and I knew that when I signed up. But I just never expected myself to be caught in the series of developments that ensued. For example, in the earlier episodes where my castmates thought I was being “too close for comfort” because I was helping another female castmate adjust her microphone. In the later episodes, I was called out by one of my castmates as the one who really “needed to work on their social cues” during a segment called “Unfine Dining”, where castmates have to pick between answering a difficult question or be forced to eat a nauseating dish. But it was the overall narrative that I had no control over, and I was at the mercy of the producers and editors. To keep the long story short, I gradually became seen as the antagonist. Whether that is fair or not, I would leave readers to judge if they happen to watch the show. But I wanted to pen this piece, perhaps as an epilogue to the series, but also to put it out there about what life was like for me after the cameras turned off. It was demoralising being perceived as the antagonist, but I continued believing in myself and my intentions. I admit to initially being upset when I realised what was happening. I chose to bite my tongue and held back the desire to go into defensive mode, opting instead to hear them out, which helped defuse the situation. With all cameras on you, every micro-expression was captured. I didn’t know what other castmates thought of me at the time, but I knew my actions and how I reacted were within my control. WATCHING THE SHOW I watched the show when it finally got posted online several months later. Listening to the participants describe their first impressions of me was quite a surreal experience, akin to hearing your recorded voice for the first time. But I was also nervous about how I would be perceived, and indeed, it was initially quite shocking scrolling through the comments and reading what the public thought of me. I wasn’t portrayed in the most positive light by the ladies in the show, several comments popped up in the earlier episodes on my behaviour, with some even calling me a “creep”. To be honest, those comments stung. But I kept my head in check and chose to put those comments aside. I told myself that how I was portrayed in the show was not a definition of who I really was as an individual. Nonetheless, I watched these episodes with a bunch of friends or had watch sessions with my fellow castmates, as it made it easier to be less self-critical of my performance. Having the company also made the experience less confrontational, and more manageable. Nearly ten months after the show was broadcast, I’ve gotten past most of these comments. It helped that #JusticeforGari eventually became a trending term nearing the final few episodes when people started realising how severely misunderstood and misrepresented I was on the show. I felt vindicated by the hashtag and the positive public comments about me that flooded the comments section. Thank goodness for those. Coming out of the show, while I did not “find love” as I had initially expected, I found myself in the company of the few castmates who I can now call my friends. I’m also incredibly proud of the experience I’ve gained on the show — I stuck to my guns, and was authentically “me”, and I wouldn’t have changed anything even if I were to do it all over again. At my job at Accenture, I learnt that a consultant’s first impression is almost as important as the strength of their counsel in building trust with and gaining the respect of our clients. Though I was intimately familiar with the importance of perception, I realised from my experience on the show that as hard as I tried, I could not control how I was going to end up being perceived. Even though I have learnt to peg this roller-coaster of an experience as being a part of “show business”, I cannot deny the struggles of having to maintain public perceptions, especially when it is amplified across social media, and spotlighted in the public’s eye. Safe to say, I’ve not just taken a step out of my comfort zone when I decided to join One Week Love, but I’ve run deep into the horizon with it. From the show, one of my greatest takeaways is learning that most of the time, all we can do is roll with the punches, learn from our mistakes, and aim to emerge a better person, a mindset that I’ve carried with me till now in my day-to-day life.

Many Malaysians relocate to work in Singapore for better opportunities, higher salaries and advantageous exchange rates The Malaysian government recently released an official study into Malaysians living in Singapore, and warned of the \"adverse effects\" of the brain drain as skilled workers leave Malaysia Economists and experts told TODAY that Malaysia's talent exodus has not reached a dire level yet, but if left unchecked, could eventually hamper its economic growth and development This would also not be in Singapore's interest, given how closely intertwined both countries' economies are Malaysian workers whom TODAY spoke to said Malaysia must address political stability and pay gap as well as invest in infrastructure to encourage its diaspora to return By Amanda Yeap By Amanda Yeap Published March 1, 2024 Updated March 5, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Despite having a successful sales career, a workplace with supportive colleagues, and a stable relationship in Malaysia, Ms Anna Chin still felt something was missing. And so, like many of her fellow compatriots with big dreams, the Malaysian started considering looking southwards: Singapore. “I got hold of an opportunity from a recruiter, which made me contemplate whether moving to Singapore would be a good decision. “Since Singapore and Malaysia have similar cultures, food, and languages, I thought it would be nice to have the opportunity to work overseas but in a place that doesn’t feel too different from home,” she told TODAY. Ms Chin, who holds a bachelor’s degree in science, thought she could benefit from the regional experience. She had expected to stay in Singapore for just a few years and then head home. Fast forward to six years later, the 33-year-old medical sales executive is now a Singapore permanent resident, happily married to a Singaporean, and is looking for a flat as her forever home here. Considering how her life had taken an unexpected turn since she uprooted herself, Ms Chin said she plans to have children and settle down in Singapore for good. “After moving, I feel less connected to home. I miss my family. It’s a little sad that I am the only one missing out on important events and gatherings like Chinese New Year and birthdays. “But my life is here now, and to the Chinese, it’s customary to follow and stay with your husband’s side of the family,” she said. Ms Chin has three siblings, aged 31, 45, and 48, all still living in their hometown of Ipoh. Ms Chin’s experience will surely resonate with the Malaysian diaspora residing and working in Singapore. Take Ms Audrey Yeap, for example. The 30-year-old, who works as a senior executive in branch operations at a local bank, married a Singaporean citizen after working and living in Singapore for seven years. The Ipoh native moved to the Lion City in 2016 right after graduating from university, having no prior work experience in Malaysia other than a three-month internship in Kuala Lumpur. “When I was just a kid, my parents took me to Singapore for the holidays. Back then, I didn’t know anything about the currency exchange rate or the strength of the dollar. “All I knew was a PlayStation Portable cost about S$200 then, but in Malaysia, it was around RM800. I only understood figures, and thought it would be great to live in a place where I didn’t have to pay so much for things I wanted,” she told TODAY. As she grew older, Ms Yeap eventually realised that earning Singapore dollars would mean increased spending power, thus reinforcing her belief that Singapore was an attractive country to relocate to. Conversely, Malaysian technology startup founder Joshua Lee (not his real name), 40, had never considered moving to Singapore all his life. Still, he found himself mulling over it after being offered the role of chief technology officer at a local firm more than two years ago. “My business was affected after Covid-19, and I had to make a decision to protect the well-being of my staff,\" said Mr Lee, who declined to be named. “So when a Singaporean boss offered to buy my company and relocate me to work for him in the Singapore office, while retaining all 13 workers to work from home in Malaysia, I accepted it.” Last year, Malaysia's then Human Resources Minister V Sivakumar, said that as of 2022, 1.13 million out of 1.86 million Malaysians who migrated abroad were living in Singapore. While Singapore alone absorbs over 60 per cent of Malaysia’s diaspora, most of the remainder reside in countries located on the other side of the world, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Ms Anna Lim, 32, is one of them. Now based in California, she said that many of her friends had left Malaysia for Singapore in search of better pay and opportunities. “Even growing up, I was encouraged to find work elsewhere, such as Singapore or China. Also, I am interested in game development and the entertainment industry, and I am more likely to find a high-paying job in those industries in the US than in Malaysia. “Malaysia still does not value the arts in the way it should, even though many game studios are based there. Unfortunately, money talks,” she said. Before being retrenched recently, Ms Lim, who hails from Penang, was a data analyst at a television technology company in San Francisco. Although many young, bright Malaysians grow up under their home country’s education system, they may harbour dreams and aspirations that cannot be fulfilled at home. Hence, countries as near as Singapore and as far as the US become talent magnets. But what does this mean for Malaysia if a significant proportion of its young, skilled labour force seeks long-term work outside of the country with the possibility of permanent relocation? A Malaysia governmental study in 2022, released last week , revealed that more than half of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore have tertiary-level qualifications. Of those employed here, nearly three in four, or 74 per cent, are skilled and semi-skilled workers. A media statement released by the Malaysian authorities about the study warned of the “adverse effects” of the brain drain as skilled workers leave the country. TODAY looks at the broader implications of this talent outflow on Malaysia’s workforce and economy, and how this may adversely impact Singapore if the phenomenon continues on a greater scale. SEEKING GREENER PASTURES IN SINGAPORE Malaysians working in Singapore and Brunei are generally attracted by good job prospects, stable employment, attractive salaries, and an advantageous exchange rate, according to the Malaysian government study released on Feb 19. It was conducted by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, an agency under the Prime Minister’s Department, and the Ministry of Economy. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Malaysians working in Singapore and Brunei are generally attracted by good job prospects, stable employment, attractive salaries, and an advantageous exchange rate, according to the Malaysian government study. On career planning, 62 per cent of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore polled said they would continue working abroad, while the remainder voted for “no” or “not sure”. The study also found that most Malaysians tend to work in Singapore for at least three years, with 33.2 per cent staying for three to five years. Meanwhile, 48.4 per cent have stayed here for six years or more, and 3 per cent have migrated. More than two-thirds of those living and working here earn a gross salary of S$1,500 to S$3,599 a month. However, the study did not indicate the total number of Malaysians surveyed. Ms Ashlyn Ong, 32, has braved the daily commute between Johor Bahru and Singapore for over six years for the sake of enjoying higher spending power thanks to the strong Singapore dollar. “When I left, the exchange rate (of S$1 to ringgit) was around 2.9 or 3.0. Now, it’s at 3.5 and rising. “Earning RM2,500 and S$2,500 is completely different. You can buy a lot more things with S$2,500, but with RM2,500, it’s easily spent with no savings left.” Although she resigned from her position as a customer service officer in Singapore in January to take a break from the toll of the gruelling daily commute, Ms Ong told TODAY that she would still look for another job in Singapore once she is ready to get back to the grind. Ipoh-based beautician Tracey Tan, 33, decided to move to Singapore with her husband in 2018 to work shortly after giving birth to her son. With a combined household income of around RM5,000 (S$1,413) then, the couple needed more savings to ensure they could comfortably bring up their child . In Singapore, she was hired for the same job as a beautician, while her husband was hired as a cook, and they collectively earned around S$5,000 (RM17,600). “We were so fortunate that we decided to come home in January 2020, right before Covid-19, because our son needed to be ferried to kindergarten, and his nanny didn’t know how to drive,” she said. Ms Tan, who now lives and work in Ipoh, said she cherished the opportunity of working in Singapore because she could save a lot more in ringgit after converting her Singapore dollar savings. “If I didn’t have a kid, I would have probably continued working in Singapore because I can get more savings faster and achieve my dream of bringing my whole family for an overseas trip together.” Singapore’s safety and reliable public transport were also pull factors for Ms Yeap, the bank employee . “I love how safe Singapore is. It is also easy to commute everywhere. When I had just arrived here, I could rent a room near my workplace, so commuting to work was a breeze. “(During) my internship experience in Kuala Lumpur before graduation, I had to endure a 1.5-hour jam to get to work and then another 1.5 hours to get home,” she said. For engineer Jonathan Lim, besides Singapore’s strong currency, working abroad has always been on his bucket list and that Singapore is a good starting point. The 27-year-old Kuala Lumpur native said: “I also think I should explore more at my younger age, before having significant commitments such as family and mortgage in Malaysia.” Mr G Peremkumar, 32, a senior staff nurse at a private hospital, said he moved to Singapore almost 10 years ago seeking exposure to a better healthcare system. “The Singapore healthcare system is completely different (from Malaysia), especially in terms of patient experience and patient care,” said the Penang native who worked for over two years as a nurse in Malaysia. “Compared to my experience back in Malaysia, where I didn't think I was learning from the best practices, I get to grow and learn a lot more from the people here who have higher, stricter standards.” In response to TODAY's queries, Ms Janice Foo, head of people at professional services firm KPMG, said that it aims to “attract the brightest minds from anywhere in the world”. It sees a “healthy number of applicants from Malaysia who exemplify these qualities, and many of them have chosen to build thriving careers with us”, she said. “Certainly, employees from Malaysia may see Singapore’s proximity and reputation as a vibrant business hub as factors that are beneficial to them.” Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Commuters board a bus to Johor Bahru from Kranji, Feb 28, 2024. A Malaysia governmental study in 2022 revealed that more than half of the Malaysian diaspora in Singapore have tertiary-level qualifications. BRAIN DRAIN'S LONG-TERM IMPACT With Singapore being the preferred work destination for Malaysians looking to work abroad, Malaysia's chief statistician Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in his statement accompanying the study that the country needs a shift in perspective to address the brain drain. He said it is bound to have an adverse financial effect, considering that a significant portion of those employed abroad had received their education in Malaysia. “Malaysia must reframe the narrative around brain drain, transforming it into a positive concept known as ‘brain circulation’. “This shift in perspective means that the Malaysian diaspora will eventually return to Malaysia after a predetermined period, thereby contributing their acquired expertise and experiences back to the country,” he said. Dr Mohd Uzir also said the Malaysian government needs to adopt a holistic approach — extending beyond the confines of government ministries and agencies — to leverage the “brain circulation” concept as a strategy. He emphasised that efforts should not just focus on bringing Malaysians back to their home country, but also on utilising their skills to benefit Malaysia while ensuring their well-being upon their return. “The ability to reshape the Malaysian labour market will not only bolster the economy but will also, in the long term, exert an indirect influence on factors such as the Malaysian ringgit currency rate, wage levels, and advancements in automation and industrial mechanisation.” Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, in addressing the brain drain issue last September, said that his administration was looking into ways to attract skilled Malaysians to return and contribute to the country. “Top scholars, top economists, top accountants are leaving (the country) or have left, so now we have to make sure that we have a system that could encourage them to come back with the incentives,” he said during a visit to New York. Malaysian and Singaporean economists whom TODAY spoke to said that Malaysia’s brain drain has not reached a dire level yet, but the effects would still be felt in the long term. If left unchecked, the continuous loss of talent would eventually hamper economic growth. Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng said the outflow to Singapore had not adversely affected Malaysia's labour market, given the existing slack. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, there were 187,800 unemployed graduates at the end of 2022, a decrease of 5.5 per cent from the previous year. The graduate unemployment rate was 3.7 per cent, which, according to Dr Yeah, was “marginally lower” than the overall unemployment rate of 3.9 per cent in 2022. “The rise in labour force participation rate, both overall and for graduates — together with the present level of unemployment — suggests that the country’s manpower needs are being met,” he said. Dr Yeah said Malaysia’s current “brain drain” may not be as bad as that experienced during the 1970s and 1980s due to its labour surplus. “It is nevertheless concerning as the outflow of talents could dent the country’s structural upgrading to a higher value, innovation-driven and knowledge-based economy. “In the longer term, the loss of talents could hamper the country’s aspiration to be an advanced and high-income nation,” he said. Dr Yeah, who is one of the five advisers to Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance, added that if not for the loss of human capital, the nation “could well have become developed and achieved high-income status a decade or two earlier”. Associate Professor Alwyn Lim, from the Singapore Management University (SMU), echoed Dr Yeah’s sentiments, saying that Malaysia’s population is “large enough” to mitigate any economic impact from migrating skilled workers. Malaysia has an estimated population of 33.7 million, compared with Singapore’s 5.92 million. “In that sense, I do not see an economic impact large enough to slow down co-prosperity efforts,” he said, referring to Singapore's and Malaysia's economies’ co-dependence. Assoc Prof Lim, however, noted that the economic contributions of nearly a million Malaysian workers are not insignificant. “Many workers in Malaysia can perform lower-skilled work, so the more concerning trend would be higher-skilled Malaysians who choose to work in Singapore, or elsewhere, whose skills cannot be easily replaced and whose value contributions to the economy may be higher. “Higher-skilled Malaysian migration will probably continue to increase, and this will be a limitation for those domestic sectors in Malaysia that rely on the value contribution of higher-skilled Malaysians,” he said. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Malaysian and Singaporean economists whom TODAY spoke to said that Malaysia’s brain drain has not reached a dire level yet, but the effects would still be felt in the long term. WHY MALAYSIAN WORKERS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND While many of Malaysia’s skilled and semi-skilled workers are eager to seek their fortunes abroad, they are also much sought after by employers in Singapore grappling with rising costs and manpower shortage. Mr Clement Tan, director of Malaysia recruitment agency Talent Recruit, said while he serves clients from various sectors looking to hire Malaysians, healthcare and education stand out in terms of demand. “Cost is the main priority from the clients’ side. Secondly, they feel that Singaporeans can be rather choosy, making it challenging for them to hire Singaporeans, especially for lower-level positions such as operator, retail worker, and kitchen worker,” he said. Mr Jim Wee, director of Singapore-based recruitment firm Nala Employment, said most of his clients would start considering Malaysian candidates for the job if they are unable to hire locally after a month. As the firm specialises in hiring Malaysians, around 90 per cent of its clients, mostly from the manufacturing, engineering, and hospitality sectors, would approach the firm looking for these workers. “Malaysian candidates are often considered the next-best alternative to other nationalities due to the culture and language, which are the closest to Singapore. \"The hiring process is quicker for Malaysian candidates, as they can attend face-to-face interviews within a few days if shortlisted,” said Mr Wee. While it is widely believed that foreign workers are cheaper, Mr Hazmi Zin, a third-generation owner of Rumah Makan Minang restaurant, disputed this, saying it costs about the same for him to hire a local and a foreigner. Malaysians currently make up one-third of his business' 40 workers. Nuria Ling/TODAY While it is widely believed that foreign workers are cheaper, Mr Hazmi Zin (2nd from left), third-generation owner of Rumah Makan Minang restaurant, disputed this, saying it costs about the same for him to hire a local and a foreigner. “For Malaysian Work Permit holders, the basic salary is around S$1,500, with additional earnings from overtime work. We also need to consider levies, which range from S$350 to S$800, depending on their educational background,” he said. The foreign worker levy is a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreigners in Singapore. Employers must pay a monthly levy for Work Permit holders. Besides the monthly pay, Mr Hazmi also provides lodging, which costs S$500 to S$600 a month per person. In total, a single foreign worker would cost nearly S$3,000 to hire. In comparison, local workers are paid between S$2,000 and S$2,400, excluding Central Provident Fund contributions. Having relied on Malaysian workers for years, Mr Hazmi said their turnover rate can be high because they would go home once they have worked for a couple of years and hit their savings targets. “When given a choice, I would prefer to hire local workers, but because of the nature of the job, it is difficult to operate solely with locals,” he said. The hairdressing industry in Singapore faces similar struggles. Chez Vous salon chief director Serene Tan said while they prioritise Singaporeans in the hiring process, they have no choice but to recruit workers from Malaysia due to a lack of local talent. “Many salons actively seek out locals with hairdressing experience, offering higher pay and benefits to attract them. However, the hairdressing industry is not favoured by Singaporeans, despite offering competitive pay compared to graduates,” she told TODAY. Ms Tan attributed the lack of interest to several factors, such as low starting pay, weekend work, and irregular hours. “Many also perceive the profession of a hairdresser as lower-skilled, or it is for those who ‘cannot study’.” Agreeing with Mr Hazmi’s on the pay issue, Ms Tan said hiring Malaysian workers is not necessarily cheaper due to the foreign worker levies. “In some cases, hiring Malaysians with higher education levels may incur higher costs than hiring locals.” With the rise of remote working, some Singaporean employers look to hire Malaysians to support operations without having to move here. Mr Keith Tan, founder and chief executive officer of Crown Digital, a tech startup behind Singapore’s first robot barista Ella, is one such example. Explaining his decision, he said hiring in Singapore can be highly challenging due to a limited pool of tech talents who seek “premium” salaries upon graduation. “A fresh graduate from NTU (Nanyang Technology University) demanded a pay of S$6,500. The high labour cost in Singapore makes business operations unsustainable, as workers often seek substantial pay increases after a year. “I am looking to Malaysia because of a larger talent pool that does not come at a ‘premium’ cost,” he said. Asked about Malaysia’s brain drain impact on Singapore, Assoc Prof Lim of SMU said the economic migration is largely positive as the Republic’s falling birth rate means it requires more workers from abroad to sustain or accelerate its economy. “There will, however, be increased competition for that stratum of jobs that Malaysians seek in Singapore. Hopefully, this will encourage Singapore workers to add more value to their services or move up the skills ladder,” he said. Nuria Ling/TODAY Hairdressing salon Chez Vous has no choice but to recruit workers from Malaysia due to a lack of local talent. While Singapore seems to be reaping the economic benefits from Malaysia’s flow of skilled and semi-skilled talent into the country, economists also told TODAY that not everything would be rosy in the long run as the two will need each other to do well in order to thrive. Associate Professor Walter Theseira from the Singapore University of Social Sciences said that with the two economies closely intertwined, the success of one economy often mirrors the success of the other. “Take, for instance, firms headquartered in Singapore that conduct operations in Malaysia. A weak Malaysian economy could directly impact their profitability. “Moreover, as Singapore often serves as a regional hub for business services, any setbacks in Southeast Asian growth diminish its allure as an investment destination. We naturally prefer to see our neighbouring economy thrive, as any slowdown could indicate underlying issues with economic management or structural challenges,” he said. Similarly, Mr Song Seng Wun, an economic adviser at financial service provider CGS International, said that due to the strong intra-regional trade in the Asean region and Singapore's heavy reliance on external trade, any external shock would quickly impact its economy. Asean comprises Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, Brunei, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Cambodia. Hence, he said there is a mutual dependency among Asean countries. \"Currently, regional growth is resulting in higher-income jobs, increased disposable income, and greater demand for services. This growth fosters intra-regional trade and spillover effects. \"To Singapore, it is especially important. We want everyone to do well, so they can spend a few hundred dollars here to go to the Taylor Swift concert, for example,\" he said. HOW CAN MALAYSIA ATTRACT CITIZENS TO RETURN? With all that has been said and done about Malaysia’s brain drain, the question remains: What will it take for the Malaysian diaspora to feel incentivised to return home and contribute to their country’s economy? Audit associate Phua Jia Herl, 25, who has worked in Singapore for almost two years, said Malaysia must first fix its political issues. “If the political parties keep arguing with one another, it shows we are politically unstable. How can we attract foreign investments if that were the case?” The Kuala Lumpur native also stressed that political parties should refrain from exploiting racial issues and move past racial politics. “(Some politicians) often propagate negative videos on platforms like TikTok, inciting hatred towards other racial groups. This divisive behaviour may deter some Malaysians like myself from coming back.” He expressed hope that Malaysia could invest more in infrastructure, such as the rail network, as it would stimulate the economy and bring significant benefits. Mr Lim, the engineer working in Singapore, said there is a need for the authorities to invest not only in infrastructure but also in public services and amenities to improve the overall quality of life in Malaysia. “In the long run, when it comes to the family planning stage, returnees will also look for healthcare facilities for their parents, education systems for future generations, and reliable transportation networks, all of which play important roles in their lives.” Mr Fahad Naeem, country director at recruitment agency Randstad Malaysia, said that when it comes to talent attraction and retention, government initiatives and employer efforts must go hand-in-hand. He said this is especially important after Covid-19, with governments around the world introducing new talent attraction schemes to draw top global talent to work in their countries. “These initiatives help enhance the overall strength of their local workforce and fill the talent pool gap. However, these initiatives must be complemented with attractive career opportunities that companies in Malaysia can offer. “Besides matching salary expectations, many talents are looking for employers that can offer positive employee experiences.” Mr Fahad cited his company’s Employer Brand Research 2023 findings, which found that non-monetary benefits are important to 87 per cent of respondents. He noted that the top non-monetary benefits Malaysians look for are flexible work arrangements, being able to forge good working relationships with their managers and colleagues, and having more autonomy at work. Conversely, Dr Lee Hwok Aun, senior fellow and co-coordinator of the Malaysia Studies Programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said reducing the pay gap is paramount. “Malaysians residing in Singapore and working in semi-skilled and low-skilled jobs can be attracted to return to Malaysia, but it will be a challenge and requires further study. “But I would hypothesise that the job offerings may not be very different across the countries — noting the main semi-skilled occupations in the (Malaysian) study are clerical service work, machine operators, and service and sales workers — and hence earnings differential is the main factor,” he said. While economic factors such as higher salaries, higher spending power and better job opportunities prompted her to move to the other side of the world, San-Francisco-based Ms Lim said one of the reasons she moved to the US was also due to her sexuality. “I am bisexual and married to a woman. Personally, until attitudes towards LGBTQ people change, I don't think I'll be able to return. I would prefer to stay in a country where my marriage is acknowledged,” Ms Lim said, using the acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. “Outside of that, money and attitudes towards the arts would potentially sway me to come back — and a nice, heaping plate of char kway teow.” ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY DEBORAH LAU Related topics Malaysia exchange rate JOB MARKET Big Read Read more of the latest in Big Read Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-3QnU9E4ZO5E')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-6Z6Xv1l5D2c')); Trending Content is loading...

Unsplash Sudha Nair, Executive Director at Pave Published July 5, 2023 Updated April 27, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn To children, the fear of witnessing violence between their parents — the very same people who are supposed to care and protect them — is paralysing and unexplainable. The co-occurrence of child abuse and spousal violence has been widely documented. In the past financial year, 66 per cent of our own cases involved children who were both abused and witnessed violence between their parents. This has been consistent in the past couple of years. The impact of family violence on children can be detrimental and long-lasting. This is why the changes to the Women’s Charter, passed in Parliament on Tuesday (July 4), make sense. The new laws empower the authorities to issue emergency orders to stop perpetrators at the scene of high-risk cases of family violence. Such directives — which include stay away and no contact orders — send out a strong signal that violence in any form in a familial relationship is not condoned in Singapore. The laws also emphasise that families are important and that every member requires help. This includes children, adult survivors and perpetrators. Counselling has always been offered to all parties. What is different now is that should someone refuse help, it is now compulsory for them to comply. Mandatory treatment, especially for those with psychiatric conditions, opens the doors for social services to offer families the help they need. While most people adhere to the law, there is a small group who default on the services offered to them by the court. They defy orders such as the domestic exclusion order and continue to harm members of the family. Under the amendments, the message is clear that if offenders choose to breach any order, they face increased penalties, such as electronic tagging and arrest. The amendments also put the welfare of survivors at the forefront. When a survivor’s life is in danger or her judgement impaired because of trauma, emergency orders enable her to be removed to a safe place, allowing her to make decisions in an environment away from home and with professional support. I believe that the new laws are fundamental changes which will open doors for social services to move in early and provide the support necessary for the whole family, especially those who cause harm. This also sends a message to children who experience violence at home that there are adults who care enough to take another look at the law and change it, so families like theirs can heal.

By Nikki Yeo By Nikki Yeo Published May 12, 2024 Updated May 12, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — When she was a child, Ms Roslindah Aziz would spend her days playing pretend, imagining she was a young teacher reciting the alphabet to her students. She would lovingly \"cook\" meals too for her young charges and hand out homework sheets, reminding each of them to finish them on time. Her childhood dreams of being an educator however were put on hold when she went through a divorce at 25. With little help from her ex-husband, her career and dreams took a backseat as she focused her energies on placing food on the table for her then three-year old daughter. Over the last 15 years, the 40-year-old has gone through a myriad of jobs such as being a receptionist and a hair stylist, taking whatever came her way so that she could provide for her daughter in their one-room rental flat in Circuit Road. Decades after she first thought of being an educator, she got her big break two years ago to fulfill that dream. She now cares for a class of close to 30 primary school pupils from 11am to 7pm on weekdays as a student care provider in Big Heart Student Care Centre in Serangoon. “I love kids, but I never thought I could be a (student care teacher). To me, I thought maybe that job needs a really higher education, like a university certificate,” said Ms Roslindah, whose highest qualification is an N-Levels certificate. In 2022, her social worker referred her to Daughters of Tomorrow, a local charity that helps underprivileged women become financially independent and works mainly with individuals who reside in Government-subsidised rental flats. Ms Roslindah graduated from the charity's eight week Confidence Curriculum course where she received career coaching sessions and was recommended to her current employer, which is one of the charity's partners. The courses are designed to help women get back into the workforce and gain practical skills such as what to say during an interview. There are also workshops where mothers learn from other mothers on how they coped with their financial and family difficulties. A team at the charity then helps to provide these women referrals for stable employment. THE STRUGGLES OF DOING IT ALONE When she got married at 21, Ms Roslindah became a full-time homemaker after leaving her job as a receptionist. Her then husband took care of the bills and she was \"pampered\" by him, as he made arrangements for housing and daily expenses for her and her daughter. “I was young at that period of time, when the divorce happened, and I didn’t have the mindset of being afraid of life and didn’t think about what I would have to do to support my family,” said Ms Roslindah, who also supports her parents who are in their 70s. When her divorce was finalised and her ex-husband also stopped providing maintenance after three months, the realisation that she would now have to do everything alone hit her hard. \"It was most challenging to raise a child, because you're alone and this is your first experience, without for example a helper or parents' help. Money wise, managing finances was also hard, especially the starting two or three years,\" said Ms Roslindah. Returning to work was also difficult, as her daughter struggled with being separated from her. “It’s very hard for me to go out to work. Each time I wanted to go out, she would cry... When we needed to be separated, I really couldn’t focus on work at the start,” said Ms Roslindah, who declined to be photographed for this article. While her mother initially helped to take care of her daughter while she was working, she eventually sought out childcare options once her daughter was around four years old as her mother had health problems. Financial issues aside, Ms Roslindah was also unprepared for the negative comments she received as a single mum. People she knew and considered friends would say things like “I don’t think you can make it as a single parent” and “you will only be trouble to your parents, family, friends”. She has since learnt to brush off such comments. “I know a lot of negativity will be out there. I want to think positive, because it’s my life, no one is going to stop you or feed you and you have to stand up for yourself,” said Ms Roslindah. “Challenges are always there, it’s just that you need to have a brave face and do not ever give up.” STARTING FROM ZERO When she started her job at the student care centre, Ms Roslindah said she was not confident about her abilities and second guessed herself since she had no experience in the sector. But she soon decided to bring her experience as a mother and the lessons she has learnt over the years as a parent into the classroom. Her hard work has been rewarded with the “Extra Mile” award from her employer, which she obtained last year for her good attendance and the way she has interacted with the students in her care. While she was aware of the odds being stacked against her to enter this field, Ms Roslindah said she never gave up on the dream and was just waiting patiently for the right opportunity. “At last, I’ve achieved the goal. Even without a (higher education) certificate, I’ve achieved it. I didn’t think it was possible. It’s tiring, but I enjoy it,” she said. She now hopes to upgrade her skills and take courses so that she will one day be able to look after younger children in a childcare setting. Her other goal is to puchase a three-room flat so that her daughter, who recently graduated from Institute of Technical Education with a higher Nitec certificate in Passenger Services, can have a room of her own. Her daughter, Nish, she said, wants to become a Singapore Airlines stewardess or further her education at a polytechnic. \"She told me ‘Mommy, you don’t have to work, let me stabilise work for one year and then I’ll support you and make you have a comfortable life’,” Ms Roslindah said with a laugh. Her 20-year-old daughter said she was filled with joy to see her mother pursue her passion and make a positive impact on other children’s lives — the same way she did in her own life. When asked what she wanted to say to her mother, Nish said: “I want to express my deepest gratitude to my mom for her unconditional love, endless support, and tireless sacrifices. \"Thank you for being my rock and my inspiration.\" Related topics Mother's Day single parent motherhood Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-Uy5DDI56TNA')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-gXBGlfdUQ3k')); Trending Content is loading...

A 37-year-old Chinese national was fined $5,000 on Tuesday (May 14) for practising dentistry despite not being a registered dentist Ding Zhiyan had fixed dental veneers on her customers at her salon in Far East Plaza and in her flat in Bukit Merah She had learned how to fix veneers from her former employer By Loraine Lee By Loraine Lee Published May 14, 2024 Updated May 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — After learning how to fix dental veneers from her former employer, Ding Zhiyan started her own salon at Far East Plaza and provided these services between 2022 and 2023. In one instance, she fixed her customer's veneer in her home after the veneer dislodged a day after she installed it. A dental veneer is a thin layer of material placed over a tooth. On Tuesday (May 14), the 37-year-old Chinese national pleaded guilty to two counts of practising dentistry despite not being a registered dentist. She was fined S$5,000. Another four similar charges were taken into consideration. FIXED DENTAL VENEER IN HER HOME Ministry of Health prosecutor Tan Luoyi told the court that Ding, who is in Singapore on an S Pass, had learnt how to provide dental veneer services from her former employer at a salon in Bugis sometime in 2020 and would provide the services. She left the salon in February 2022, before setting up her own business at Far East Plaza along Scotts Road in May 2022. To provide dental veneer services, Ding purchased her equipment and supplies from e-commerce platform Taobao for 2,000 yuan (S$370). Ms Tan said as part of the veneer fixing service, Ding would check if customers had cleaned their mouths. Then she would ask her customers to rest on a bed or sofa, clean their teeth and file them to remove any plaque. After ensuring their teeth were clean, Ding would apply adhesive gel on the teeth before putting the dental veneers in place. Ding would then apply another gel to protect her customers' gums before shining UV light to harden the adhesive. Ms Tan told the court that on May 13, 2022 at about 2.33pm, Ding was informed that three dental veneers she installed on a customer in March 2022 had fallen off. Ding then arranged to meet the customer two days later at her salon and fixed them for S$100. Later that year on Dec 10, Ding performed her dental veneer service on another customer. However, the dental veneers dislodged and the customer complained. Ding arranged to meet the customer at her home in Bukit Merah the next day. There, Ding fixed the tooth during a 30-minute procedure for no charge as it was a \"form of service recovery\", said Ms Tan. The prosecution sought a S$2,500 fine for each charge Ding pleaded guilty to. This took into account the fact that Ding had fully cooperated with the authorities during investigations and had pleaded guilty at an early stage. Ms Tan added that Ding has not had any brushes with the law previously. Ding asked for a low fine amount as her mother has cancer and she needed money for medical expenses. In her brief sentencing remarks, District Judge Lorraine Ho acknowledged that no actual harm was caused to Ding's customers, although they needed \"some touch up\". For practising dentistry without a practising certificate and not being a registered dentist, Ding could have been fined up to S$25,000.

They were part of more than 1,000 residents from Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency (GRC) who had gathered for a special, historic occasion. First, to watch a live broadcast of the swearing-in of Mr Wong, 51, their Member of Parliament (MP) since 2015, and then to attend what can be considered his first grassroots event after he was sworn in as Singapore’s fourth prime minister on Wednesday (May 15). Mr Qayyum Lukman, 26, a production assistant and grassroot leader of the Yew Tee Youth Network who was among the crowd, said: “How often do you see your MP become PM? How many people can say that?” Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Prime Minister Lawrence Wong (right) shaking hands with his supporters as he stood in front of a human chain barrier. Ms Nusrat Jagin, a 54-year-old entrepreneur and grassroots volunteer, showed TODAY a picture she took with Mr Wong when he visited her home nearly 10 years ago when he was first elected MP for the GRC. Sitting at the front row of the watch-along event with her husband, Ms Jagin said that she was amazed at how a familiar and friendly face will now lead the country. “I have no doubt he’ll do well. He’s someone in touch with the people and has always cared for us. I’m sure he’ll keep at it,” she added. Loraine Lee/TODAY Ms Nusrat Jagin kept photos she had taken with and of Mr Lawrence Wong before he became prime minister. The watch party, dubbed \"May Day Sing Along\", was held on grounds within the constituency and organised by the People's Association. Together with his wife Loo Tze Lui and fellow MPs of the GRC Alex Yam, Hany Soh and Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Wong arrived to what looked like a hero’s welcome at around 10.30pm. He then gave a five-minute speech to the people gathered there, who cheered with gusto after every other sentence. “I decided to rush from the Istana tonight because I wanted my first event as prime minister of Singapore to be an event with all of you — residents of Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC,” Mr Wong told the crowd. “In my new capacity as prime minister, I hope you understand that from time to time, there may be new responsibilities that will make it difficult for me to attend some community events and activities the way I used to in the past. “But I assure you we have a very strong team… We will continue to work hard to provide a better home, a better living environment, and to take care of all your needs in Marsiling-Yew Tee.” Having spoken to try to manage their expectations of seeing him not as often in future in their constituency, Mr Wong stuck around until 11.15pm to take photographs with his eager supporters who lined up around a tentage. Unable to take photos with all of them, he took what the emcee dubbed as “Singapore's biggest wefie” before leaving.

Raj Nadarajan/TODAY People seizing the moment of the night with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong on May 15, 2024. For the Marsiling-Yew Tee residents, the evening started at 7.30pm — around three hours before his arrival — with a crowd of around 1,000 people having gathered at the tentage before the 8pm live telecast. While waiting for the ceremony to start, the people in Yew Tee were serenaded with a mix of English and Mandarin songs performed by several singers walking through the crowd, including a cover of American pop singer Taylor Swift's song Love Story. Mr Wong had played this song before on a guitar on his TikTok account. Raj Nadarajan/TODAY People in Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's constituency were in high spirits as they gathered to watch a live telecast of his swearing-in ceremony on May 15, 2024 The crowd then quickly settled down when the screen displaying the live telecast showed Mr Wong entering the grounds of the Istana at around 8pm. At least 100 more curious passers-by stood around the periphery and stuck around to watch the hour-long ceremony. Most of them had had dinner at Yew Tee Point next door or were heading home from work.

Most of the attendees consisted of older residents, but there were also some youthful faces in the crowd. One of them was 14-year-old Joseph Yap, a Secondary 2 student from Kranji Secondary School and a resident in Mr Wong's Limbang ward for 13 years. Joseph, who professed to have an interest in politics and decided to attend the communal watch party with his family, said that he had met the new prime minister several times during school events and showed a collage of pictures he had taken with Mr Wong. “He’s extremely down-to-earth and candid with us students,” he added. “I want to be here to congratulate him, wish him all the best and hope he’ll come by our school more.” Loraine Lee/TODAY Joseph Yap, 14, showing a set of photos he had taken with Mr Lawrence Wong before the latter became prime minister. Standing at the fringes was 21-year-old Republic Polytechnic student Bernice Hing, who spoke of her meeting with Mr Wong almost six years ago. She remembered being worried and panicking at a meet-the-people session, before Mr Wong sat her down and told her to relax — though she declined to reveal why she was there at the session to consult with him as MP. “He told me straight up what my options were (to the matter I presented to him) and consoled me that everything would be all right,” Ms Hing recalled. “He was calm and collected, and was willing to help everyone including me when I was still a teenager. That left a lasting impression… if I need help again, I’ll head to (Mr Wong’s) meet-the-people session.” OPTIMISTIC ABOUT FUTURE Like Mr Qayyum, Mr Lim Zhan Yang, 26, also a grassroot leader of Yew Tee Youth Network, which organises community events, was there to show his support for Mr Wong. Even though both he and Mr Qayyum work with MP Alex Yam closely because the network's activities are organised within Mr Yam's ward, their brushes with Mr Wong left a lasting mark on them, they said. When Mr Lim met Mr Wong during a Budget 2024 session, for instance, Mr Lim said that the finance minister's words had struck a chord with him. “For Gen Zers like me, being truthful, candid and willing to have a conversation is what we want for a prime minister, and that is who Mr Lawrence Wong is,” he said. “I hope in the future, he’ll continue engaging us and talk about topics (that we) youth care about like climate change, LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and others) and more.” When the residents had a music event for the GRC last year, Mr Wong supported the event and was excited for the line-up of performing artistes, including singer Benjamin Kheng. For Mr Qayyum, the new prime minister is someone “chill”. As for Ms Hing, Mr Wong’s inaugural speech as prime minister stood out for her when he acknowledged the more complex international landscape — which meant new challenges that he will have to face. However, she is confident that he would be able to do so. “If PM Wong remains true to himself and continues to keep Singapore together as promised, I’m sure we’ll be able to strive in this more complex international environment,” she added. Several residents attending the watch party held similar views as Ms Hing as they recounted past encounters with their MP. For 75-year-old retiree Chow Wui Nian, Mr Wong’s premiership has renewed his belief that Singapore will continue being a liveable place for his children and family to thrive. “This is (the young people's) prime minister, he is our future. I’m here to see history happen and hope that he’ll continue improving and growing Singapore for our next generation,” he said in Mandarin.

Loh Ping Huang, now 50, had been on bail for beating up a man and leaving him in a vegetative state, when he hit another man with a flowerpot. He pleaded guilty last month to a charge each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon and leaving Singapore at an unauthorised place of embarkation. He also pleaded guilty to being a member of a secret society from 2010 to 2022, and also for inviting a person to join the gang. Another six similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. Corrective training is a form of long-term incarceration to reform offenders and correct behaviours. It involves serving jail time for up to 14 years and is generally imposed on recalcitrant offenders who commit serious offences. Loh's sentence was backdated to Sept 26, 2022 when he was first remanded. WHAT HAPPENED According to court documents, Loh was accompanying a woman in her 20s to her home along Lorong 30 Geylang after a night of drinking on June 12, 2015. At about 7.15am, Loh, who was heavily intoxicated, thought that a man in his 60s was staring at the woman. Loh shouted at the man to leave, but he did not. The pair got into a verbal argument. The man picked up a plank and tried to swing it at Loh, but Loh punched the man repeatedly in the face, causing the man to drop the plank. As a result of the fight, the man was left in a vegetative state up until his death on July 25, 2019. An autopsy later showed that his death was caused by pneumonia complicated by a head injury. An underlying heart disease was also found to be a contributory cause of death, court documents stated. Loh was charged on June 13 in 2015 for the attack. While on bail, he got into a fight at a pub in Geylang on July 9, 2016. During the fight, he picked up a flowerpot and smashed it on a man's head, leaving him with bruises. Loh decided to flee Singapore sometime in mid-2016 to avoid going to prison for his crimes. Loh paid a Malaysian boatman S$6,000 to help him leave Singapore illegally. He boarded a boat near the Changi Point Jetty in order to reach Johor, Malaysia. Court documents did not state how the boat evaded detection by the Singapore authorities. Loh stayed in Malaysia for about three years before he decided to leave for Vietnam as he feared he would be arrested by Malaysian police and sent back to Singapore. To get to Vietnam, he stowed away on buses that went through Thailand and Cambodia, stated court documents. Loh stayed in Vietnam until he was arrested by the Vietnamese authorities and taken back to Singapore on Sept 26, 2022. In total, he was on the run for six years. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Timotheus Koh called for a corrective training suitability report last month, noting that Loh's \"history of lawlessness and violence\" and his absconding while court proceedings were ongoing showed the severity of the case. Loh's past offences include rioting with a deadly weapon and voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in 2000. For voluntarily causing grievous hurt, Loh faced up to 10 years' jail and a fine or caning. For voluntarily causing hurt with a weapon, the penalty is a maximum of seven years' jail, fine and caning For being part of a secret society, Loh could have been jailed for three years or fined S$5,000, or both. For leaving Singapore at an unauthorised place of embarkation, he could have been jailed up to six months or fined S$2,000, or both.

But Rajpal Singh, 34, was also acquitted of three other molest charges, after the judge found that the fourth victim had supported him through WhatsApp messages to the yoga studio’s owner and judged this to be “incongruent with her allegations of molest”. Singh, who is an Indian national, had earlier claimed trial to eight counts of outrage of modesty. He was accused of smacking his victims' buttocks and touching their private parts during his classes at a Trust Yoga outlet in Telok Ayer. The outlet has since closed down. None of the women can be identified because of a court order protecting their identities. The incident made headlines in July 2020 after a former student alleged in a viral social media post that she was sexually assaulted at one of Trust Yoga's studios. This later prompted more women to come forward with allegations that they, too, were molested by an instructor. The yoga studio said in a statement in August 2020 that the instructor involved in the incident had agreed to go on leave after internal investigations, and that Trust Yoga was cooperating with the authorities on the matter. Singh will be back in court on July 15 for sentencing. His bail was also increased by S$10,000 on Thursday to S$25,000. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that Singh had worked as a yoga instructor at Trust Yoga from April 1, 2019, and was on a two-year contract until March 31, 2021. In that time, Singh had molested the three women, who were aged between 24 and 29 at the time. Sometime in November 2019, Singh slapped the buttocks of his first victim while she was getting up from a yoga pose known as the forward bend. The victim felt \"disoriented, confused, angry and shocked\" when Singh touched her, the court heard. Despite this ordeal, she also continued to attend some of Singh’s classes as she wanted to “suppress the assault” and put the incident aside. She also contemplated raising the incident after the class, but ultimately decided not to as she was struggling to come to terms with it. In a separate incident occurring on two separate occasions between September 2019 and March 2020, Singh molested another victim while she was performing a yoga pose too. Likewise, the second victim continued with her lessons at the time of the incident as she had seen Singh doing the same to other students, who did not react. She thought at the time that this was just his “way of teaching”, the court heard. The victim only reflected upon these incidents when she subsequently read accounts of other girls online who had been through a similar situation, which convinced her that her experiences \"were not mere accidents as she had wanted to believe initially\". Later, on July 11, 2020, Singh molested his third victim by touching her private parts while she was in different yoga poses during a class. This was captured by a closed-circuit television (CCTV). Shocked and confused by his actions, the victim also did not immediately express her discomfort as she did not know how to react. But the truth came to light later when she spoke to a friend and her parents, and then informed Trust Yoga’s managers the next day, court documents stated. She made two police reports regarding the incident on July 13 and Aug 18 in 2020. The court also heard that the earlier two victims made police reports after that, following the posts by the third victim. The court also heard Singh was placed on leave of absence from Aug 3, 2020 following the accusations. INCONSISTENCIES In her oral judgement, District Judge Sharmila Sripathy-Shanaz highlighted several inconsistencies in Singh's testimony, such as him claiming to have touched a victim’s thigh in court although he had told the police that he touched her hip. She noted that Singh himself stated during the trial that no yoga adjustments would necessitate touching a student’s private parts. Singh had also told the court that he was “very careful” not to touch his student’s private parts when making yoga adjustments, said the judge. Even though all three victims did not sound out their discomfort to Singh immediately, the judge said their evidence was not undermined by their non-actions at the time of the offences. “Our legal system recognises that each individual’s reaction to trauma is unique and personal,” said the judge. “Therefore, the absence of immediate confrontation should not be viewed as a marker of the credibility or veracity of a complainant’s claim.” She added that it is important the court does not assess evidence based on “preconceived notions of how a victim should act or react, or in (Singh’s) words, what ‘common sense’ dictates.” Singh had earlier testified in court that the victims' post-incident behaviour had \"notable lapses in common sense\" which affected their credibility. Addressing the three charges against Singh that were withdrawn, the judge said evidence from the fourth woman was incongruent with her allegations of molest. This evidence, which District Judge Sripathy-Shanaz described as “continued active, unsolicited and vocal support” of Singh, refers to several WhatsApp messages the woman had sent to vouch for the instructor. “This gives rise to reservations about the reliability of her narrative, notwithstanding her explanations in court, and ultimately constrains a finding that her testimony is unusually convincing,” said the judge. For each count of outrage of modesty, Singh faces up to two years’ jail, or fined with or without caning, or any combination of such punishments.

By Ben Chester Cheong By Ben Chester Cheong Published April 2, 2024 Updated April 2, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Online harassment has become a pervasive problem in Singapore. Such acts of harassment include cyberbullying and doxxing — the act of revealing someone’s personal details or any other information that can identify them without their consent, such as their name, residential address, email address, phone number, or photograph. In the physical world, people are deterred from assaulting others due to the fear of severe legal consequences, such as lengthy imprisonment and even caning. However, the same cannot be said for those who doxx and cyberbully. Despite the lack of formal case reporting, informal platforms including Reddit threads such as r/SingaporeRaw provide glimpses at the negative impacts of such harmful behaviour, including emotional distress and reputational damage. There have also been multiple instances reported of cyberbullying victims driven to suicide — both ordinary, everyday folk as well as celebrities such as K-pop stars Sulli and Kim Jonghyun. In response to growing concerns, doxxing was included as an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act (Poha) from Jan 1, 2020. While the Act has offered some recourse for victims since its enactment in 2014, certain areas require further strengthening to effectively combat more forms of online harassment. STRENGTHENING LEGAL SAFEGUARDS Currently, most popular platforms, such as Google, Facebook and Reddit have policies which allow victims to put in requests to remove content that harasses or doxxes others. Notwithstanding this, most social media platforms and online forums have complex terms of conditions and content moderation practices that could inadvertently protect the perpetrator at the expense of the victim. This is because what legally constitutes doxxing is still a grey area — as such, these platforms reserve the right to draw and redraw the lines accordingly. Adobe Stock Most social media platforms and online forums have complex terms of conditions and content moderation practices that could inadvertently protect the perpetrator at the expense of the victim. Legislative enhancements could provide guidance on how platforms should handle situations where content moderation practices may inadvertently favour the perpetrator over the victim. Such legislative enhancements could institutionalise a standardised framework that govern how online platforms should react to doxxing content, what they should do, and when they should take down offending content. Although reporting systems exist, platforms’ responsiveness to complaints can be inconsistent. Enhanced legislation could set out the timeframe in which platforms must acknowledge and take timely action to remove content that violates anti-doxxing policies. In severe cases of online harassment that cross the line into criminal behaviour, legislation could require platforms to have clear protocols for escalating matters to law enforcement. This would ensure a more integrated approach between platform-level content moderation and the legal system in the most serious cases. Legislative enhancements could also mandate that platforms take proactive measures to prevent doxxing, such as platforms detecting and blocking attempts to share private information without consent. Platforms should also be required to err on the side of victim protection in ambiguous cases while still providing appropriate appeal mechanisms for accused perpetrators. Victims must be required to provide identity documents to prove that they are indeed the affected individuals when submitting a takedown request, in order to ensure it is a legitimate request. The victim should state clearly how the post doxxes them by providing illustrations of how their names, identities, photographs, and other personal information are mentioned. REMOVING THE CLOAK OF ANONYMITY It should also be made mandatory for all platforms that has a nexus to Singapore (such as a pool of Singapore-based users) to collect users’ mobile phone numbers during account registration. In today’s context, mobile phone numbers would be easily traceable to a user. Currently, many online platforms, such as Quora, Reddit and HardwareZone allow users to remain pseudonymous. In 2016, the University of Queensland’s David M Douglas noted that “de-anonymisation might be justified as a means of limiting or stopping such hate speech by increasing the speaker’s accountability”. Reuters Currently, many online platforms, such as Quora, Reddit and HardwareZone allow users to remain pseudonymous. This means that perpetrators of harassment would not only be more inclined to take down an offending post if their cloaks of anonymity are removed — they may even think twice before harassing others at all. Identification also makes it easier for victims to take legal action, if necessary, against perpetrators. However, once perpetrators’ identities have been privately revealed to victims for the purpose of seeking appropriate recourse, victims should in turn be placed under similar obligations not to publicly expose these identities. Making online spaces less anonymous and more transparent also makes it easier to hold individuals accountable for harmful actions and deter others from engaging in similar behaviour. GIVING VICTIMS MORE CONSIDERATION Poha criminalises various forms of harassment, both online and offline. It empowers the court to issue protection orders and expedited protection orders to stop the harassment and remove related content. While the Protection from Harassment Court aims to make it easier for victims to obtain remedies under Poha, this still involves legal proceedings and victims need to navigate the court process. Claimants who are unfamiliar with legal terminologies, processes or documentation would likely need to engage a lawyer. The idea of new legislative enhancements enabling victims to directly request takedowns of doxxing content from platforms based on pre-defined guidelines, without needing to go through the courts, could potentially fill the gap. Naturally, exceptions would have to be carved out to allow media outlets to report on news. As things stand, without a court order, it is entirely at online platforms’ discretion to accede to or reject requests from victims of doxxing to take down offending posts or to de-anonymise perpetrators. Victims could spend much time and effort wrangling with these platforms in order to remove the offending information. In these cases where the perceived lack of cooperation from online platforms allows perpetrators to avoid any consequences, victims have no other recourse but to give up and resign to their fates. Many victims end up exiting such platforms altogether, thus enabling and emboldening perpetrators to continue harassing others. Enhancing self-help mechanism allows for early intervention and removes the hassle and trepidation of having to go through the court system. NO PLACE FOR VIGILANTISM The cost to the online platform of removing an offending post upon receiving a complaint is negligible. On the other hand, requiring law enforcement to investigate and then request that the platform take down an offending post is a significant cost to society. Some critics argue that giving victims the power to request that online platforms remove harmful posts is a curtailment of the freedom of expression — but these naysayers fail to understand the very essence of such freedoms. Netizens who harass others to silence them and push them off online platforms and social media are the biggest impediment to freedom of expression. Doxxing on the pretext of individual vigilantism, while often motivated by a desire for justice or retribution, has no place in a well-functioning legal system. Empowering victims is the key to stop and prevent doxxing and cyberbullying. Improved self-help mechanisms would build upon, rather than duplicate, existing platform policies, thus helping to foster a more respectful and safer online community.

SingaporeEmbassyTokyo/Facebook The Singapore embassy in Tokyo. New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Published June 13, 2024 Updated June 13, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — A Singapore diplomat suspected of filming a male teenager at a public bath in Tokyo is expected to be charged in Japan on Thursday (June 13). The 55-year-old man, identified as Sim Siong Chye by Japanese broadcaster NHK, has returned to Japan for questioning by the police, local media reported on Thursday. The former counsellor at the Singapore Embassy in Tokyo arrived in Japan on June 9 following a request made by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department through Japan’s Foreign Ministry, reported the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Tokyo police then questioned him. On Thursday, they left the decision on whether to indict to the prosecutor. The indictment is expected to be filed later in the day. A counsellor is a diplomatic rank for officers serving overseas, such as in an embassy. According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a diplomat cannot be arrested. The case was first reported in February that the diplomat used his smartphone to secretly film a 13-year-old first-year middle school student in the changing room of a public bath. The boy was naked. Staff members at the public bath in Tokyo's Minato Ward reportedly called the police who, upon arriving, searched the diplomat's phone and found \"multiple naked photos of male customers\", according to Asahi at that time. It added that the diplomat refused to go to the police station but told officers he had taken such photos in other public baths. When asked to delete the photos from his phone, the diplomat \"deleted them on the spot\", reported the Japanese news outlet. He allegedly deleted 700 photos from his phone, which he told police he had taken in the six months leading up to the incident. Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Thursday that the man had admitted to taking the photos, saying \"I was unable to control my desires when I saw a man naked\". \"I took 20 to 30 (photos) myself,\" Asahi quoted him as saying, adding: \"I was surprised by the Japanese public bath culture and became interested in baths\". According to the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the diplomat had completed his tour of duty in Tokyo as scheduled and returned to Singapore in mid-April. He was suspended from his duties to assist in investigations. He did not inform the ministry about the incident until he was asked about it, said MFA. The ministry said on May 2 that it was prepared to waive diplomatic immunity to assist in investigations if necessary. According to NHK, citing Tokyo police, the man said he had regretted his actions and returned to Japan voluntarily to express his regret and speak as an ordinary citizen without diplomatic immunity. He also said that he had filmed the video with the aim of viewing it later and that he had no intention of targeting children. The NHK report quoted Tokyo police as saying that it was unusual for diplomats who have returned to their host countries to respond to police requests for questioning over alleged misconduct.

At one point, after his accounts were frozen and he had been warned by the authorities to stop such transactions, Chua even used an ex-colleague’s account to continue to do so. On Tuesday (June 11), the 59-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to two years and three months’ jail. Chua, who had no legal representation, pleaded guilty to five counts of assisting another party to retain benefits from criminal conduct. Three related charges were taken into consideration during the sentencing. In total he had helped to launder almost S$410,000. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that in January 2022, a police report was lodged over a POSB bank account belonging to Chua. He had used the account to receive monies on behalf of someone he met online and remitting the funds overseas. After investigations, the police issued Chua an advisory to refrain from dealing with funds from unknown or dubious sources. He was advised that if he continued doing so, he would be liable for money laundering. In October that year, Chua got acquainted with a person on Facebook known only as “Donald”. Chua confided in him that he owed about S$16,000 to moneylenders. Donald proposed that Chua provide him his bank account for Donald to use for transferring money. In return, Chua would get a 3 per cent cut of the funds being moved. Chua agreed and provided Donald with details of his UOB bank account. Chua would withdraw the monies transferred there and pass the cash physically to another person known only as “Andy”. The UOB account was frozen on Dec 1, 2022 following a police report. “The accused thus had reasonable grounds to believe that Donald was a person who was engaged in criminal conduct, and that the monies he received on Donald’s instructions were Donald’s benefits of criminal conduct,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li. In spite of this, Chua provided two more bank accounts — with HSBC and Maybank — to Donald so that he could continue to earn the 3 per cent commission. These accounts were frozen after victims of online scams lodged police reports, stating that they were duped into transferring money into those two accounts. “The monies that the accused received in the bank accounts, and which he withdrew and handed to Andy, were thus Donald’s benefits of criminal conduct,” said the prosecutor. After the freezing of the UOB account, Chua was summoned by the police to assist with investigations. He was told that the bank accounts provided to Donald had been used to receive proceeds from criminal conduct. Despite the warnings, Chua opened two more bank accounts — with OCBC and POSB — in May and August 2023 to continue his arrangements with Donald. And when these accounts were frozen, Chua in February this year approached an ex-colleague of his to receive money to be handed over to Andy. Chua promised him a 4 per cent cut of the funds transferred, but he did not tell the ex-colleague that his own accounts had been frozen for carrying out such activities. On Tuesday the prosecutor told the court that the ex-colleague was given an advisory by the police not to repeat the conduct. For each count of assisting another party to retain benefits from criminal conduct, Chua could have been jailed up to 10 years, fined up to S$500,000 or both.

A ranking police officer groped two full-time national servicemen under his charge during his active service The offences happened in early 2000s at the workplace The victims felt powerless at the time to flag up the incidents because they were concerned about reporting a senior officer Rama Shanker Singh, now 60 and retired, was sentenced to jail and to a fine on June 12 By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 12, 2024 Updated June 12, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Back when he was in active service as a ranking officer in the Singapore Police Force, Rama Shanker Singh groped two police full-time national servicemen (NSFs) under his charge on separate occasions. His actions in the early 2000s left the two male victims feeling humiliated and helpless, though they did not alert anyone to the incidents at that time because they were afraid to report a superior officer. On Wednesday (June 12), some two decades later, Singh’s actions caught up with him and he was sentenced to 24 days’ jail and a fine of S$20,000. He faces another 20 days' jail if he fails to pay the fine. Earlier this month, Singh, now 60 and retired from the force, pleaded guilty to two counts of using criminal force on the victims and one unrelated offence of possessing obscene films. One charge of outrage of modesty was dismissed amounting to acquittal, while four other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. The names of the victims cannot be disclosed due to a court order to protect their identities. District Judge Teoh Ai Lin took into account as aggravating factors Singh’s abuse of authority and the fact that he had used criminal force on each victim more than once. WHAT HAPPENED Court documents showed that Singh was a police officer from May 1984 to June 2016 and last held the rank of a superintendent before retiring. Among the postings he held were as chief investigation officer at Ang Mo Kio Police Division Headquarters (F Division) from August 2002 to August 2004. The first victim, now aged 42, served his National Service (NS) there as a crime administrative clerk at the time of the offence in 2003. “ He did not know how to react as he was being touched by his supervisor. He also did not think that men would be the subject of such offences. Deputy Public Prosecutors Tay Jia En and Gladys Lim ” Deputy Public Prosecutors (DPPs) Tay Jia En and Gladys Lim said: “Prior to the offence, (the first victim) respected the accused and had a positive view of him because he had witnessed the accused standing up for the police NSFs in the crime registry who were working under the accused.” Sometime that year, while the first victim was seated alone in a conference room collecting some investigation papers, Singh entered the room and closed the door behind him. He stood behind the victim and massaged his shoulders while telling him that he was attracted to him. Singh then kissed the top of the victim’s head while touching the victim's private parts over his clothes for a few seconds without consent. “He did not know how to react as he was being touched by his supervisor. He also did not think that men would be the subject of such offences,” the prosecution said. The victim left the room, feeling shocked and helpless, but did not report the matter because he was concerned that the completion of his NS may be jeopardised if he reported Singh, who was his supervisor and approving leave officer. Sometime between 2005 and 2006, the second victim was posted to the Security and Inspectorate Regulatory Department (SIRD) as part of his NS. Singh was posted there as head of compliance management. Singh reached out to the second victim’s direct supervisor and asked for the NSF to be attached to his team to assist him in conducting an outfield audit. At one point, the second victim was in a police saloon car with Singh. He was seated at the front passenger seat while Singh was the driver. While he was driving, Singh placed his left hand on the victim’s groin area and caressed the victim's private parts over the trousers. Singh withdrew his hand when the NSF said that he was uncomfortable about the action, but he did it again later. “(The second victim) felt angry and outraged by the accused’s actions but chose to keep quiet as the accused was his supervisor and senior officer,” the prosecution said. It added that the victim felt “embarrassed, ashamed, and humiliated as he was physically strong yet felt that he allowed the accused to touch him in that manner”. Court documents stated that the police were informed in December 2020 that Singh had allegedly committed the offences against the first victim during the latter’s NS days. After Singh was arrested that month and his electronic devices were seized, 170 obscene films were found. ‘POWERLESS TO REPORT HIM’ Seeking a short custodial sentence, DPP Tay on Wednesday said that Singh had abused his position of authority as a ranking officer in the police force. He added that the victims had felt “powerless” to report him for his actions. DPP Tay also said that there is a “concomitant need” to deter such offences, because victims of such acts would usually experience shame and would be reluctant to step forward to lodge a report, making such acts hard to detect. He added that Singh was persistent in his act, noting that there were similar charges taken into consideration, and that the nature of the touches were “highly intrusive” since they were at the victims’ private regions, albeit over clothes. Defence counsel Ramesh Tiwary, in pleading for a fine instead for his client, pointed to Singh’s clean criminal record before and after the offences. He said that Singh was also not the victims’ direct supervising officer, and maintained that the touches were for a few seconds and not prolonged unlike other more serious cases. He also said that his client would like to apologise to the two officers concerned over his behaviour. District Judge Teoh agreed with the prosecution's position that the threshold for a custodial sentence had been crossed for the use of force offences, given the aggravating factor. \"The offences had been committed in a workplace context by a higher ranking officer against victims who were NSFs working in a hierarchical environment,\" she said. For each count of using criminal force, Singh could have been jailed for up to three months or fined up to S$500, or both. For possession of obscene films, he could have been jailed for up to six months or fined up to S$20,000, or both.

Ryosuke Tanaka, 36, pleaded guilty to three counts of dishonestly obtaining services Tanaka received treatment at multiple dental clinics but told staff members there that he needed to use the toilet before paying He never returned after that In all, he cheated dental clinics of about S$7,000 Tanaka was sentenced to five months' jail for dishonestly obtaining services By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 12, 2024 Updated June 13, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — For years, Ryosuke Tanaka went to different dental clinics to get treatments and services worth anything from hundreds of dollars to almost S$3,000. After the treatment but before making payment, he would excuse himself to go to the toilet outside the clinic, never to be seen again. He could not be contacted after that as well. In all, he skipped more than S$7,000 in payments. On Wednesday (June 12), the 36-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to five months’ jail, after pleading guilty to three counts of dishonestly obtaining services. Four similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. WHAT HAPPENED Court documents showed that Tanaka sought root canal treatment from a dental clinic on Jan 18 this year. Although the name and full address of the clinic was not disclosed in court documents, the postal code showed that it was located in the Orchard Road area. Before the treatment, the dentist had explained to Tanaka the cost and number of appointments required for the treatment plan. Tanaka signed a form indicating the estimated costs. After a root canal procedure that lasted roughly two hours, Tanaka was asked to make payment of S$1,580.50. He told the clinic's workers that he was going to the toilet located outside the premises, left without making payment and did not return. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Cheronne Lim said that the clinic called four different contact numbers previously provided by the accused and sent messages via WhatsApp but did not receive a reply from him. She added that the dental clinic had provided treatment to Tanaka on four occasions in September last year and received payments for those. The dentist made a police report about the Jan 18 incident the next day. Tanaka repeated the same modus operandi at different clinics on Jan 23 and March 22 this year, with one of the treatments worth almost S$2,960. Each of the clinics filed police reports about the incidents. In addition to these incidents, Tanaka also obtained dental services worth more than S$2,200 at three clinics on four occasions from May 2020 to October 2022. Court documents did not state if police reports were made over these incidents, which formed the basis of the charges taken into consideration in sentencing. DPP Lim said that some of the services rendered to Tanaka were “semi-surgical” and the costs were significant. His actions also caused distress on the clinic's work crew who had to look for him in nearby toilets. They also tried to contact him multiple times. In mitigation, his defence lawyer Noelle Teoh said that the way he had cheated the clinics was not sophisticated and he did not make effort to conceal his act, since his personal and contact details were available to the clinics. She also highlighted that he had made restitution to all the clinics. For each count of obtaining services in a dishonest or fraudulent manner, Tanaka could have been jailed for up to 10 years or fined, or both.

The man, Tristan Teo Hong Xian, pleaded guilty in April to two charges of engaging in sexual communication with a minor and one of distributing an obscene image. Another charge of distributing an obscene image was taken into consideration for sentencing. His case was adjourned at the time to see if he would be suitable for a mandatory treatment order, which is a community sentencing option offered to offenders suffering from mental conditions that contributed to the offence. On Thursday, District Judge Wong Peck said the fact that there were multiple victims, their young ages and Teo's abuse of his position of trust were aggravating factors in the case. The children and the student care centre cannot be named under a court order to protect the identity of the victims. CASE BACKGROUND The court heard that Teo was working as a student care teacher in a primary school from April 2018 to February 2020. In the course of his work, he became acquainted with one of the victims, a boy, then aged 11, who was not in his class. In December 2019, Teo posted a picture of himself while on holiday in Japan. The boy was also on a holiday in Japan and added Teo on Instagram. The boy realised that Teo was a student care teacher at his school and they began communicating over Instagram. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) R Arvindren said that the initial conversation between the accused and the second victim was non-sexual in nature. Sometime in August 2020, the teacher began asking the boy about his private parts and told him that he wondered what they looked like as he was curious. Teo later admitted to the police that he wanted to \"hold back\" his sexual desires but eventually \"gave in to the temptation\", DPP Arvindren added. Around a year later, Teo got in contact with the second victim, a girl, then aged 13. She was also studying in the same school and was friends with the male victim. Teo communicated with the girl over Instagram and WhatsApp, and asked her to trade pictures of their private parts sometime between August and December in 2021. The girl declined to send a photo but Teo sent a one-time-view photo of his private parts to the victim. After a break of about 10 months, in June 2022, Teo asked the girl over WhatsApp if he could again send pictures of his private parts and if she remembered that he had previously spoken to her about his \"horny problems\". The girl replied to Teo that he should \"stop letting your desires control you\" and blocked him on June 13, 2022. That same month, the girl created a second Instagram account under a fake identity and contacted Teo to gather evidence on how he had been sending sexual messages to her and her friend. He knew that the person behind the Instagram account was a minor under the age of 16 and engaged in sexual communication with the account holder, but did not know that the girl was behind the account. On June 22, 2022, a police report was made stating that Teo had sent photos of his private parts to two children. Court documents did not state who made this report or how Teo was arrested. AUTISM DISORDER DIAGNOSIS Defence lawyer Harjeet Kaur on Thursday asked for probation or a combination of a short detention order and a community service order to be considered for Teo, arguing that rehabilitation should be the primary consideration in Teo’s sentencing. \"While the offences committed are in no way submitted to be trivial, they are not so egregious that rehabilitation has been totally displaced,\" she argued. Ms Kaur said that her client had been diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and autism spectrum disorder after the commission of the offences. Referring to a medical report, she said that because Teo did not have the opportunity to undergo appropriate training and education for his condition, he was unable to form relationships with persons of his own age and could only form relationships with adolescents. Ms Kaur argued that Teo’s condition would make him a “highly vulnerable” prisoner. The constant close contact with others would also “distress him severely” due to his hypersensitivity to touch. She further argued that if rehabilitation was not at the forefront and that deterrence was the dominant sentencing consideration, she would want to seek a jail term of no more than three weeks and two days for her client. DPP Arvindren sought a jail term of seven to eight weeks. He outlined factors such as the victims’ vulnerability due to their age, Teo’s position as a teacher at the student care centre and the fact that he had repeated his acts to multiple victims. In response to the defence’s arguments, DPP Arvindren emphasised that Teo had admitted to the police that he committed the offences because of his sexual desires. This was further supported by the mandatory treatment order suitability report that found no contributory link between his condition and his offences. He was also not impaired from appreciating the nature of his acts and their wrongfulness, DPP Arvindren added. District Judge Wong said in her remarks that she agreed with the prosecution that a jail term is appropriate because the charges are serious ones. “There is an abuse of trust, in that the accused in the present case is a student care teacher in the same school as these very young victims,” she added. She also took into account the multiple victims involved and the findings in the mandatory treatment order suitability report. For each count of engaging in sexual communication with a minor under the age of 14, Teo could have been jailed for up to three years or fined, or sentenced to both punishments. For distributing an obscene image, he could have been jailed not longer than three months or be fined, or both.

By Justin Ong Guang-Xi By Justin Ong Guang-Xi Published June 13, 2024 Updated June 13, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Amid grouses by the first batch of Tengah residents on the lack of amenities and transport options, Grab on Thursday (June 13) said it is mapping out the town on foot and by car as it is being constructed. This is to ensure food deliveries and passenger pick-ups can be successfully carried out, the technology firm said. Grab is undertaking this initiative because the Tengah HDB estate is designated as a “car-lite” town with fewer parking spaces, and more walking and cycling connections. To that end, Grab is ensuring that amid the network of walking paths and newly opened roads, its delivery riders and ride-hailing drivers are able to navigate the area more proficiently. “Grab is using its proprietary mapping technology to update maps with Tengah’s evolving network of roads and points of interests, to ease residents’ concerns around the difficulties of navigating roads amidst ongoing construction and finding the right pick-up and drop-off points,” said Grab in a statement on Thursday. Adviser to Hong Kah North Grassroots Organisations Amy Khor, who attended the media event announcing this initiative, said Grab’s initiative will complement efforts by government agencies to improve transport connectivity at Tengah. “Residents will benefit from this initiative that can help make deliveries and ride-hailing bookings more timely,” said Dr Khor, who is also Senior Minister of State for Transport. To map out the area visually, Grab staff have been plodding around walking paths at Tengah weekly since March, carrying backpacks mounted with camera devices. The device — the KartaCam — has a camera on each of its four sides, creating a 360-degree view of every footpath and road in the vicinity. “The KartaCam backpack enables better mapping of footpaths through green spaces, and allows detailed surveys of corridors and entrances in Tengah,” said Grab. “This is especially beneficial for delivery partners who travel on foot or on bicycles, as they can now choose the most efficient path to their destinations.” Wallace Woon/CNA A Karta camera unit, attached to a backpack, seen against blocks of HDB flats in Tengah. The bag and camera weigh approximately 6kg, and with a stand supporting it, and the camera is about 2m above ground when worn by an adult. Grab will then use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse the images to map out the area, said head of product for maps at Grab Sunny Wijewardana. “We will get the images out of the camera, and then we will extract all the information out of it, and then code that into a map that is used for all our deliveries,” he said. For instance, traffic lights and road signs will be picked up by AI and such information will be added to the map data. The information will then be used to map out points of interest, including lift lobbies, to help food delivery riders complete their deliveries. “With a new area like this, our customers may have issues finding the right drop off point, or pick up point, they might have issues with getting the right delivery coming to their house as well,” said Mr Wijewardana. “So, we want to take the initiative and we want to be proactive and resolve any of these problems before they happen.” 6 TENGAH TOWNS FULLY MAPPED Grab is also mapping out the roads of Tengah on a weekly basis by mounting the KartaCam device on a car, to ensure that its ride-hailing drivers can better locate passengers. During a car ride through Tengah, CNA found that some roads within the towns that appear on other map applications were actually still under construction and not open to the public yet. “(Tengah) is rapidly changing. Every week, there is a new road being completed, there’s a new building, new U-turns being put in, and we want to be as accurate as possible for customers,” said Grab’s managing director Yee Wee Tang. “We want to make sure that when passengers book a car, it is matched to the exact location, or else there are a lot of disputes.” Both mapping initiatives are under GrabMaps, which collects location-based services and mapping data across Southeast Asia. It was launched by Grab in 2022. Since March, Grab fully mapped six precincts in Tengah, which comprise over 10km of roads and footpaths and nearly 160 points of interest such as lift lobbies, HDB blocks and a list of businesses in Tengah's new town. As of June, these six precincts are the first to be completed, out of 22 planned HDB precincts. “Grab will map new precincts in Tengah as HDB opens them for key collection, and continue to update the maps for the existing precincts as roads and points of interests develop,” it said. In addition to the mapping exercise, Grab will provide free delivery from over 2,000 F&B outlets and grocery stores to Tengah residents from June 14 until the end of the year. The firm said this is to ensure residents have access to a wider variety of food choices while malls and restaurants open up over time. At the event, Dr Khor said that some amenities at Tengah are set to open soon. Plantation Plaza, for example, the first neighbourhood centre in Tengah, has been completed and the supermarket and food court will be the first to open later this month. One Tengah resident said that he welcomes Grab's initiative to offer free deliveries but is taking a “wait and see” approach to whether connectivity in the area will improve. Real estate consultant Loh Zhenhao said that booking ride-hailing apps out of Tengah has been “difficult”, with wait times stretching to an hour before a driver accepts his ride, even when he books on a variety of platforms. He is holding his breath on whether the mapping initiative will improve things. “It’s hypothetical to say now, because I haven't experienced it,” said the 40-year-old. “I can only tell you once I experience it.” CNA CNA editor's note: This article has been amended to correct the number of planned HDB precincts in Tengah, after Grab amended the information it initially provided.

SINGAPORE — Diesel fuel prices across most of Malaysia soared by more than 50 per cent, as the country slashed its diesel subsidies in West Malaysia on Monday (June 10) as part of a wider shift away from blanket subsidies.

The move effectively aligned diesel rates with market prices, as pumps across the peninsula shot up from RM2.15 (S$0.61) to RM3.35 (S$0.96) a litre — a 56 per cent increase. Economists told TODAY that they foresee a moderate increase in the price of goods and services in Malaysia as a result of the reforms, though the wider impact on the country’s fiscal position is still unclear. As for prices of Malaysian goods imported into Singapore via its land border, they are expecting a “minimal” impact. Explaining the move last month, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said that the cuts are part of his plan to focus aid for low-income groups in the country by restructuring its wide-ranging subsidies, which he argued had benefitted the ultra-rich since their consumption or spending on goods and services is greater. Fuel, rice and cooking oil, as well as other basic items, are heavily subsidised in Malaysia, which has seen its subsidy bill rise to record levels in recent years. The country’s diesel subsidies alone surged almost 10-fold from RM1.4 billion (S$400 million) in 2019 to RM14.3 billion (S$4.08 billion) in 2023. The diesel subsidy cuts are expected to bring about savings of RM4 billion, which will be channelled to fund public transport and cash aid, Mr Anwar said separately on Tuesday at the finance ministry’s monthly assembly. As part of a bid to restructure the country’s subsidy distribution system, the government had also announced the rationalisation of subsidies for electricity tariffs and sales of chicken last year, which are estimated to save RM4.5 billion and RM1.2 billion a year respectively. However, there are some exceptions to the removal of the diesel subsidies. In Sabah and Sarawak, where the use of diesel vehicles is widespread, the price of diesel will remain subsidised at RM2.15 a litre. Logistics vehicles under the government’s MySubsidi Diesel programme can also qualify for the subsidised diesel rate. Lower diesel prices have been set as well for fishermen and land public transport vehicles such as school buses and ambulances, the finance ministry said. IMPACT ON MALAYSIA Because of these continued subsidies under the MySubsidi Diesel scheme for commercial vehicles, Dr Cassey Lee, senior fellow and coordinator of the regional economic studies programme at Singapore's Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, expects just a “moderate increase” in the prices of goods in the country. The programme, which is targeted at logistics companies, provides the firms with fleet cards that allow them to continue buying subsidised diesel at fuel retail stations. The scheme aims to cushion some of the impact of fuel costs on supply chains and so safeguard consumers from extreme price increases. However, some increase — albeit a “moderate” one — in goods’ prices is still expected, experts said. In its monetary policy statement published on May 9, the Central Bank of Malaysia said that inflation in 2024 is expected to “remain moderate”, but the outlook for the rest of the year is dependent on the “implementation of domestic policy on subsidies and price controls”, as well as global commodity prices and financial market developments. Elaborating on this, Mr Suhaimi Ilias, chief economist at Maybank Investment Banking Group, said that the banking group expects the country’s inflation to average at 2.4 per cent this year, which is higher than the 1.7 per cent average for the first four months of the year. This implies that monthly inflation could pick up from June onwards and last for the rest of the year. On how the diesel subsidy reforms will translate to programmes for Malaysians, Dr Lee said that the reforms will “release some fiscal resources” for the federal government. The aim of redirecting what was previously spent on diesel subsidies to lower-income groups in Malaysia may also help these groups to weather inflation. It remains to be seen, though, how the overall fiscal position will change, or how significant is the aid for lower-income groups, since much depends on how the government spends the money, Dr Lee added. He noted: “For example, the Malaysian government has increased the salaries of civil servants by 13 per cent, costing RM10 billion annually. “This amount is close to savings from the diesel subsidy reforms. This suggests that the net change is near neutral from a fiscal point.” If executed well, Mr Suhaimi from Maybank said that the reforms would demonstrate the government’s political will to undertake unpopular but necessary policy reforms — especially from the perspectives of the financial market and international rating agencies. Conversely, a poor execution of the reforms could also lead to negative political implications. Dr Lee said: “If the diesel subsidy reforms result in the perception of increasing hardship and worsening economic performance, the popularity of the present government will decline. “This will also put the government on the defensive and it will have less appetite for future reforms such as the RON95 petrol subsidy reforms.” IMPACT ON SINGAPORE The experts said that they do not foresee the diesel subsidy reforms in Malaysia to affect the general prices of imported goods in Singapore significantly, but certain imported products from Malaysia might end up costing marginally more. Dr Lee of Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute expects the price increases of goods driven by trucks into Singapore to be “minimal”, reiterating that commercial vehicles can continue to buy subsidised diesel via the MySubsidi Diesel fleet card system. The move is not expected to have a “material impact” on Singapore’s overall inflation, another analyst said. Dr Chua Hak Bin, regional co-head of macro research at Maybank Investment Banking Group, noted however, that there may still be second-order effects on the prices of certain goods here. Some food items transported from Malaysia may see a small increase in prices, for example. However, as a contributory factor to food prices in Singapore,Dr Chua said that the cost of fuel used during transportation is not as significant compared to the overall costs of labour and vehicles, as well as taxes. As labour and rentals account for a big proportion of overall costs for food-serving services, the impact of the extra cost of transport on overall menu prices in Singapore will likely be small, he added.

The move is aimed at helping the public identify authentic government SMSes and to guard against government official impersonation scams, said Smart Nation Group, Open Government Products (OGP) and the Ministry of Communications and Information in a joint media release on Thursday (June 13). Since January, at least 126 people have been cheated by scammers impersonating Chinese officials, with total losses amounting to at least S$16.3 million, according to an advisory by the police on Thursday. In the past, scammers have also impersonated police officers to convince victims to provide their personal details or transfer their money to third-party bank accounts. In the joint release on Thursday, the agencies said that SMS remains a key platform for government communications to the public, given the widespread use of mobile phones. More than 100 million SMSes are sent by various government agencies annually to notify recipients about policy changes and provide transaction updates, they added. WHAT TO EXPECT Recipients can expect SMSes from gov.sg for updates from various government agencies such as the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board, Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Immigration and Checkpoints Authority. The type of messages the public may receive includes updates on personal CPF matters, transaction status and appointment details, HDB flat and loan eligibility, as well as reminders to renew identity cards and passports. However, some exceptions will be made for SMSes on National Service (NS) matters and emergency services. For example, messages on NS call-ups, training as well as mobilisation will be sent by the number \"72255\". Likewise, those who contact the police helpline will receive SMSes from \"71000\" for information on accessing the services they require. The single sender ID will be progressively rolled out from June 18. During this period until the complete roll-out on July 1, government agencies, ministries and statutory boards will continue to send SMSes from their respective sender IDs. Members of the public are advised to remain vigilant against scams while checking messages for the official gov.sg sender ID. The consolidated sender ID is designed to give the public \"added confidence and ease of mind\" when identifying legitimate SMSes from government agencies, said deputy secretary of Smart Nation Group Sim Feng-Ji. Speaking to the media, Mr Sim said the agency is working closely with SMS aggregators — platforms or services that help to send bulk messages — telecommunication service providers and their sub-brands to ensure that messages that are not from the government cannot use the gov.sg sender ID. Mr Hygin Fernandez, policy assistant director of OGP, told CNA that additional safeguards are also in place for the gov.sg sender ID. \"If anyone were to try and register a sender ID that looks even remotely like gov.sg, there are multiple layers (of protection), including a manual one where somebody eyeballs it, that prevents that message from ever being reaching the public,\" he said. Mr Hygin added that it took about nine months to plan and develop the sender ID. The main focus when designing was to make sure the average person on the street would understand what the new way of communication means for them, said the policy assistant director. He added: \"We've been very grateful for all the support that we've got across different agencies to come onboard… Everybody getting onto one system is not necessarily straightforward. \"All the agencies have different needs and we need to support (them) all.\" CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

Published June 13, 2024 Updated June 13, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — A Singapore diplomat was fined 300,000 yen (S$2,580) on Thursday (June 13) by a court in Japan after filming a naked boy in a public bath in Tokyo, Kyodo news agency reported. The 55-year-old man, identified as Sim Siong Chye by Japanese broadcaster NHK, was indicted on charges of trespassing and violating the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Anti-Nuisance Ordinance. Earlier on Thursday, Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) told CNA that the officer did not have diplomatic immunity because his posting had ended as scheduled in mid-April this year. The man was a former counsellor at the Singapore Embassy in Tokyo. A counsellor is a diplomatic rank for officers serving overseas, such as in an embassy. According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, a diplomat cannot be arrested. Japanese media reported on Thursday that the man has returned to Japan for questioning by the police. He arrived in Japan on June 9 following a request made by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department through Japan’s Foreign Ministry, reported the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. MFA said the officer \"chose to return to Japan to cooperate with investigations\" upon request by the Japanese authorities. \"The Singapore Embassy in Tokyo has engaged with the Japanese authorities to facilitate the ongoing investigations. We should wait for the outcome of these investigations,\" added the ministry. Japanese media reported in February that the diplomat had used his mobile phone to secretly film a 13-year-old first-year middle school student in the changing room of a public bath. The boy was naked. The police were called and \"multiple naked photos of male customers\" were found on his phone, according to Asahi at that time. It added that the diplomat refused to go to the police station but told officers he had taken such photos in other public baths. MFA said previously that the diplomat had completed his tour of duty in Tokyo as scheduled and returned to Singapore. It was made aware of the allegations on May 1 after it was contacted by Japanese media outlets. The diplomat did not inform the ministry of the incident until he was asked about it. He was then suspended from duties, with MFA saying on May 2 that it would be prepared to waive diplomatic immunity to facilitate investigations “if the alleged facts bear out”.

A TikTok video showing a woman aged about 100 years old working at a provision shop went viral An appeal was made to encourage people to support her business at Beauty World Centre in Upper Bukit Timah It was later discovered that her family owns a goldsmith shop in the same shopping centre The woman was working because her son did not want her to be alone at home and she would have something to do to while away the time By Kong Kit Yan By Kong Kit Yan Published June 13, 2024 Updated June 14, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — A 102-year-old woman selling snacks, toiletries, toys, socks and other peripheral items at Beauty World Centre has gone viral on TikTok, after someone filmed her at a shop and asked the public to support her business. It turned out that making money was not top of her mind because she kept giving away extra items or even refusing payment. The shop, Lean Seng Lee Trading, is helmed by Madam Sie Choo Yong. Her age was confirmed by her family members who spoke to TODAY. The family also owns Lean Seng Lee Goldsmith, which is located just one floor above the provision shop at the shopping centre in Upper Bukit Timah. TikTok user \"dinahnahnah\" said in the video posted on Wednesday (June 12) that Mdm Sie gave her more lollipops even though she paid S$2 for two. She also seemingly charged a lower price for several items bought later by the TikTok user's husband. They could not understand what she said and when they recalculated and gave her S$20, telling her to keep the change, she refused and kept shoving more snacks in their bag. A passerby who helped to bridge the communication for Mdm Sie then told of the woman's grand age and encouraged the couple to patronise her shop more often. The video has been viewed more than 97,500 times and had 10,400 likes as of Thursday evening. As TODAY found out on visiting the provision shop, it belongs to Mdm Sie's youngest son and she is just helping to manage the store because staying at home is \"boring\", her son said. Due to her age, her voice was no longer clear and her speech not so coherent, but she energetically gestured with her hands her age when asked. She has seven children and 27 grandchildren. The provision shop was initially located at the old Beauty World — a market and shopping venue in the 1960s — and moved to its current location in 1984. It is just one of the businesses that her family runs. Mdm Sie's youngest son, who did not want to be identified, said that he chose to keep the store open for his mother so that she could do simple tasks and would not be alone and bored at home. He has no plans to hand over or sell the store for now. Mdm Sie hopes to keep running the store until she is no longer physically able to do so. Her second oldest son Lean Kee Suh, 66, who works at a Cold Storage supermarket in Bukit Batok, said in Mandarin that Mdm Sie emigrated from China in her 30s. He also said that she used to work long hours as a farmer in China. \"She worked from day to night, lifting bags that were up to 60kg.\" Even now, she is highly mobile for her age, standing up to attend to each customer and taking occasional breaks by sitting on a chair outside her store. She also lifted a bundle of newspapers, neatly arranging each copy. Mr Lean mentioned that his mother is extremely healthy, requiring no medication and rarely visiting the hospital. \"She is healthier than me,\" he said, adding that he was diagnosed with diabetes. \"This store does not make a profit, it is just for her to pass time. We would make more money renting it.\" Each day, Mdm Sie arrives at the shopping centre at 8am, she has her breakfast nearby and opens the store at around 9am. One of the neighbouring store owners, Mr Tay Kok Yih, 63, spoke of how mobile Mdm Sie was for her age and questioned lightheartedly: \"Is she really 102 years old?\" Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Madam Sie Choo Yong attending to a customer at her son's shop in Beauty World Centre on June 13, 2024. Just as she did in the TikTok video, when TODAY was at the shop, Mdm Sie was seen giving extra snacks to a child who bought from her. She also refused to accept payment when TODAY bought some biscuits, so the money was left at a counter. Most people who viewed the TikTok video looked kindly upon her, calling her \"a gem\" and \"sweet\", with some making promises to patronise her shop. One TikTok user wrote: \"Yes, please support this aunty. I grew up buying snacks from her shop since primary school. I’m hitting 30 and till this day she remembers me.\" Another wrote: \"I always drop by on Thursdays to buy something from them, she's always happy whenever someone patronises her store.\" One comment read: \"Thanks for sharing! I live just one stop away but never knew about this shop... Will definitely pay her a visit and support her.\" @dinahnahnah Nearest mrt is Beauty world mrt, downtown line.

On at least one occasion, he repeatedly hit the boy with a rubber hose because the boy had angered him by texting his wife, from whom the man had divorced. On Friday (June 14), the 53-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to two years’ jail after pleading guilty to three counts of ill-treating a child under his care. A charge of criminal intimidation was taken into consideration during the sentencing. The parties involved cannot be named under a court order to protect the victim's identity. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that at the time of the offences, the man had custody of his biological son after a divorce with his wife. On Nov 30, 2022, the man learnt that his son, had been texting his mother despite being told to cut off contact. He became angry and slapped the boy on the left side of his face, causing injury and pain in the victim’s left ear. He then used a yellow rubber hose to hit the victim on the upper left arm, back and left thigh, causing multiple bruises. The boy was taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital to treat his injuries. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Jocelyn Teo said that the offender also admitted that he had hit the victim on previous occasions. Investigations revealed that at least three times in 2022, the man also secured the boy’s ankle or wrist to a fixed metal bar in the toilet, using a metal chain and padlock. He would put a rubber hose between the metal chain and the victim’s skin to protect him from injury if he struggled, and put some food and water in the toilet, leaving the victim there for two to five hours. The man would either sleep or leave home, exposing him to potential danger in case of emergency such as a fire, the prosecution said in its sentencing submissions. DPP Teo said: “The accused did so to punish the victim for lying, not doing his homework or not keeping his promise such as not to contact his mother.” Police were alerted to the child abuse case by a staff member working with the National Anti-Violence Helpline on Dec 4, 2022. Court documents did not indicate which incident led to the police report. Seeking a jail term of between 28 and 31 months, the prosecution pointed to the “extensive” injuries suffered by the child and the abuse of position of trust on the part of the father as aggravating factors. Defence counsel Mansur Husain sought a shorter jail term of between 12 and 15 months, describing the term sought by the prosecution as “excessive”. He said that his client is apologetic for his mistakes and pleaded for leniency so that he could put this chapter of his life behind him as soon as possible. In delivering his decision, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt described the punishments in the case as “harmful and completely unnecessary”. He added that the defence had also conceded that the offender had crossed the line between disciplining a child and committing these criminal acts. For each count of ill-treating a child, the man could have been jailed for up to eight years or fined up to S$8,000, or both.

Published June 14, 2024 Updated June 14, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn PUTRAJAYA — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim clarified on Friday (June 14) that the government will not be employing English teachers from Singapore for Malaysian schools. Instead, he explained that what he had suggested to Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong during their meeting earlier in the week was for teachers in the city state to teach English to disadvantaged children in poor and rural areas. Mr Anwar added that the scheme would be voluntary and fully funded by the Singaporean government. “Bahasa Malaysia is the language of instruction and the official language,” Mr Anwar said at an event held at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre “But we want to emphasise English, so I asked if there was a scheme from Singapore to help. “We are not appointing teachers from Singapore. Listen first. Some are bashing this on social media, but the facts are wrong. “What I discussed with the prime minister of Singapore is to organise an aid scheme, or to appoint volunteers who are paid by the Singaporean government to go to areas, especially in poor urban and rural areas, to teach English.” Mr Anwar said that it is his mission to build good rapport with neighbouring countries. “I want to build good relations between countries. We want to be good with Thailand, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, our important neighbours,” he said. “During our discussion, we talked about the Johor economic zone, along with investment and trade, and I suggested using the initiative to build good relations, by encouraging graduates from Singapore to participate in a volunteer scheme teaching English in Malaysia. That’s our recommendation.” Mr Anwar met with Singapore PM Wong on Wednesday during the latter’s two-day working visit to Malaysia. Among the topics discussed was the possibility of sending Singaporean teachers to Malaysia. Presently, Johor and Singapore are already working on a joint education project with a new curriculum that involves the exchange of programmes and teacher training.

A TikTok user has gone viral for a video that shows him buying energy drinks for foreign workers He said that he gains a sense of fulfilment from helping others Both the workers and the video's viewers thanked him for his act of kindness and some were inspired to do the same By Kong Kit Yan By Kong Kit Yan Published June 14, 2024 Updated June 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — A TikToker has gone viral for buying energy drinks for foreign workers in an act of kindness that he said makes his life more fulfilling. In a post on Thursday (June 13), TikTok user \"SomethingForSomeone\" shared a video of himself buying Red Bull and 100plus drinks for construction workers. When TODAY reached out to him, he declined to reveal his real name, but said that he was aged 24 and self-employed. In the video, he approaches some workers outside Khatib MRT Station after overhearing them talk about buying drinks. He asks how many people there were, before he heads to a nearby Giant supermarket to buy the drinks. \"Don't run away!\" he advises them. After giving each of the workers a drink, winning a hearty round of thanks, he later returns with more, asking them to give them to their driver or other workers. He wrote: \"Just imagine if you inspire one person and this person inspires another and the cycle continues.\" He added: \"Lastly, don't forget to do something for someone.\" The video has garnered more than 77,300 views and 4,000 likes as of Friday afternoon. In an earlier video, he gives out about 30 cans of Red Bull to workers who are maintaining public areas and thanks them for their hard work. Other videos on his TikTok account also show him buying food and drinks for strangers. Speaking to TODAY, he said that he had been doing this since early last month. \"I felt that something was always missing in my life. My heart felt empty.\" He said that he had always enjoyed helping others and hopes to inspire people, especially the young, to regain the \"kampung spirit\" — referring to the spirit of neighbourliness that existed among communal households in the days before people started living in high-rise housing. There is no specific location that he sticks to and he performs his good deeds in his free time or whenever he runs into people who needs help. He is not funded by any organisation, he said. \"I have support from the general public who believe in my cause.\" His efforts have won the hearts of many who thanked him in the comments below the video. One TikTok user wrote: \"Good job. Thank you.\" Another wrote: \"Thank you for doing this.\" His actions have also inspired some to do the same. One TikTok user said: \"I am going to do this with my girls this weekend.\" Another comment read: \"Me and my kids always waiting for your content.

Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. David Chua came up with different ways to cheat money from various victims because he needed to repay gambling debts The victims included customers at his workplace as well as Carousell users He cheated one victim of close to S$125,000 promising investment opportunities and also asked the victim to lend him S$40,000 Chua was sentenced to 21 months' jail for his offences By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 14, 2024 Updated June 14, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Between 2019 and 2023, David Chua cheated customers of a travel agency where he worked and strangers on Carousell to fund his gambling habit. In all, he had taken in excess of S$160,000 from the various victims, including from one victim he cheated with “persistence” 25 times. On Friday (June 14), the 36-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to 21 months’ jail after pleading guilty to two charges of cheating and one of criminal breach of trust. Two other charges were taken into consideration for sentencing while one was discharged amounting to an acquittal. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that between September and October 2019, while Chua was working at Holiday Tour & Travel as a travel consultant, he asked six customers to make payment for their tour packages directly to him instead of the company. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Ryan Lim said: “On at least two of those occasions, he told the customer that he would be able to provide discounts if they did so.” By the end of October that year, he had misappropriated the money — amounting to S$22,400 — and used it to repay his gambling debts. The company conducted internal investigations after a customer notified them that he did not receive the promised vouchers and travel itinerary. Chua's employment was terminated on Oct 31 and the company made a police report the next day. Between Aug 13 and Oct 23 in 2022, he cheated five people of at least S$20,830 through online marketplace Carousell by promising to sell them tickets to an e-gaming tournament. The buyers never got the tickets. Court documents did not state whether or not Chua had such tickets to offer in the first place. Of the five victims he fleeced, he made full restitution of S$900 to three of them and made none to two others, including one from whom he cheated S$17,260. Sometime in or before August 2022, Chua became acquainted with a sixth victim who saw an advertisement he put up on Carousell. Between August and October that year, the male victim transferred about S$36,740 to him, after Chua offered various purported investment opportunities. Around December that year, Chua told this sixth victim that the trading account used for one of the victim’s investments had been frozen. He instructed the victim to get in touch with his supposed friend and broker named \"Khun Nai\" for assistance. Khun Nai was Chua himself. On 25 occasions between Dec 17, 2022 and Jan 31, 2023, Chua who was posing as Khun Nai instructed the victim to transfer various sums of money, said to be for purposes of withdrawing his investment capital. In reality, the money was transferred into Chua’s bank account or his accounts on gambling websites. On each occasion, the victim transferred anything between S$500 and about S$7,625, totalling almost S$87,700. This excludes the roughly S$36,740 cheated from the victim between August and October 2022, and another excess of S$40,000 in personal loan that Chua borrowed from the victim. The victim eventually filed a police report on Feb 4, 2023. Chua has repaid the victim S$10,500. Seeking between 21 and 24 months’ imprisonment, DPP Lim highlighted how for the first offence, Chua had betrayed both the trust of his employer and his customers, and made no restitutions to the parties. He then exploited online platform Carousell to reach a “wider pool of potential victims” when carrying out his ticket-selling scam. In regards to the last victim, DPP Lim said: “The accused displayed persistence in extracting monies from the victim, cheating him on 25 occasions”. DPP Lim also noted how Chua displayed a level of planning by posing as a broker and coming up with a ploy to trick the victim into parting with even more money. For each count of cheating, Chua could have been sentenced to 10 years’ jail and fined. For criminal breach of trust, he could have been jailed up to 15 years and been liable to a fine.

These drains convey and discharge stormwater to the sea and are not linked to our reservoirs,” said PUB. Cleaning and containment efforts have been underway since the incident on Friday afternoon, when a dredger hit a bunker vessel at Pasir Panjang Terminal. Oil started washing up on Saturday along the coast of several beaches in Singapore, including those on Sentosa island and in East Coast Park, staining the sand black and sending the stench of petrochemicals into the air. PUB said no oil has been detected near the seawater intake at Jurong Island Desalination Plant, which is closest to the oil spill location. “Water quality readings remain normal. The Marina East Desalination Plant, located further along the coast, has a dual-mode capability with the flexibility to treat either seawater or reservoir water. It is currently in ‘reservoir’ mode and treating water from the Marina Reservoir,” said the agency. “We will continue to monitor seawater quality closely to ensure operations are not impacted.” Nuria Ling/TODAY A clean-up operation taking place at East Coast Park on June 18, 2024.

Nuria Ling/TODAY Oil seen on the beaches of East Coast Park on June 18, 2024. BIODIVERSITY-SENSITIVE AREAS The authorities said in a separate joint statement on Monday evening that the next phase of clean-up operations has commenced, involving the additional deployment of various booms and oil recovery systems. About 1,500m of booms have already been deployed, with plans to send out another 1,600m over the next few days. These will be placed at designated sites to support the containment of accumulated oil to facilitate the clean-up operation off the beaches and shorelines, said the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA), National Environment Agency (NEA), National Parks Board (NParks), Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and PUB. The authorities also noted that some of the oil was seen off Changi on Monday. Additional booms will be installed as a preventive measure off Changi East. A Current Buster system, a vessel-deployed specialised oil floating containment and recovery device, will also be deployed on Tuesday off the Changi Exhibition Centre as a \"pre-emptive measure\". The Current Buster consists of a boom with a skirt that extends into the water to corral and collect the oil on the surface. It is capable of accumulating up to five tonnes of oil in one craft-load before discharging. AIR QUALITY The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been conducting daily air quality tests at affected areas along Sentosa, East Coast Park and Labrador Nature Reserve since Saturday. This is to ensure the safety of the public and personnel involved in the clean-up operations, said the authorities. The daily test includes measuring levels of volatile organic compounds that are commonly associated with bunkering fuels and other petrochemicals. This includes benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene. “Thus far, the air quality at the affected areas is well within safe levels. In addition, NEA monitors ambient levels of volatile organic compounds at various locations in Singapore and no anomalies have been detected.” As a precaution, the authorities advised members of the public against swimming at Changi beach and engaging in other “primary contact water activities” until further notice. Such an advisory is already in place at Pasir Ris and Sembawang beaches due to elevated bacteria count. CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

On Tuesday (June 18), the offender, now 18 , was sentenced to two years' probation with various strict conditions, including one year at Singapore Boys' Hostel. He must also serve 100 hours of community service. The teen pleaded guilty in April to one count each of rioting with a deadly weapon and criminal intimidation, with one charge of fighting in a public place taken into consideration for sentencing. All parties cannot be named as they were under 18 years of age at the time of the offences. WHAT HAPPENED According to court documents, the offender met up with four male friends sometime in March 2023 and told them he wanted to beat up the victim as the victim had been harassing his female friend. They agreed to accompany him. The teen messaged the victim, then 16, using his female friend’s Instagram account to meet at a multi-storey car park toilet in Bukit Batok for sex on March 20. The victim agreed. When the victim arrived and knocked on the toilet door, the offender opened the door and pulled him in. His four friends who were nearby, followed the victim in. The offender held a parang on the victim’s neck, threatening to cut him. While smoking, he ordered the victim to strip naked and threatened to slash him with the weapon if the victim was not naked before he finished his cigarette. “The victim obeyed as he was scared,” said Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Pavithra Ramkumar. After the victim stripped himself, the offender asked him to kneel before physically assaulting him. He then asked the victim to apologise to his friend. The offender later passed the victim a bottle which his two friends had urinated into, and forced the victim to drink its entire content. The victim was later assaulted by one of the offender’s friends. The offender and his friends filmed the victim at various points of the ordeal. The offender then ordered the victim to wear his clothes and allowed him to leave, but warned him that he would attack him again if he reported the incident to the police. At about 9.20pm the same day, the victim returned home. His father noticed his injuries and took him to National University Hospital the next day and later made a police report. The offender was identified via police camera footage and arrested on March 22. Two of the offender’s friends who were involved in the incident have been sentenced to probation, while the cases for the remaining two are still pending. Along with the probation, the offender's mother is required to lodge a S$5,000 good behaviour bond on her son's behalf. Four months after his discharge from the hostel, the teen is to attend a violence prevention programme. Addressing the offender's mother in court on Tuesday, the judge advised her to give her son a lot of encouragement and support as he serves his sentence. For rioting with a deadly weapon, the teen could have been jailed for up to 10 years and caned. For criminal intimidation, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, or both.

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had directed ELD to revise the voter rolls and complete the revision by July 31, the department previously announced a month ago on May 20. The revised registers contain the names of all qualified electors as of June 1. Singaporeans are able to check their particulars in the registers on the ELD website or on the Singpass application. People who are unable to check their particulars online can do so at community centres and ServiceSG centres near their homes. They can also do so at the ELD office by making an appointment online or calling 1800-225-5353. Singaporeans who are overseas and unable to check their particulars online may do so at Singapore overseas missions serving as overseas registration centres. During the inspection period, Singaporeans may submit a claim to include their names if it has been omitted, or update their particulars if it is reflected differently from their NRICs, said ELD. An objection may also be submitted to remove a name from the register for the electoral division that they are in. Claims and objections may be submitted online on ELD's website, or in person at community centres, the ELD office, and Singapore overseas missions serving as registration centres. A list of claims will subsequently be made available for inspection from July 13 to July 20 at those locations. Those with their names removed from the registers for failing to vote in a past election may apply on ELD's website to have their names restored so they can vote in future elections, it said, adding that they are encouraged to apply early. \"Under the law, we will not be able to restore their names during the period from the date the Writ for an election is issued until after Nomination Day if the election is not contested, or until after Polling Day if a poll is to be taken,\" said ELD. \"Consequently, they will not be able to cast their vote if a poll is to be taken for the Electoral Division that they are residing in.\" Singapore's last General Election was on July 10, 2020, and the next one must be held by November 2025. Political analysts had cited September this year as a potential slot. On June 12, PM Wong implied that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) had not yet been formed when reporters asked him about the timing of the election. Convening the EBRC is a necessary step before calling a General Election. CNA has asked ELD for an update on the EBRC. CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

A Singapore Redditor has gone online to seek views on his girlfriend’s offer to help pay for the engagement ring of her dreams The man said the woman earns twice his income and wanted a ring that’s about S$7,000 above his budget but expressed some misgivings about accepting the offer Most commenters said the girlfriend’s offer is a “ major green flag”, that is, a positive sign of her character and approach to the relationship Most also agreed that it is fine to accept the girlfriend’s offer, given she would be wearing the ring, adding that it is important that she finds something she likes Still, some others questioned if the man’s caution over the offer is because of a hurt ego and an old-fashioned view of the man’s obligations By Deborah Lau By Deborah Lau Published June 18, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Is it a green or red flag if a woman offers to help cover the cost of her pricey engagement ring? Reddit user “No-Swan-3807” took to the online forum in a r/SingaporeRaw thread on Monday (June 17) to seek netizens’ advice on whether his girlfriend’s offer is acceptable. The Redditor said in his post that he plans to propose to his girlfriend, who has been “very involved” in the process and “knows exactly the kind of (engagement) ring that she wants”. He added, however, that he is able to afford only something “more modest than what she’d like”. As the ring of her dreams costs about S$7,000 more than his budget, his girlfriend has offered to chip in to cover the additional cost of the engagement ring. Still, the Redditor said that he feels “weird” and “bad” about going ahead with her suggestion, as he has not heard of anyone else doing the same. This prompted him to seek advice on the forum on whether he should accept her offer, or instead go ahead to “splurge” on the ring without accepting his girlfriend’s help. He added that his girlfriend earns twice as much as he does, which is why she thinks it is fine that she chips in – especially as the ring is “something that she insists that she wants, (and is not) a need”. Replying to comments in the thread, the Redditor explained that he works in healthcare and his girlfriend works in finance, and that she would “always earn much more than (he does), at least in the foreseeable future”. The post sparked a lively discussion, with more than 80 comments as of Tuesday evening. ‘MULTIPLE GREEN FLAGS’ The majority of comments have lauded the Redditor’s girlfriend and regard her offer as a “major green flag” – indicating they think it’s a positive sign about the woman’s character and her approach to the relationship. Reddit user “confused_cereal” said: “Multiple green flags here: Offering to chip in, understanding differences between wants and needs, recognising your financial situation, being able to vocalise her wants.” Many have also called the girlfriend a “gem” and a “keeper”, with user “EastBeasteats” congratulating the Redditor for finding someone who is “marrying (him) for who you are, not your money”. Most users also agreed that it was fine to accept the girlfriend’s offer, given she would be the one wearing the ring and it is important that she finds something she likes. They added that he could make up for it or express his gratitude in other non-monetary ways. Redditor “xDraGonSaInTx” said: “I think I would let her chip in since it’d ultimately (be) her wearing it. However, I’ll make it a point to make it up to her in the future with other surprises without her needing to hint me that she chipped in. Sorta like a love upgrade.” Still, others were not so sure about accepting the girlfriend’s offer for various reasons. One user “Boring97979616”, for example, thinks it would be more meaningful for the Redditor to splurge on the ring given it is a special occasion, and to communicate to his girlfriend that she was worth the oversized price tag of the ring. The user said that as his girlfriend earns twice what he does, then presumably she has paid more than him for other expenses over the course of the relationship. “If that’s the case, I would say just splurge on it and spoil her at least for this occasion – you get to only buy her one ring in this lifetime. Besides, based on what you’ve posted, she seems to be worth the splurge.” Other commenters suggested that the Redditor decline her offer, lest his acceptance form the basis for arguments down the road. Beyond the mere cost of the ring, however, the post has also sparked discussions on what equality in a relationship looks like – with some Redditors questioning the original poster’s concerns about accepting his girlfriend’s offer. User “Prestigious-Toe8622” asked: “Sorry what’s the problem (here)? Her actions or your ego?” User “Slicelka” added: “At this age there is no such thing as the ‘man of the house’, accept that you both are equals, no one need to contributing more financially or effort because of gender, both have to do your part.” Agreeing, Redditor “INSYNC0” said: “Probably need to learn to embrace equality in this modern society. You feel bad because you have been drilled a mindset that the man is the one to propose, and to buy the engagement ring to surprise the woman. “With your wife earning twice of you, there will be many more things to come whereby it'll make more sense if she paid more than your share. This can be a first step. A relationship should function on mutual understanding and acceptance. If she is willing to do it for the sake of her happiness, why not?” Regardless of what users think about the offer, most, if not all, have congratulated him for finding someone who is a “green flag”, and agree that he should be quick to “put a ring on it”. TODAY has reached out to the original poster for comment.

By Ang Hwee Min By Ang Hwee Min Published June 18, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE – Singapore's 15-year-olds came out top in an international benchmarking study on creative thinking, even though they do not think of themselves as creative. Singapore students were tested on how well they generate creative ideas, as well as evaluate and improve on them in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) 2022. A total of 6,600 students from 149 secondary schools and 15 private schools, including international schools and religious schools, participated in the study, said the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a press release on Tuesday (June 18). Singapore also topped the scoreboard for mathematics, science and reading. Since 2012, Pisa has included an optional innovative domain in each testing cycle, such as creative problem solving, collaborative problem solving and global competence. Singapore ranked joint-first with Korea for creative problem solving, and first for the other two. Singapore participated in the creative thinking study because it is an \"important competency\" that helps to prepare young people for a rapidly evolving world, said MOE, adding that it was interested in having insights on how students have developed in this area. The findings are useful in improving the curriculum and training teachers to better nurture creative thinking in students, said the ministry's deputy director-general of education Sng Chern Wei. \"We certainly will be analysing the findings, and allowing us to learn from these findings the areas for further improvement, as well as areas of strength that we ought to affirm and preserve, despite the regular changes to our curriculum,\" he added. For example, to nurture creative students, they need to be given more space to experience unstructured activities and more exposure to aspects that allow them to come up with different ideas, said Mr Sng. MOE will take these into account during its curriculum reviews, he added. SMALLEST PROPORTION OF LOW PERFORMERS Students were presented with tasks that measure their ability to generate diverse ideas, generate creative ideas, as well as evaluate and improve ideas. This type of creativity can be developed through practice and is demonstrated in everyday contexts, MOE said. For example, in one exercise, students were presented with a book cover with the number \"2983\" on it, and were tasked to come up with an original story idea for the book. Conventional answers include an account of what life is like for humans in the year 2983, while an unconventional reference to the number \"2983\" in the story could be a more original idea. Participants were awarded full credits for uncommon ideas, and partial or no credits for common and conventional ideas. Singapore students ranked first in generating diverse ideas and generating creative ideas. They came second, behind Korea, in evaluating and improving ideas. Students were assigned to a proficiency level based on their results, with levels three and four, or a creative thinking score of 23 to 41, marking baseline performance. Those who scored below 23 points were regarded as low performers, while those who scored 41 and above were regarded as top performers, at proficiency levels five or six. About 58 per cent of Singapore students were top performers, attaining proficiency levels five or six. This is more than twice the OECD average proportion of 27 per cent, and the highest among all 64 participating systems, said MOE. The mean score in Singapore is 41, above the OECD average of 33. Singapore also had the smallest proportion of low performers at 6 per cent, below the OECD average of 22 per cent. Students from lower-socioeconomic status households also performed better than the average OECD student, with 36 points on average. Students in the top 25 per cent of households scored an average of 45 points. In most of the countries that participated in the study, girls performed better than boys on average, and Singapore was no different, although they were comparable in some aspects, said MOE. Girls scored an average of 42 points while boys scored an average of 40 points. Girls also outperformed boys in generating creative ideas, as well as evaluating and improving ideas. LESS CONFIDENCE IN BEING CREATIVE Despite performing well in the study, Singapore students did not think of themselves as creative. Just 64 per cent of them said they were confident or very confident of being creative, compared with the OECD average of 73 per cent. About 47 per cent of them said they were confident or very confident in telling creative stories, and 42 per cent of them thought they could produce good drawings, compared with the OECD average of 61 and 55 per cent. MOE noted that the conventional impression of Singapore students is that they are not creative and only book smart, and that this Pisa study was an instrument that could test this assumption. The outcomes are reassuring, and indicate that Singapore schools are not as uncreative as typical impressions of them would suggest, said the ministry, adding that it was \"surprised but not entirely shocked\" by the results. The Pisa results in the past 20 years can also debunk the notion that Singapore students are rote learners who cannot apply their knowledge, MOE added. \"A rote learner would not be able to perform in the Pisa main instruments so strongly cycle after cycle,\" it said. The study is a \"very affirming indication\" that Singapore students can think creatively to thrive in the future, which will demand more innovation and adaptability, said Mr Sng. Singapore students also reported favourable perceptions of their teachers’ pedagogies, which helped in nurturing their creativity, the Education Ministry said. The majority – 80 per cent – said their teachers valued creativity and encouraged students to come up with original answers. Students also reported positive family environments that fostered creative thinking. For example, 84 per cent of Singapore students noted that their family encouraged them to try new things. Schools and parents can work together to help increase students' confidence in their creative abilities, he added. Students may lack confidence because they have not received clear feedback on this aspect of their growth, since there are \"very few\" instruments that test creative thinking, Mr Sng said. \"Another possible reason may be that they are generally humble... and therefore don't rate themselves very highly when asked for their ability in creative thinking.\" CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

A man who was drinking with his friend became involved in a \"commotion\" near Boat Quay in the wee hours When police officers arrived at the scene, the man punched one of them in the head The officer lost consciousness and suffered temporary memory loss for a few days On Tuesday (June 18) the man, Devesh Raj Rajasegaran, was sentenced to five weeks' jail By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 18, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — While in a drunken stupor in the wee hours, a man punched a police officer who had been called to attend a squabble near Boat Quay involving about 10 men. The single punch was so powerful that it knocked the officer unconscious “for at least a minute” and caused him to suffer from temporary memory loss. On Tuesday (June 18), the man, Devesh Raj Rajasegaran, 24, was sentenced to five weeks’ jail. He had pleaded guilty in March this year to one count of voluntarily causing hurt. His defence counsel said on Tuesday that he will be appealing against the sentence. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that the victim was one of four police officers dispatched to an area in Circular Road on June 25, 2022 after a member of the public informed them at around 3am of “more than 10 people having an argument”. Prior to this, Devesh and his friend, Eeshwar Ravi, were drinking alcohol nearby. When the police arrived, they spotted a group of individuals including Devesh and Eeshwar involved in a \"commotion\" in Circular Road opposite BK Eating House. The officers, who were wearing civilian clothes at the time, approached the group, identifying themselves as police officers. Three of them were volunteer police officers. While the victim and another officer were interviewing a member of the group, Devesh approached them to confront the individual who was being interviewed. Soon after, Devesh threw a punch, hitting the police officer on the left side of his head. Deputy Public Prosecutor Brian Tan said in court documents: “The accused was intoxicated when he punched the victim. As a result of the accused’s punch, the victim lost consciousness for at least a minute.” The officer was later taken to the Singapore General Hospital by ambulance. Between the time he was punched and when he reached the hospital, he drifted in and out of consciousness several times. The victim was given seven days’ hospitalisation leave and reported suffering temporary loss of memory and bad headaches for at least three days after the incident. For voluntarily causing hurt, Devesh could have been jailed for up to three years, ordered to pay a fine of up to S$5,000 or both.

The employer, Wu Xiaoling, also known as Nur Nadhrah, ended up accumulating almost S$24,000 in arrears of wages to her maid. She later paid her, but only about half the amount. On Tuesday (June 18) Wu, 38, was handed a S$10,000 fine after pleading guilty to two amalgamated charges of not paying the helper her salary no later than seven days after it was due. Four other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that the domestic helper, Tumpik Astuik, had worked for Wu since Dec 4, 2018. Wu had agreed to pay Tumpik a monthly salary of S$670 on the 29th of each month. The amount was raised to S$680 after the maid’s work permit was renewed on Aug 15, 2020. The Employment of Foreign Manpower Act requires an employer to pay a helper her salary no later than seven days after it is due. Sometime in June 2019, Tumpik asked Wu to “safekeep her monthly salaries in full”. “They entered into a safekeeping arrangement whereby the accused would safekeep Tumpik’s salary until the end of Tumpik’s employment,” said manpower ministry prosecutor Jasmine Koh. Tumpik made a complaint to the Ministry of Manpower sometime in March 2022 via the migrant domestic worker helpline that her employer had not been paying her wages. She stopped working for Wu on June 7. The prosecutor did not say why the helper had entered into the arrangement in the first place, what led to the eventual complaint or why she decided to stop working for Wu on that date. According to the prosecutor, the total salary “safekept” by the employer was S$23,848.08. Wu paid Tumpik on June 5, but only S$11,750. The employer subsequently paid off the amount owed after investigations against her commenced. Seeking a total fine of between S$12,000 and S$14,000, Ms Koh pointed to the duration of the offences as well as the amount owed to the maid over the long period. Wu’s defence council pleaded for the court’s leniency, saying that she had owed Tumpik the wages as her income was hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He added that she initially wanted to let go of the maid, but did not want to leave the migrant worker in “double jeopardy” of not being employed and having to bear the costs of staying in Singapore. He added that Wu has also made restitution to Tumpik since then. For each count of not paying the helper's salary no later than seven days after it was due, Wu could have been jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$10,000, or both.

Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. By Natasha Ganesan By Natasha Ganesan Published June 19, 2024 Updated June 19, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — The overall recycling rate in Singapore has declined from 62 per cent to 52 per cent over the last decade, according to the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) latest statistics on waste and recycling. In particular, paper recycling dropped from more than 50 per cent in 2013 to 31 per cent in 2023. This is largely due to structural factors such as freight costs and commodity prices, the agency said in a media release on Wednesday (June 19). In 2023, about 6.86 million tonnes of solid waste were generated, of which 3.55 million tonnes were recycled. This amounts to an overall recycling rate of 52 per cent, down from 57 per cent in 2022. Under Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, the country aims to increase its overall recycling rate to 70 per cent by 2030. The drop is due to the amount of construction and demolition waste — which is almost completely recycled — \"dropping significantly\" last year, said NEA. Construction and demolition waste, which is a key industrial waste stream that is generated in large amounts, decreased by more than 40 per cent in 2023 compared to 2022, as there were fewer demolition projects, the agency explained. Sharp year-on-year changes in the amount of waste would result in \"huge fluctuations\" to the overall recycling rates, NEA added. The latest statistics also showed that the domestic recycling rate remained at 12 per cent, while the non-domestic recycling rate decreased from 72 per cent in 2022 to 67 per cent. DECREASE IN DOMESTIC WASTE The domestic waste generated per capita — collected from households and trade premises such as schools and hawker centres — also decreased by more than 15 per cent over the last decade. In 2023, the daily domestic waste generated per capita was 0.88kg, down from 1.08kg in 2013. Non-domestic waste per dollar Gross Domestic Product generated at industrial and commercial premises also fell from 40 tonnes in 2013 to 26 tonnes last year — a more than 30 per cent drop. The decrease in waste generated indicates that households and companies have taken \"positive steps\" to reduce and reuse, said NEA. The agency added that it will continue to study new ways to close the various resource loops. This includes looking into using mixed materials from Singapore's only landfill Semakau — which is made up of incineration ashes and other waste materials — for reclamation. During a speech at the joint opening Singapore International Water Week and CleanEnviro Summit on Wednesday, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said that the government is exploring new technologies that could generate higher value products from mixed solid waste, while also reducing carbon emissions. NEA will assess the information gathered on industry’s interests and the commercial viability of these technologies, she said. Where suitable, pilot trials may be conducted to evaluate the potential of expansion to full-size disposal facilities, added Ms Fu. NEA on Wednesday highlighted that there is a \"greater urgency\" for everyone to build a sustainability culture to reduce, reuse, and recycle. \"By reducing waste and recycling right, we can do our part to combat climate change and ensure that Singapore remains clean, green, and liveable,\" it added.

For years, a woman who professed to be a deity exploited her followers' desperation for healing to cheat them of money and property She also inflicted physical punishments on them such as pulling out their teeth and asking them to eat human faeces Woo May Hoe cheated about S$7 million from her devotees and got them to take out another S$6 million in loans for her She was sentenced to 10 years and six months' jail By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 19, 2024 Updated June 19, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Over the course of about eight years, a woman who proclaimed herself to be a deity had close to 30 followers who turned to her because they were suffering from serious medical conditions or had relatives who were suffering, and were \"desperate for healing\". Preying on their vulnerable state, she cheated them of more than S$7 million and made them take another S$6.6 million in loans. She would mete out punishments for followers who did not listen to her orders. One devotee had her teeth pulled out, suffered a permanent eye injury and was forced to jump from the second floor of a building. Others had to eat human faeces. On Wednesday (June 19), Woo Mei Hoe, a 54-year-old Singaporean, was sentenced to 10.5 years' jail. She had pleaded guilty in May to two charges each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt and cheating, and one charge of instigating a person to cause hurt with a dangerous weapon. Another 45 charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. In her brief remarks when meting out the sentence, District Judge Ong Chin Rhu noted the breach of trust between Woo and her followers and the extent of financial and physical harm the victims suffered. As for the cheating offences, the judge said that Woo committed them in a “calculated and cruel” manner and over a sustained period. The judge took into consideration Woo’s guilty plea and her paranoid schizophrenia that a doctor assessed had a contributory link to the offences of hurting others, but not for cheating. Paranoid schizophrenia is a form of psychosis. People who suffer from it need medication and therapy to manage the symptoms, which can include having persistent and unusual beliefs and thoughts, and being suspicious of people and a general fear of other people's intentions. FOLLOWERS PAID MILLIONS, BOUGHT HOUSES FOR ‘WORSHIP' The court previously heard that Woo led a group of people who believed in Sri Sakthi Narayani Amma — a spiritual leader in India — and they met up frequently for ritual sessions, prayers and spiritual teachings that would last until the wee hours of the morning. In court documents prepared by Deputy Public Prosecutors Timotheus Koh and Grace Chua, they said: “During the sessions, the accused told her followers that she was a deity with the ability to communicate with gods and spirits and dictated that they refer to her as ‘lord’.” Woo taught her followers that they could clear their “bad karma” and increase their “good karma” by making payments to Amma’s society in India, via payments made through her. However, she then kept the money for her own use. Aside from getting her followers to make monetary payments ranging from thousands to millions of dollars, she ordered her followers to buy condominiums and cars as a purported “form of worship”, which she used for her own enjoyment. Some of the devotees depleted their savings and pawned their valuables. Others sold their houses and took up extensive loans from banks, among others. In all, Woo cheated a total of over S$13.61 million from them — comprising about S$7 million from her followers and another S$6.61 million in loans they took from financial institutions. Between 2013 and 2015, Woo cheated one follower of S$3.5 million, purportedly for the expansion of a school compound in a village in India. She also cheated the same victim of another S$2.5 million for a fictitious temple building project. As the victim was suffering from a serious medical condition and had extensive medical bills of her own, payments were made in instalments to Woo of S$100,000 a month. ORDERED TO EAT FAECES, JUMP DOWN FROM BUILDING Woo also severely punished her followers with “violent and degrading” punishments from time to time if they displeased her, the prosecution said. “This included hitting her followers with various implements such as paintbrushes and canes, stabbing them with scissors, using pliers to pull out their teeth, forcing them to consume human faeces and making them jump off from a height.” She would either carry out the punishments personally or ask other followers to inflict them. Around 10 followers resided with Woo to serve her full-time. One victim, who resided with Woo, was hit repeatedly on the head and face with a bundle of five canes by Woo when she was unhappy with the victim. The victim, who was in severe pain and had blurry vision, was told by Woo to use some “holy water” to wash her eye and stare directly into the sun to treat the pain. Her optic nerve was found to be damaged and she will require lifelong medical care for her injured eye, which suffers from weak vision. This same victim also had her teeth pulled out with pliers by another follower under the Woo's order. Woo was unhappy that the victim went to visit her mother without informing her. This was not the first time that the victim had her teeth pulled out as punishment, the prosecution said. The victim was also forced to jump down from the second floor of a building, leading her to suffer fractures on her feet. A doctor at the Institute of Mental Health assessed Woo in 2020 and found her to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of her offences, with a “contributory link” between her condition and the offences where she caused hurt to others. However, he found no contributory link between her mental state and her cheating offences, the prosecution added. 'GRATUITOUSLY' INFLICTED INJURIES The prosecution sought a jail term of between nine and 12 years, noting how Woo's actions had \"completely shattered\" the lives of her followers and caused permanent physical disability to some of them. It pointed to her abuse of the \"exceptional trust\" that her followers had placed on her as an aggravating factor. Defence counsel Caryn Lee pleaded for a lighter sentence of 69 months' jail for her client. She reiterated that her client suffers from mental illness. Woo had made partial financial restitution of S$675,000 to the victims as well. District Judge Ong took into account some of the aggravating factors such as the extent of the injuries the victims suffered and that Woo had inflicted them \"gratuitously as a form of punishment\". If not for the Woo's mental illness, \"the facts of the case would have called for substantially higher uplifts to the starting sentences for each charge\", she added. For the cheating offences, the judge outlined factors such as Woo's \"greed\" and the sustained duration of the deception among the aggravating factors. For each count of cheating, Woo could have been jailed up to 10 years or fined, or both. A person convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt can be jailed up to 10 years and be liable to a fine or caning. However, Woo cannot be caned by law since she is a woman.

A Singapore TikTok user has wowed viewers by lying on a bench and reaching backwards to play the piano keys This was at a public piano placed at the Orchard MRT Station She played a duet with a friend who was playing in a more conventional position Several viewers complimented her dexterity and flexibility The Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts music student responded to the comments saying that she was relying on her “muscle memory” to play By Deborah Lau By Deborah Lau Published June 19, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Watching musicians channel their “heart and soul” into their craft can be uplifting. For Singapore TikTok user “migraineyy”, it looked like it was her heart, soul and some elements of a core muscle workout. The TikToker, Ms Jovanna Yam, 21, has gone viral after she uploaded a video of herself and a female partner playing a duet of a portion of American musician Hoagy Carmichael’s 1930s tune Heart and Soul. In the video, Ms Yam is not seated at the piano — instead she is lying while facing away from the piano with her upper back flat on the piano stool. Her hands are reaching backwards to the piano keys. Her feet, while not visible, seem to be on the floor. This means that her body is in a similar pose to what is known in the fitness world as the “bridge position”, which is designed to strengthen a person’s core muscles. It also means that she is playing with her hands behind her head, unable to see the keys. The other player is crouched near the piano. The pair appear to be playing a public piano situated at Orchard MRT Station, which is part of train operator SMRT ’ s Music in Community programme. The video, published a week ago and titled “When pianists get too bored”, has since garnered more than 210,000 likes, 5,000 shares and more than 500 comments. ‘TALENTED, IMPRESSIVE, AMAZING’ Several TikTok users complimented Ms Yam’s dexterity and flexibility, with comments such as “impressive”, “amazing” and “more than talented”. One TikTok user did not think that “(a strong) core is an issue”, but marvelled at how Ms Yam was able to do it. Ms Yam responded to the comment saying that relying on her “muscle memory” helped. Many users also praised her for her bravery in performing the feat at an MRT station, with one saying that a person would feel immediately “embarrassed” if people were to watch them. Another jokingly commented: “When your lower back hurts but you have to practise still.” Requests for Ms Yam to perform more songs, while in this position, have also poured in in the comments section of the post. Responding to TODAY’s queries, Ms Yam, who frequently posts piano content, said on Wednesday that she loves to come up with “creative ideas to entertain my audience”. This includes playing the instrument \"upside down\". “It’s uncommon to see pianists perform ‘tricks’, so I decided to do it in public as well.” She added that she has since picked up other song requests from her viewers who wanted her to play them in that position. She said that it was initially challenging to play this way because she was playing the piano backwards without looking at the keys. “I had to mentally ‘reverse’ the piano key structures and change fingerings, which teased my mind. Even sometimes, my mind and hand coordination do not sync,\" she added. “After a couple of attempts, I got the hang of it as my muscle memory and inner-hearing aided the whole process.” Ms Yam is pursuing a Bachelor of Education (Honours) in instrumental and vocal teaching at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. The degree programme is offered in collaboration with the Royal College of Music in London. She also works part-time as a freelance piano teacher, and teaches pop, classical and piano theory to students ranging from beginners to early advanced levels. “I feel that my efforts are greatly appreciated by the TikTok community since many of them felt impressed. “This has motivated me (to) post more unconventional and quirky piano content to inspire other musicians and bring joy to people.” Related topics Trending music piano TikTok Read more of the latest in News Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-wthcjlPOfCM')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-6ezQLEf8wng')); Trending Content is loading...

They face a total of nine charges related to encouraging and cultivating the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis) terrorist group’s ideology. On May 17, lone assailant Radin Luqman, 21, was killed after an unprovoked attack on the Ulu Tiram police station in the wee hours of the morning. Two police officers died from a machete attack, while a third was injured after being shot. The five family members who have been charged were identified as Radin Imran Radin Mohd Yassin, 62, his wife Rosna Jantan, 59, and their three children Radin Romyullah, 34, Farhah Sobrina, 23 and Mariah, 19. Malaysian media have identified Rosna as a Singaporean. TODAY has asked Singaporean authorities to confirm her nationality. All five family members arrived in the court’s compound in separate vehicles under heavy guard by the Special Branch’s counter-terrorism staff. According to the charge sheet, Radin Imran, the family’s father who is unemployed, faces four charges under the Penal Code: He allegedly promoted terrorist acts by instilling Isis ideology in his family members, including the slain Ulu Tiram police station attacker, Radin Luqman, between the end of 2014 until May 17 this year at a house along Jalan Rabani in Kampung Sungai Tiram He is alleged to have supported terrorism acts by storing four self-made air rifles for terrorism activities at the same location at around 10.45am on May 17 He is alleged to have pledged his oath of allegiance to Isis leader Abu Bakar Al-Baghdadi at the end of 2014 He is alleged to be in possession of a book related to Isis ideology His son Radin Romyullah was charged with pledging his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakar and possession of an external hard disc drive containing materials related to Isis and the group's activities. Meanwhile the family’s mother Rosna and her two daugthers, Farhah Sobrina and Mariah, were handed one charge each for deliberately omitting to provide information regarding crimes related to terrorist ideology. The court did not offer bail and the accused were advised by the judge to appoint a lawyer to represent them in the cases.

Sim Kian Hong, a Singaporean, molested his neighbour in May last year when she was 10 years old. The victim’s name cannot be published under a court order to protect her identity. Court documents showed that the victim was on the way home from a nearby supermarket after buying groceries at about 4pm on May 8, 2023. She stopped for a while along the pavement to catch her breath when Sim approached her. The girl recognised him as a neighbour who lived in the same housing block. He offered to help carry her items back home but she declined. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Andrea Gan said that Sim then walked ahead of her, but his pace matched the girl's. When they reached their housing block and entered the lift, Sim stood slightly behind the girl. “The victim used her handphone to avoid getting into a conversation with the accused,” DPP Gan said. Sim then put his hand near the girl's shoulder while leaning forward such that his face was close to hers. He then reverted to standing upright before touching her chest over her clothes “for about 14 seconds”. Feeling uncomfortable and scared, the victim got out of the lift quickly once it reached her floor. She made a police report the next day. DPP Gan sought an 8.5 months’ jail term, saying that Sim displayed “some degree of predatory behaviour”. “Further, as the accused lives in the same block, and the molest took place in the lift of the victim’s own block, the victim may be forced to relive her trauma constantly,” DPP Gan added. A molest offence carries a jail term of up to three years or a fine or caning, or a combination of any of these punishments. For molesting a victim under the age of 14, a person can be jailed up to five years, fined or caned, or be handed a combination of any of these. Sim cannot be caned by law since he is above the age of 50.

AFP An F-16 plane of the Republic of Singapore Air Force landing on a public road in Lim Chu Kang during a media preview in 2016. New: You can now listen to articles.

Pitch rate gyroscopes are sensors that a flight control computer uses to control an aircraft and all F-16 fighter jets are fitted with four such gyroscopes. The pilot was unable to control the plane at take-off because its pitch rate gyroscopes gave erroneous inputs to the flight control computer, Mindef said on May 18. The pilot responded \"in accordance with emergency procedures\" and ejected within Tengah Air Base before being evacuated to hospital. Training for Singapore's F-16 fleet was temporarily suspended in the wake of the crash but resumed after the cause of the crash was identified. WHAT HAPPENED Mindef said in its update on Wednesday that two out of four pitch rate gyroscopes in the aircraft gave \"erroneous but similar inputs\" to the digital flight control computer. It was found that the two gyroscopes had degraded due to wear and tear and failed during take-off. Former Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) pilot Ong Swee Chuan previously told CNA that at any one time, three out of four of them are used and the average of two is taken to provide data to the flight control computer, With two gyroscopes registering erroneous inputs that were similar, the flight control logic \"accepted\" them as \"correct\" while rejecting the inputs from each of the remaining functioning gyroscopes as \"incorrect\", said Mindef. \"This caused the digital flight control computer to manoeuvre the aircraft in response to the erroneous pitch rate feedback signal from the two degraded gyroscopes, making the F-16 uncontrollable by the pilot,\" it added. NO FAULT DETECTED BEFORE TAKE-OFF The investigation, which was led by the RSAF and supported by Lockheed Martin and the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau, also concluded that the F-16 aircraft was maintained according to established protocols. The RSAF had adhered to required maintenance inspections, said Mindef Mindef added that the F-16's pre-flight built-in test \"did not detect any fault\" with the aircraft's gyroscopes before take-off. \"It is assessed that the two pitch rate gyroscopes had degraded due to wear and tear and failed during take-off,\" said Mindef. It added that the RSAF has put in place an additional preventive maintenance procedure for the gyroscopes to reduce the chance of a reoccurrence. RSAF engineers will periodically remove the F-16 gyroscope assemblies and test them using specialised equipment to increase the likelihood for engineers to detect early signs of degradation, said the Defence Ministry. This will allow them to \"pre-emptively replace the gyroscopes, before the gyroscopes reach the stage of accelerated degradation leading to failure\". This measure is over and above the prescribed aircraft manufacturer's maintenance procedures, noted Mindef. It also said that each RSAF F-16 aircraft's flight control gyroscopes had been checked and cleared before it resumed F-16 flights on May 21. \"According to Lockheed Martin, this is a rare occurrence and the first such failure reported to it since the F-16s first flew in 1974,\" said Mindef. With approximately 3,100 F-16s operating in 25 countries and over 19 million flight hours, Mindef added it remains \"confident in the operational capability and reliability of the F-16 to defend Singapore's skies\".

Alexandria Tammy Lim Xuan Yi, 25, and Clara Yip Zi, 20, were each handed two charges: One of committing mischief by fire, and one of conspiring to commit mischief by fire. Both women appeared in court without any legal representation, via a link from their place of remand. The police on Wednesday evening said in a press release that they received a report at 10.35pm on Monday about a case of fire. This was outside a Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat along Canberra Road in Sembawang. The two women were identified and arrested the next day. Court documents showed that they both allegedly set fire to three slippers outside the front door of a flat at Block 352C along Canberra Road on June 17. The pair, along with another unknown person on messaging application Telegram, also allegedly agreed at about 2am on Tuesday to set fire to the house door and shoe rack outside a housing unit along Hougang Avenue 3. Court documents did not mention when they intended to carry out their plan. On Thursday, Yip informed the court that she intends to plead guilty. The court offered her bail of S$15,000 but required a parent to be one of the bailors, to which Yip said that she has “no parents”. When asked by the judge to clarify this, she said that both had “died already”. Her case will be heard again on June 24 for a bail review and on Aug 1 for her guilty plea to be taken. For Lim, the prosecution informed the court that she is under further investigations for cheating-related offences. Bail of S$15,000 was also offered to her. Her case will be heard again in court on July 18. If convicted of committing mischief by fire or conspiring as such, a person can be jailed for up to seven years or fined.

By Rachel Chan By Rachel Chan Published June 20, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — While several beaches in Singapore have been largely cleared of oil following an oil spill last week, Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat said on Thursday (June 20) that it will still take \"some time\" before the oil is completely removed. In a joint statement on Thursday, Singapore's authorities said clean-up efforts by the National Environment Agency (NEA) are progressing well at East Coast Park and a \"large majority\" of oil deposits on the beach had been removed. The beaches at Tanah Merah have also been largely cleaned up, while the beaches on three Singapore islands — St John's, Lazarus and Kusu — as well as a \"large majority\" of Sentosa's Siloso beach have been cleared of oily sand, they added. In a Facebook post, Mr Chee noted the progress made in the clean-up, saying: \"Currently, we are focused on cleaning up the oil slicks and sheens from water and land which are visible through drone surveillance and satellite imagery. \"In the next phase, we would need to flush out stranded oil, such as those on oil-stained rock bunds... The clean-up operation will take some time, and I would like to seek the understanding of members of the public and businesses who are affected by this incident.\" On June 14, oil washed up along the coast of a number of beaches in Singapore after a Netherlands-flagged dredger, Vox Maxima, hit Singapore-flagged bunker Marine Honour at Pasir Panjang Container Terminal (PPT). This caused one of the oil cargo tanks on Marine Honour to rupture, spilling about 400 tonnes of low-sulphur fuel into the sea. The resultant oil spill that spread to several coastlines and stained the sand black was not caused by port congestion, Mr Chee said on Tuesday. Wallace Woon/CNA Workers scoop oil-soaked sand into trash bags along the shoreline at East Coast Park on June 20, 2024. CLEAN-UP EFFORTS The Maritime and Port Authority (MPA), NEA, the National Parks Board (NParks), Singapore's national water agency PUB, the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) on Thursday gave an update on the ongoing clean-up efforts. They noted that while the beaches at East Coast Park and Tanah Merah have been largely cleaned up, more efforts would likely be required as the tides may continue to sweep in remnants of oil deposits. The thorough cleaning of the oil-stained rock bunds facing the lagoon at Sentosa's Siloso beach will also start soon. As for Sentosa's Palawan and Tanjong beaches, clean-up efforts are ongoing, with more focused cleaning planned after the clean-up at Siloso beach is completed. The deployment of containment booms off the three Sentosa beaches have been completed, the authorities said. \"While the beaches remain open and island businesses are operating as per normal, sea activities and swimming are not permitted,\" they added. Wallace Woon/CNA A piece of driftwood soaked with crude oil on a wooden pallet along the shore at East Coast Park on June 20, 2024. The recovery of accumulated oil off Labrador Nature Reserve and Cooper Channel is ongoing after booms were put in place on Tuesday, in addition to the booms deployed previously to protect Berlayer Creek and the Rocky Shore at the reserve. While the beaches at St John’s, Lazarus and Kusu Island have been cleared of oily sand, these beaches will be monitored for further signs of oil slicks, the authorities said. No oil was seen at Changi and Pasir Ris beaches as of Wednesday evening, but NEA will continue to monitor the situation closely. The public are advised not to swim at these beaches or engage in other primary contact water activities as a precaution until further notice. No oil has also been observed off biodiversity-sensitive areas at Chek Jawa Wetlands at Pulau Ubin, Coney Island Park and Pasir Ris Park. Wallace Woon/CNA A containment boom soaked with crude oil seen on the shore at East Coast Park on June 20, 2024. \"Absorbent booms will continue to be deployed there as preventive measures. No oil has been observed off West Coast Park and absorbent booms have been deployed as a precaution to protect the mangroves at the Marsh Garden,\" said the authorities. They added that there have not been any reports of oil slicks sighted off Changi since Tuesday. The northern part of Pasir Panjang Terminal has been cleared of oil slicks since Tuesday, while thorough cleaning using high-pressure jets of Berth 36 — which is near the area where Vox Maxima hit Marine Honour — is ongoing. In addition to three current busters already deployed — two of them are at western affected areas at PPT and Sentosa, while the other is at eastern affected areas off East Coast and Changi East — the authorities added that another current buster system will be deployed soon. A current buster is a system that is designed to collect oil on the surface of the water. Towed by two vessels, it sweeps the water's surface, funneling the oil towards an area where it is contained. In addition to containment booms laid at the mouth of Keppel Marina, a total of about 20 clean-up personnel and two skimmer systems have been deployed since Tuesday to recover the accumulated oil. Half-floating on the water’s surface, skimmers lift the oil off the water surface into storage tanks, ensuring that it does not also collect too much sea water in the process. ONE15 Marina has maintained restricted access to the marina while localised clean-up efforts are ongoing, said the authorities. They added that Singaporean authorities are in touch with Malaysian counterparts to cooperate on efforts to address any further impact of the oil spill. Together with Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are part of the Revolving Fund Committee, where the three littoral states can request and provide support for oil spills and clean-up operations in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. LOCAL FISH, WATER SUPPLY UNAFFECTED Singapore's fish farms have not been affected by the oil spill to date, the authorities said. \"Nonetheless, as a precautionary measure, the SFA has taken fish samples from coastal fish farms in the East Johor Strait for food safety tests. The test results confirmed that our local fish are safe for consumption.\" The drinking water supply in Singapore is also unaffected, with quality reading remaining normal and operations at all desalination plants and reservoirs operating as usual, said PUB. Air quality at affected areas at East Coast Park, Labrador Nature Reserve and Sentosa \"remains well within safe levels\", said the authorities. \"NEA will continue to monitor the air quality at the affected areas daily to ensure the safety of the public and personnel involved in the clean-up operations. Information on air quality at affected beaches is published and updated daily on NEA’s website.\" CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

Civil servants in grades equivalent to MX13(I) and MX14 will receive an additional payment of S$150. Those in grades equivalent to MX15 and MX16, as well as those in the Operations Support Scheme (OSS) Grades III and IV, will receive an additional payment of S$250. PSD said the mid-year payment takes into consideration both the better economic outlook and downside risks that remain in the global economy. \"The Government will continue to monitor the economic situation closely. It will take into consideration the guidelines by the National Wages Council which will be released later in the year, in determining the year-end annual variable component payments,\" it added. Last year, civil servants received a 0.3-month mid-year bonus and a 0.6-month year-end bonus, as well as the non-pensionable annual allowance of one month, also known as the 13th-month bonus. Junior grade officers also received an additional S$200 or S$400 as part of the mid-year bonus, and S$400 or S$800 at the end of 2023. The Singapore economy grew by 2.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter of 2024, extending the 2.2 per cent expansion in the previous quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has maintained the GDP growth forecast of 1 per cent to 3 per cent for 2024. \"The assessment takes into consideration that the external economic environment has remained resilient in the first quarter of 2024, although downside risks remain in the global economy,\" said PSD on Thursday. PSD added that the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Market Report for the first quarter of the year showed that total employment continued to expand albeit at a moderated pace. Unemployment rates remained low and within the range observed during non-recessionary periods. \"Our public sector unions had a productive discussion with the Public Service Division, where the unions called for the hard work of our civil servants to be recognised,\" said Ms Cham Hui Fong, deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). Given this year's positive economic growth despite uncertainties ahead, the Government's mid-year payout is \"reflective of the economic performance and acknowledges their efforts,\" she added. Mr Sanjeev Kumar Tiwari, general secretary of the Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE), said that the payout, which surpasses the previous year's mid-year sum, would boost the morale of civil servants. \"While there are still uncertainties ahead, this payout fairly acknowledges the efforts of our officers and demonstrates progressiveness by ensuring lower-income officers can cope with inflation and rising living costs.\" CNA For more stories like this, visit cna.asia.

New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. A Singapore TikTok user has created a Google word document giving details of every student hostel at the Nanyang Technological University It is supposedly aimed at people who want to know more about their hostel of choice, and snippets of the document were shown in a video The TikTok user said the information was from word of mouth, an online forum and social media It includes the price range and some floor plans for hostel rooms, as well as each hostel’s quirks or culture By Deborah Lau By Deborah Lau Published June 20, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — For many university students, moving into a hostel on campus during their undergraduate years is often seen as a rite of passage. Each residential hall is typically associated with its own unique hall culture, which attracts different types of students. Given the extended periods of time that one would have to spend with one’s hostel mates, it is no wonder then that some students would go to great lengths to ensure that they pick a suitable hostel. For TikTok user “wearyyyyyyyyyy”, this entailed creating an entire Google word document detailing what she has found about each of the 23 residential hall’s culture at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The TikTokker, Miss Jaime Aw, 20, will begin her first year of studies at NTU's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information in August this year. She published a seven-second video on Wednesday (June 19) night showing snippets of the online document. Listed in the document are casual comments on halls that have a “chill” culture that “welcomes everybody to try out different (co-curricular activities) compared to the sports and dance halls”, halls that have “limited food options” and that seemingly have mould or persistent “termite issues\", or where students have encountered various wildlife such as monkeys, snakes and toads. Where available, Miss Aw has also attached images of the floor plans of hostel rooms. The information about NTU’s different halls includes their addresses and the price range for both air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned double rooms in the upcoming academic year. In a note at the top of the document, Miss Aw states that the information was gathered “mostly based on word of mouth and Reddit (or) other sources like Lemon8”. Reddit is an online forum and Lemon8 is a social media application by the creators of video-sharing app TikTok. It is not known if the information provided is accurate or verified. When contacted by TODAY, Miss Aw also said that she was not sure if the content is \"reliable\", but she was curious to know which NTU halls had the best and worst culture, because the main reason she is looking to stay in a hostel is to make new friends. Some TikTok viewers had asked that she make public the full document and she intends to do so eventually, she told TODAY. When she does so, Miss Aw said that she is open to receiving comments on what students feel their hall culture is like. Since it was uploaded less than 24 hours ago, the video has received more than 600 likes and been shared almost 150 times. It has sparked discussion on some of the hall choices. One TikTok user joked that “Crespion” — referring to NTU’s Crespion and Pioneer halls — were “the best”, sarcastically remarking that they had “no hall culture at all”. Another TikTok user said that Halls 8 to 10 have several stairs and residents could be heavily exposed to dust due to the nearby construction of an MRT station, before adding that freshmen at the university are not allowed to choose their halls and it is randomly allocated. This TikToker also said that the “rec lists” for most halls have since closed for the new intakes. “Rec lists” refer to lists of recommendations of prospective hall residents that can be put forth by a senior student already residing in that hall. Some students believe that being placed on a hall’s “rec list” may raise their chances of being accepted into that hall of their choice. Acknowledging in a comment that the university’s freshmen are unable to select a residential hall of their choice, Miss Aw said that she would instead be using this as reference in the future to prepare herself for what to expect of each hostel's culture. On Thursday evening, she posted another video saying that she made the online document for herself, but asked viewers to give their take on what the halls are like in the document, which she then shared in the comments section of the video.

Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras arriving at the State Courts on June 20, 2024. New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. A former police officer was found to have forged 38 statements across 21 case files while he was an investigating officer After resigning from the police force and while applying to be a lawyer, Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras lied and said he was not under any police investigation A doctor from the Institute of Mental Health diagnosed Willjude with adjustment disorder, which later evolved into major depressive disorder The 33-year-old was sentenced to 25 months’ jail Published June 20, 2024 Updated June 20, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — While serving as an investigating officer in the Singapore Police Force, Willjude Vimalraj Raymond Suras forged statements that he was tasked to take from witnesses for investigation. On at least one occasion, he called a person over the phone and took notes before crafting his own statement based on the notes he took and backdating the document to meet an overdue deadline. Another time, he submitted a statement without interviewing the person directly. After resigning from the police force, he applied to be called to the Singapore Bar as a lawyer. During this application, he falsely declared that he was not under investigation, even though he was being investigated by the police for the said forgery offences. On Thursday (June 20), the 33-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to 25 months’ jail after pleading to nine charges of forgery and one of intentionally giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding. Another 29 forgery charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that Willjude’s supervisor in the police force had found his performance to be poor and spoke to him on several occasions, without seeing any progress after that. He was with the Woodlands Police Division at the time. When reviewing his case files on Jan 26 in 2019, the supervisor saw that identical statements were recorded from two witnesses for two unrelated cases. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Grace Chua said that this led the supervisor to suspect that the statements may have been forged. “She called the witnesses to check if the accused had recorded statements from them and was told that he did not,” DPP Chua added. When questioned, Willjude admitted to forging the statements. A “thorough” review of all his case files uncovered 38 forged statements across 21 case files. Some of the affected cases were re-investigated where necessary, with fresh statements taken. “It was found that all case outcomes were not affected by the forgeries,” DPP Chua said. On one occasion, Willjude was handed a case in November 2018 but failed to record statements from the two witnesses involved despite being given time extension until Jan 5, 2019. The day before the extended deadline, he called one witness over the phone, took notes and wrote up a statement based on his own notes. He did not call the other witness and penned his own statements. For both forged documents, he wrote the date as Dec 30, 2018 in order to give the impression that they were recorded before the deadline. For another case that he was assigned sometime in January 2019, he was tasked to interview two persons. However, he “felt that there was no need to do so” and instead forged their statements, aligning the contents to the statements of two other witnesses he had earlier interviewed, DPP Chua said. Willjude resigned from the police force on April 19 in 2019 while investigations for his forgery offences were ongoing. Law-trained, he applied to be admitted as an advocate and solicitor. When submitting a sworn affidavit dated Dec 22, 2020, he gave false evidence by declaring that he was not under any investigation. A senior consultant at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) diagnosed Willjude with adjustment disorder, which later evolved into major depressive disorder. The doctor found a contributory link between Willjude’s mental condition and his forgery offences, but no contributory link between the condition and the offence of giving false evidence. Seeking a total sentence of 30 months’ jail, DPP Chua said that the need for general deterrence “applies with a special force” for law enforcement officers who break the law and abuse public trust in the course of their duty. The forgeries committed also have the potential to “shake public confidence” in the police, she added. She also mentioned that some aggravating factors were the calculated manner in which Willjude committed the offence, as well as the extensive efforts to track his forgeries and re-investigate the affected cases. Defence lawyer Azri Imran Tan highlighted his client’s psychiatric condition as a mitigating factor in asking for a lower sentence of between 12 and 17 months behind bars. He argued that Willjude's offending behaviour was \"out of character\" and quoted the IMH doctor's report, which stated that Wulljide was working in a “toxic and depressogenic” environment under the supervisor that reported his offence. Depressogenic describes something that could cause someone to develop depression. The inspector was “driven to overwhelming depressive despair, for instance, to act in ways which he would not when mentally healthy\". Mr Tan added, though, that no aspersion is being cast against his client’s supervisor or the police force, but he was just setting out the conditions that had affected Willjude at that time. For each count of forgery, Willjude could have been sentenced to a jail term of up to four years or fined, or both. For giving false evidence in a judicial proceeding, he could have been jailed up to seven years and also been fined.

An unemployed Singaporean took up an offer to work for a loan shark syndicate based in China Over the years, Ng Kwong Seng rose to become a \"towkay\" and had loan sharks reporting to him He earned about S$500,000 in profits from his involvement in the illegal business for about 13 years Ng was sentenced to more than four years' jail for carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 21, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — For about 13 years, Ng Kwong Seng worked for an illegal moneylending syndicate, rising through the ranks from a salary-drawing support worker to a “towkay” or boss entitled to profit-sharing and with loan sharks reporting to him. While he was mostly based in China during that period, the Singaporean targeted debtors in Singapore, charging 20 per cent interest for the loans and relying on runners based here to carry out operations. On Friday (June 21), Ng, now 44, was sentenced to 51 months’ jail and a fine of S$495,000. However, as he was unable to pay the fine, he was ordered to serve another 33 weeks behind bars in default. He pleaded guilty earlier this month to seven charges of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending. Two other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing. HOW THE SYNDICATE WORKED Court documents showed that Ng was recruited into the syndicate sometime in mid-2006 by an ex-colleague who offered him a job as an office support staff member in China for a monthly salary of S$2,000. Ng accepted it because he was unemployed in Singapore. He started working for the syndicate in an apartment in Shenzhen, China. It was financed by a person identified in court documents only as \"Ah Ren\". Ah Ren was the syndicate's “tua towkay”, or big boss. Reporting to him were \"towkays\" or bosses responsible for managing the operations of various \"ah longs\", or unlicensed moneylenders. Ng started off by helping an ah long known as \"Freddi\" solicit debtors from Singapore, calling up phone numbers from a database provided to him. He would work from 11am to 4pm and make about 150 calls a day. He was promoted to an “assistant ah long” in January 2008 and was authorised to give out small loans when Freddi was busy. He was then promoted to a full-fledged ah long in July that year, after Freddi left the syndicate for unknown reasons. Ng had runners based in Singapore to carry out tasks such as verifying information and collecting and issuing money to debtors. From end-2008 to mid-2010, Ng moved his operations to Bangkok, Thailand before returning to China. As an ah long, he was entitled to up to 20 per cent of the business profits, depending on a certain threshold of profit made. He was then drawing between S$3,000 and S$5,000 a month, inclusive of the base salary of S$2,000. Sometime in end-2014, he was promoted to towkay, with three ah longs reporting under him. He took no basic salary but was entitled to 60 per cent of the profits — though a portion of this would go to the three loan sharks. He earned an average of between S$10,000 and S$12,000 a month. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Emily Koh said that Ng did not harass debtors. This was done by another person identified as \"Xiao Fu\", who would arrange for runners or debtors in Singapore to conduct harassments of other debtors. Sometime in 2019, Ah Ren, who was the big boss and financier, was arrested and Ng left the illegal moneylending business. He remained in China working as a sales manager of a liquor company until June last year. DPP Koh said that Ng had planned to get his two daughters — aged 11 and six — to Singapore to continue with their education. “As such, the accused decided to stop working in China and return to Singapore to settle his case,” she added. Ng was eventually arrested on Nov 1 last year at Changi Airport. “In the course of investigations, the accused admitted that he earned profits of around S$500,000 from his unlicensed moneylending business from 2006 to 2019,” DPP Koh said. The money was spent on his family, personal expenses and for gambling in casinos in Macau and Hong Kong, she added. In delivering her decision, Principal District Judge Jill Tan noted the cross-border nature of the illegal moneylending business as well as the prolonged period Ng had conducted the business as main aggravating factors. The significant numbers of borrowers and amounts disbursed, as well as the excessive interest charged, were also aggravating. Even though Ng “did not personally” carry out harassment of debtors, he was aware that threats were being made for debtors who had difficulties in making payments, the judge added. However, she took into consideration in Ng’s favour the fact that he had voluntarily returned to Singapore, co-operated with investigations and pleaded guilty to his offences. For each offence of carrying on the business of unlicensed moneylending, Ng could have been sentenced to a fine of between S$30,000 and S$300,000 and a jail term of up to four years, and also been liable to caning.

By Natasha Ganesan By Natasha Ganesan Published June 21, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — The Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) new light machine gun and PUB's water wagons will make their debuts at this year's National Day Parade (NDP) at the Padang. This year's parade will commemorate 40 years of Total Defence, Singapore's national defence concept. The inaugural Total Defence segment at the Padang will showcase how the community and government respond to various scenarios such as air and maritime threats as well as civil emergencies and disruptions. It will include 40 assets and more than 400 participants from the Singapore Army, Republic of Singapore Navy, Republic of Singapore Air Force, Digital and Intelligence Service, Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). National water agency PUB and the Singapore Red Cross will also be part of the segment, said the NDP executive committee in a news release on Friday (June 21). PUB's water wagons will also be making their National Day Parade debut. Equipped with 1,000L water tanks, these wagons provide relief in times of disruption to the water supply. Syamil Sapari/CNA The PUB water wagon is equipped with a 1,000L tank to provide potable water, and is one of the assets that will be making its debut at this year's NDP. This year's parade will also feature the Singapore Red Cross Transporter vehicle, which can carry volunteers and essential logistics during civil emergency exercises. The vehicle is equipped with a wheelchair lifter and can seat up to 10 people, including the driver. It can also be used in peacetime. Other assets making their appearance at the parade include F-16 fighter jets, the Leopard 2SG main battle tanks and the light fire attack vehicle, also known as the Red Rhino. WHAT TO EXPECT DURING THE PARADE AND CEREMONY More than 2,100 participants from diverse backgrounds will take part in this year's parade and ceremony. A total of 35 marching contingents, including 24 from youth uniformed groups as well as social and economic organisations, will form the parade led by parade commander Lieutenant Colonel Roger Cheong Soon Yong. Besides the usual contingents, this year's NDP will also feature the return of a contingent comprising volunteers from the SAF and Home Team. They will be making their first NDP appearance since 2019. Sixteen supporting contingents — from the SAF, SPF and SCDF, as well as volunteer and youth uniformed groups — will move to create the characters \"TD40\" to commemorate 40 years of Total Defence, said the executive committee. Speaking to CNA on Friday, Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Mohamed Ayub Said Abdul Kader, who is the parade Regimental Sergeant Major, explained that the formation's execution came with its own set of challenges as there was a lot of movement involved. With the contingents walking in different directions, the words \"'TD40' must come up beautifully\", he said. To overcome those challenges, MWO Mohamed Ayub said he spoke to his predecessor from 10 years ago — when there was a similar formation during NDP to mark 30 years of Total Defence — to learn the \"tips of the trade\". The 42-year-old added that he is backed by a well-trained team, made up of members with years of experience, to give him guidance on how the formation can be achieved. During the parade, there will also be a choir music video featuring more than 130 students from nine school choirs, including seven special education schools. Crowd favourites such as the Red Lions, state flag flypast and presidential gun salute will continue to be part of the NDP and will be broadcast live on television and internet platforms. This year’s presidential gun salute will include four 25-pounder guns on the Mobility 3rd Generation raft that will sail around the Marina Basin. The 21-gun salute is the highest military honour reserved only for the President and is timed to match his progress while inspecting the parade. NDP 2024 will also feature an Onward March at the Padang for the first time, where marching contingents will march onto the spectator stand. CNA For more reports like this, visit cna.asia .

New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. By Lee Chong Ming By Lee Chong Ming Published June 21, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) will require Carousell and Facebook to verify the identity of all their sellers if the number of scams reported on the respective platforms \"does not drop significantly\". The ministry will assess over a six-month period the effectiveness of both e-commerce platforms' measures to only verify the identity of sellers they deem \"risky\". If the scam situation fails to improve, MHA will then require them to apply user verification requirements on all sellers. This is part of the second tranche of provisions under the Online Criminal Harms Act (OCHA) that was passed in Parliament in July last year, MHA said on Friday (June 21). The new measures will come into force on June 24. OCHA targets online content used to facilitate scams and malicious cyber activities. Under the latest measures, authorities will issue two codes of practice — one for online communication services and another for e-commerce services. CODES OF PRACTICE The online communication code applies to online communication services Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram and WeChat, which MHA identified as presenting the \"highest risk of scams to Singapore users\". Under this code, providers of these online services must implement systems, processes or measures to detect and act against scams, use \"reasonable\" verification measures to prevent fake accounts or bots, require strong login verification, and submit an annual report on the implementation of these measures. Providers of the online communication services will be required to comply with the online communication code by Dec 31. On the other hand, the e-commerce code applies to online services that facilitate e-commerce activities and \"pose the highest risks of e-commerce scams among other services in Singapore\". Facebook Marketplace, Facebook Advertisements, Facebook Pages and Carousell will be required to comply with the code by Dec 31. These platforms accounted for more than 70 per cent of e-commerce scams in 2023. The code shares the same requirements as the online communication code, with two additional stipulations. Users must be verified against government-issued records if they advertise or post about the sale of goods and services, or if they intend to do so. Services must provide payment protection mechanisms that verify the delivery of goods or services before releasing payment to sellers. \"These additional requirements are based on what MHA assesses to be more critical in protecting Singapore end-users from e-commerce scams,\" the ministry said. The online communication code, along with the code of practice for e-commerce services, will take effect on June 26, MHA said. USER VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT Under the e-commerce code, MHA will prioritise the implementation of user verification requirements, which it assessed to be the \"most critical to curb scams\". For a start, it will allow Carousell and Facebook Marketplace to only apply verification requirements on \"risky sellers\" before expanding to more users if the scam situation fails to improve. \"Risky sellers\" are users identified by these platforms as potential sources of scams. MHA said on Friday it will assess the effectiveness of Carousell's measures to verify the identity of \"risky sellers\" between July 1 and Dec 31. \"If the number of e-commerce scams reported on Carousell does not drop significantly, MHA will require Carousell to verify the identity of all sellers by April 1, 2025,\" it said. A similar assessment will be conducted for Facebook Marketplace between June 1 and Nov 30, MHA added MHA will require Facebook Marketplace to verify the identity of all sellers by March 1, 2025, if the number of e-commerce scams reported on the platform \"does not drop significantly\". MHA also said that it will require Facebook to verify the identity of all advertisers by April 1, 2025, if the number of scam reports arising from advertisements on Facebook \"does not drop significantly\". Between July 1 and Dec 31, MHA will \"assess the effectiveness of Facebook’s measures to verify the identity of risky advertisers\", it added. MHA said it will not implement the user verification measure for Facebook Pages for now to allow Facebook to \"prioritise implementing user verification for its Marketplace and advertisements this year\". In a statement to the media on Friday, Carousell said that its users will be required to verify their identities using Singpass if its system \"detects behaviour similar to known scam patterns or policy violations\". Singpass verification is currently required only for two categories — property and tickets and vouchers. The marketplace platform will also be launching a safety policy to educate users on \"risky behaviours\", such as paying directly to the seller before receiving the item, said Ms Tan Su Lin, Carousell's chief of staff. THE ONLINE CRIMINAL HARMS ACT OCHA, which was passed in Parliament on July 5 last year, allows the government to order the takedown of websites, apps and online accounts suspected to be used for criminal activities. The threshold for ordering a takedown is lower for a particular category of criminal offences — scams and malicious cyber activities. For scams and malicious cyber activities, directions can be issued \"when there is suspicion or reason to believe that any online activity is being carried out in preparation for or as part of the commission\" of such offences, said Minister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. The directions may order a person or an online service to stop communicating specified online content, disable the content from being viewed, stop an account from communicating, block access to a web domain, or remove an app from an app store for Singapore users. Some measures under OCHA took effect on Feb 1, allowing the government to issue directions and orders to limit the exposure of Singapore users to criminal activities on online platforms. The measures also allow the government \"to require information to administer the Act and facilitate investigations and criminal proceedings\". Some criminal offences OCHA covers include those relating to: Terrorism and internal security Harmony between different races, religions or classes of population Incitement to violence Breaches of the Official Secrets Act Drugs Gambling Moneylending Scams and malicious cyber activities Sexual offences such as child abuse and voyeuristic material Collapse to view Expand to view PAYMENT PROTECTION MECHANISMS MHA said it would waive the requirement on payment protection mechanisms for now to allow services to prioritise implementing user verification, adding that it would reassess this in 2025. The need for this requirement will be assessed based on the effectiveness of the user verification measures in reducing e-commerce scams, it said. The ministry also said it will \"review the list of designated online services regularly based on the prevailing scam situation\". MHA added that all designated online services, including Carousell and Facebook Marketplace, are required to submit a report on the implementation of measures to comply with the requirements in the codes of practice. \"The competent authority will assess the adequacy of these measures and decide if further or enhanced measures would be required,\" it said. For Carousell and Facebook Marketplace, if the competent authority assesses that the measures are inadequate - for example, if there is no significant drop in the number of reported e-commerce scams - it may issue a new code application notice to require them to verify the identity of all sellers. If a provider of a designated online service has not complied with any requirement applicable to it, a rectification notice may be issued to it to correct the non-compliance by a specified time. \"Failure to comply with the rectification notice is a criminal offence,\" said MHA. An implementation directive may also be issued to the provider to \"implement a specific system, process or measure to address the risk of scams or malicious cyber activities\", it added.

By Justin Ong @JustinOngTODAY By Justin Ong Published June 21, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — The fourth stage of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL4) will improve connectivity for residents, but “it will get even better” in the coming decade with the opening of more MRT lines, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong. “Over the next decade, we will open over 50 new MRT stations, including the new Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line – our seventh and eighth MRT lines,” Mr Wong said at the opening ceremony of TEL4 on Friday morning (June 21). The ceremony was held at Marine Parade station, one of seven new stations along TEL4. The other stations are Tanjong Rhu, Katong Park, Tanjong Katong, Marine Terrace, Siglap and Bayshore. The seven new stations opened to the public for a preview from noon to 9pm on Friday, before passenger service officially starts on Sunday. Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister, recounted his days growing up in Marine Parade in the 1980s. “Back then, I wished there was an MRT station near my home in Marine Terrace, then I could have taken the train directly,” he said. He added that while he no longer lives in the area, he is glad residents can enjoy faster public transport that is affordable. Students will also benefit, with more than 10 schools within walking distance of a TEL4 station. TEL4 will also bring East Coast closer to Singaporeans from other parts of the island, noted Mr Wong, adding that popular food options in areas such as Joo Chiat and Katong would also be more accessible. He thanked residents along the TEL4 stretch for their patience while construction works were underway. Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat was also at the opening ceremony, along with Members of Parliament for constituencies which TEL4 passes through. They included Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat of East Coast GRC, Manpower Minister Tan See Leng and Speaker of Parliament Seah Kian Peng of Marine Parade GRC, as well as Mr Lim Biow Chuan of Mountbatten SMC. Former Prime Minister and former Marine Parade MP Goh Chok Tong and former Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan were also in attendance, along with representatives from rail operator SMRT, which runs the TEL. There were also performances by students from Tao Nan School, and local singers Lim Zi Yi and Karyn Wong. “IT WILL GET EVEN BETTER” FOR COMMUTERS With the opening of TEL4, 27 out of 32 TEL stations are now operational, said Mr Wong. For residents farther east, the fifth stage of the line – connecting Bayshore and Sungei Bedok – will be completed by 2026, while an extension to connect the TEL to Changi Airport will be completed in the mid-2030s, together with the opening of Terminal 5. When completed, the TEL’s eastern end will connect to Changi Airport, while its northern end will connect to the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link. “When the TEL is fully completed, our train network will connect Singaporeans from their doorstep to the world,” said Mr Wong. He said that the TEL is just part of the government’s investment in Singapore’s public transport system. “We are certainly not done expanding the rail network,” he said. The upcoming Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line will improve connectivity within the western region, and connect the eastern, northeastern and western regions respectively. In the coming years, new stations and extensions on existing lines, such as the North-South Line, Circle Line and Downtown Line, will also be opened. Ultimately, by the 2030s, eight in 10 households will be within a 10-minute walk of a train station, said Mr Wong. “Millions of Singaporeans and residents can reach their destinations using public transport easily and conveniently, day in and day out,” he said. Mr Wong added that, in Singapore, when there are plans made to build something, “eventually it gets done”. “In many other countries in the world, including in advanced countries, people talk about doing projects, but very often it’s not so easy to get things done,” he said. There could be issues with budgeting, resistance from residents or even political reasons, he said. “Sometimes, political parties change and the new party comes into power and they shelve the plans from the previous party,” he said. “Here in Singapore, when we say we will do something, we make sure we deliver it.” A LINE FOCUSED ON THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS Other than improving connectivity, the TEL has also been designed to ensure accessibility for those with special needs, said Mr Wong. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) had consulted widely with community partners, such as the Singapore Association for the Deaf and Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped, to incorporate inclusive features when designing TEL stations, he said. For instance, station signs have larger fonts, with sharper contrast and less clutter, and there is more braille text to aid the visually impaired. Hearing enhancement systems have been installed at the passenger service centres in TEL stations, which minimise the background noise for commuters wearing hearing aids. There are also more lifts and station entrances, to benefit those who face mobility challenges. “These features will benefit persons with disabilities, but also seniors and families with young children. They will enable all Singaporeans to take the train comfortably and confidently,” said Mr Wong. After his speech, Mr Wong spoke to SMRT and LTA staff, as well as TEL4 contractors. He then took the train from Marine Parade to Siglap, where he spoke to representatives from the Singapore Civil Defence Force about its shelter conversion operations for train stations. He also spoke to some students from Victoria School, which is located near Siglap station. At 11.30am outside Marine Parade station, members of the public had formed a long line to await the opening of the TEL4 preview. Among the earliest to get there was Marine Parade resident Jay Suresh, who said he has an avid interest in train stations. “I personally love the MRT, I love getting off the train stations and seeing the different areas, all the shops,” said the 21-year-old. The intern at a tech firm said his commuting time to his workplace in Alexandra will be reduced by about 30 minutes with the opening of TEL4. He currently takes the bus there, but he will soon be able to get to work via the TEL and the East-West Line with a change of trains at Outram Park station. “It’s definitely a big improvement from having to take the bus everywhere,” he said.

This year, celebrations for Pollisum Engineering's 40th anniversary happened to coincide with Father's Day on June 16. Before that, it held a lucky draw, where the winner, 36-year-old Sun Ke, was only told that he would receive a video message from his family. Then on June 16, Pollisum Engineering, which describes itself as a \"heavy lift and transport\" company, held its anniversary celebrations at the Montigo Resort in Batam, Indonesia. There, it invited Mr Sun Ke, a lorry crane driver who had been with the company for 10 years, on stage to watch the video message from his family. To the worker's surprise, his wife and daughter were ushered in soon after that. In a video shared by the company, a tearful Sun Ke could be seen rushing off the stage to share a warm embrace with his family. \"I feel like I'm dreaming,\" he said. He had been unable to see his family for over a year, because his daughter was still too young to travel. Speaking to TODAY in Mandarin, the worker said that he had been \"completely kept in the dark\". He had just spoken to his wife the day before the company bash and had planned to visit his family in September. His family had taken a six-hour flight from Jinan, China, to Singapore and a one-hour ferry ride from Singapore to Batam for the reunion. Mr Sun Ke and his family also enjoyed an extended vacation hosted by Holiday Inn Express & Suites from June 17 to 19. He said that his daughter \"kept asking for her father\" when it was time for his family to leave. \"I'm really looking forward to seeing them again.\" Pollisum Engineering Mr Sun Ke and his family at Montigo Resort, Batam in Indonesia. APPRECIATION FOR EMPLOYEES Pollisum Engineering described Mr Sun Ke as a \"dedicated husband and father\" who had undergone a one-month quarantine when he returned to China in 2021 to be with his wife when she was about to deliver their daughter. The girl was born in December that year as the Covid-19 pandemic was raging. He had to return to Singapore when his daughter was three months old. Pollisum Engineering said that its commitment to reward and acknowledge loyal employees is an \"integral part\" of its company culture. The company said: \"As a migrant worker, he (Mr Sun Ke) has limited time to spend with his family. \"Thus having them with him on Father’s Day was a morale boost that motivated him to further dedicate his skills and talents to grow with the company.\" Pollisum Engineering has a workforce of 278 employees with 78 per cent of them being migrant workers from mainly China and Malaysia. The company holds an annual dinner and dance to recognise the contributions made by its employees and celebrate the firm's achievements.

The offender pleaded guilty to four charges in relation to the abuse of the victim, who was under 16 years of age at the time. The charges were: Harassment Voluntarily causing hurt Insulting the modesty of the victim Distributing child abuse material Five other charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing. All parties in this case cannot be named to protect their identities. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that the victim, the offender, along with a co-accused identified in court documents as B2, were residents at the hostel. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Matthew Choo said that the offender and B2 stole some money from the victim, but when the victim confronted them sometime on or before July 19 last year, they denied the accusation and “took offence”. On the evening of July 19 itself, the offender and B2 forced the victim to go into a common toilet in the hostel and assaulted him. The offender warned the victim not to “falsely” make such accusations again or “there will be people waiting” for him outside his school, DPP Choo said. All three bumped into another teenager outside the toilet and recounted what just happened to the victim. This other teenager then told the pair not to beat up the victim any further, and reported the matter to the staff members of the hostel the next day. Two days after the toilet incident, B2 and the offender met the victim outside the hostel and pressured him to skip school with them. When they were out, B2 called a friend of the offender — another co-accused teenager who did not reside in the hostel and identified as B3 — to join them. The offender and B2 told B3 that they wanted to beat up the victim for the supposed “false” accusation and for reporting them to the hostel staff members over the toilet incident. The offender, B2 and the victim then met B3 at a car park in Punggol. Here, the trio allegedly slapped, punched and kicked the victim all over his body. B3 then allegedly recorded their assault of the victim using a mobile phone. The trio demanded that the victim strip naked, which he did out of fear, before beating him up further. They then made the victim lick the shoes of both the offender and B3 multiple times, with the offender kicking the victim’s face in the process. The three teenagers continued to hurt and insult the victim, such as kicking him in the groin area many times, making him kneel and beg for forgiveness and perform a dance in the nude, while recording him using mobile phones. At one point, one of them even recorded a close-up of the victim’s private parts. The offender also sent a video of the victim dancing in the nude to the teenager who had reported the toilet assault incident to the hostel. After the ordeal that lasted for about half an hour, they warned the victim to not inform anyone about what had happened or he would be beaten up again, and they left the scene. The victim got dressed, called his form teacher and headed to school. A school counsellor took him to the hospital, where he was examined and found to suffer from multiple swelling and bruises. He was later admitted to the ward, though the court documents did not mention how long he was warded. B2’s case is still pending before the courts, while B3 is undergoing investigation. The offender is expected to be sentenced in July. A person who distributes child abuse material can be jailed for up to seven years, fined or caned. Harassment carries a jail term of up to six months or a fine of up to S$5,000, or both. For voluntarily causing hurt, a person can be jailed for up to three years or fined up to S$5,000, or both. A person convicted of insulting a person's modesty can be jailed for up to one year or fined, or both.

By Nicole Chan By Nicole Chan Published April 3, 2024 Updated April 3, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Multiculturalism is largely celebrated in Singapore as a cornerstone of our society. However, discrimination still rears its ugly head from time to time, often in ways we may not even be aware of. On March 15, reports emerged of a photo shared on social media by a Singapore Armed Forces serviceman showing the user participating in military training with his peers. In his post, the serviceman used a caption that contained a derogatory racial term. While the Ministry of Defence was swift to condemn the act, the damage was already done — netizens took to online platforms to criticise the boys for their insensitivity. But some others were dismissive of or confused about the perceived “discrimination”, not understanding why the servicemen’s actions were harmful at all. LANGUAGE SHAPES THE WAY WE THINK (OR DON’T) I was recently at a client meeting where the conversation shifted into a mix of English and Mandarin, primarily from the Mandarin speakers in the room, who made up the majority. Being Chinese, I could follow along just fine — but I could clearly see how it was a struggle for colleagues in the minority, left scrambling to play catch-up in an already fast-paced discussion. Like many other cosmopolitan cities, Singapore is a melting pot of differing cultures, languages and ethnicities. However, in any such pot, the reality is that the dominant culture often takes precedence. Oftentimes, this dominance isn’t active or overt, nor is it forcefully enacted. Rather, it’s most commonly expressed in thoughtlessness — and this shows itself to be true even in everyday conversations and colloquialisms. We’ve likely witnessed or been part of similar occurrences in our everyday interactions, where dialect phrases and other non-English streams of speech are naturally slipped in without consideration of the other parties present. Another common example of inadvertent offence is backhanded compliments, where positive statements are followed up with discriminatory caveats: “You’re pretty for someone of your race”, for example, or “You’re smart compared to most women”. Such caveats imply that the quality being praised is unusual for someone by virtue of their race or gender. This both undermines them and reinforces negative stereotypes, and those on the receiving end often end up feeling invalidated or inferior. A 2022 joint survey by the Association of Women for Action and Research and Milieu Insight polled 1,000 respondents — nationally representative by age, gender and race — and found that in the past five years, around half of Singaporeans have experienced workplace discrimination. More serious forms of discrimination encompass unfair company policies and discriminatory employment practices related to career progression, including performance appraisals and promotion. For instance, individuals may receive a poorer performance appraisal after disclosing pregnancy, disability, or health conditions. While subtle forms of discrimination might be done without malicious intent, it can pose a significant problem if left unchecked. In the case of speaking in a different language, nuances and subtleties vital for understanding and relationship-building in and out of the workplace risk being lost in translation, leaving those in the minority feeling excluded or disadvantaged, both professionally and socially. Jonathan Kuek, a mental health researcher at Total Wellness Initiative Singapore, emphasises the “profound impact” on one’s mental well-being: “Such ostracism may trigger a range of emotions, from anger to anxiety to depression, and could leave individuals feeling worthless and lacking confidence in themselves.” Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Singapore is a melting pot of differing cultures, languages and ethnicities. However, in any such pot, the reality is that the dominant culture often takes precedence. NOT JUST ‘LOCKER ROOM TALK’ Our language choices also have the power to enforce unfair gender dynamics. During a discussion of an event’s dress code, a client’s male colleagues joked about turning up in their “birthday suit”. While this was met with scattered laughter, the meeting’s female participants’ chuckles seemed comparatively strained. Some exchanged uneasy glances. In incidents such as these, women often feel pressured to refrain from voicing their discomfort, or even to adapt and adjust. McKinsey's 2023 Women in the Workplace report reveals that 78 per cent of women facing microaggressions at work engage in self-protective behaviours, such as modifying their speech or behaviour, in an attempt to blend in and forestall negative reactions. This practice is called “code-switching”, explains psychologist Beverly Tatum — adjusting one’s appearance or behaviour to match perceived environmental expectations. Doing so is a means of finding common ground in environments that promote assimilation, but can be detrimental if it requires sacrificing one's identity, cautions Dr Tatum. The brunt of this pressure to blend in falls disproportionately onto women and other minorities. It can be as small as changing your given name in order to assimilate into places where the majority of people don’t bother saying it right. RELEARNING EMPATHY Linguistic microaggressions such as these aren't isolated incidents, but commonplace experiences for minorities. They are not merely surface-level issues; they’re symptomatic of a deeper struggle for inclusion and belonging. Simply put: We’re stifling voices not by silencing them, but by being inconsiderate. We must take proactive steps to educate ourselves and others to identify the subtle ways our language, jokes, and word choices can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and affect marginalised individuals and groups. It's as easy as extending basic courtesy to those in the room — for instance, it doesn’t hurt to explain why we're using a certain language or to avoid using it altogether if some people won't understand. Bad behaviour should always be called out. However, this does not mean enforcing “cancel culture” or aggressively blasting the person to their face or on public platforms such as social media. Instead, \"calling in\" may be more effective, suggests Roses of Peace’s Mohamed Irshad. This means connecting with the person making such remarks in an empathetic manner: “Hey, I know you didn’t mean any harm in what you said earlier, but it made me uncomfortable. Can we talk about it?” If we find ourselves witnessing microaggressions such as these, we should not remain silent bystanders. Speak up more to redress the disparity and damage, especially when minorities may risk their well-being and safety by speaking up for themselves. In ongoing discussions about Singapore's future, it’s clear that we as a society are making strides to become a more inclusive society. However, we still have holistic work to do in many areas. Creating a culture of mutual respect starts with us ensuring that, in whatever rooms and conversations we’re in, all voices are equally heard.

This TODAY senior journalist asks: When it comes to customer service, is basic courtesy not one of the most essential things? By Amanda Yeap By Amanda Yeap Published April 4, 2024 Updated May 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Last week, a conversation between a private-hire driver and his passenger set off a storm of debate on acceptable behaviour between drivers and their customers. In the shared screenshot, the passenger requested that the driver drive up to the sixth-floor carpark of their pick-up venue without specifying why. Then the conversation shifted gears with the driver’s reply: “U handicapped uh?? Go up lvl extra $5 wrong pick up.” The passenger promptly yielded and said they would head down to the pick-up spot. End of conversation? Not quite. “Don’t be self entitle,” tacked on the driver. “We r not your personal driver.” The incident revved up heated responses from the public, which were largely split into two opposing sides: Those who agreed with the driver and found satisfaction in his response, and those who said the passenger was not wrong to ask and that the driver could have worded his reply more politely. ‘SELF-ENTITLED’ REQUEST It’s clear that many in the first camp of opinion are themselves aggrieved private-hire drivers who have met their fair share of demanding passengers. A few comments pointed out that the driver was simply expressing the voices of his peers. Passengers these days are only getting more demanding, and their requests are more unreasonable, they griped. Riders should follow the pick-up rules, they chastised, and stop pushing your luck with overtaxed drivers to go the extra mile for you. Perhaps they do have a point. After all, there have been several instances of out-of-pocket requests from ride-hailing passengers, such as taking a detour to avoid ERP charges, that have made the news. Keeping in mind that publicised incidents such as these are likely just the tip of the iceberg, private-hire drivers in Singapore have good reason to be wary of passengers when they demand something out of the ordinary. ‘RUDE’ RESPONSE Members of the public who sided with the passenger stressed that it was not wrong for the passenger to make an auxiliary request, especially if it was already put forth early on during the booking process. Not everyone could agree on whether the passenger’s request was overstepping reasonable bounds or not — but even so, many disapproved of the driver’s tone as unnecessarily “rude”. If he didn’t want to accommodate the request, he could have simply declined firmly but “nicely”, they said. Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY This is hardly the first instance of an out-of-pocket request from a ride-hailing passenger making the news. KNOWING ME, KNOWING YOU When it comes to understanding each other, it seems like the driver and passenger in this incident were on different lanes. So who’s at fault? On one hand, it’s true that some ride-hailing customers have gotten too used to taking a mile when drivers give them an inch. But then again, is it fair to let a few rotten apples spoil the entire barrel? In the case of this incident, does the driver’s past experiences with vexing passengers warrant such aggressive treatment of all his future customers? Private-hire drivers, like any other service providers, are being hired to render a service to customers. And when it comes to customer service, is basic courtesy not one of the most essential things? However, passengers also need to keep in mind that while private-hire drivers offer us convenience and comfort, they are not at our beck and call. We are customers on the benefiting end of a purchased service. The onus is on us to head to the pick-up point stated in the booking — because that is the agreement we’ve made in purchasing the service. Of course, sometimes we need a little extra help from our day-to-day service providers. Perhaps we’re dealing with an injury, or are travelling with a person whose mobility is significantly limited or impaired (an elderly relative, for example). In such cases, it would be best to explain to the driver, clearly and politely, the need for a special request outside the standard parameters of the booking. That being said, bear in mind that drivers have the right to decline such requests. 'JUST' BUSINESS? In response to queries from TODAY, Grab confirmed that customers are automatically charged extra fees for changes in drop-off locations, but not pick-up, as users are unable to change their pick-up locations once they have booked a ride. Gojek stated that their app allows riders to change their pick-up location even after they’ve been matched with a driver with no additional fees, as long as the new location is within 200 metres from the original pick-up point and before the driver has reached the original pick-up location. It’s not clear which ride-hailing platform this driver was operating on. However, this incident — like the ongoing debate on whether drivers should help passengers with their luggage — is yet another spotlight on the grey areas that remain in the modern age of ride-hailing services. What does “customer service” mean when drivers are no longer directly employed by a company? Does it still matter, or has the proliferation of app-based service purchases rendered such exchanges purely “business”, with no room left for human sentiment? Is it reasonable for drivers to overfocus on the financial benefit in their interactions with customers? Is it acceptable for passengers to put the squeeze on drivers in an attempt to get the most bang for their buck? Until we have the answers to these questions, this incident drives home the point that politeness is not just free, but priceless. Either way, it’s probably safe to say that this particular driver won’t be getting five stars. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Amanda Yeap is a senior journalist at TODAY who wishes we could all be a little more empathetic and kinder to one another. CLARIFICATION: Grab has clarified that for changes in drop-off locations made by the customer after booking a ride, the additional charge is automatically reflected in the app. As for changes in pick-up locations, drivers are not allowed to ask for any additional charges, but they have the right to decline requests if they are unable to fulfill them.

By Brian N. Chin By Brian N. Chin Published April 5, 2024 Updated April 8, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Sleeping with your dog in the same room could be negatively affecting your sleep quality, according to my team’s recently published research in Scientific Reports. We recruited a nationally representative sample of more than 1,500 American adults who completed questionnaires assessing their sleep habits. Overall, about half of the participants reported co-sleeping with pets — defined in our study as sleeping in the same room with your pet for at least part of the night. Next, our research team compared the sleep habits of people who did and didn’t co-sleep with pets. Our analyses revealed that participants who co-slept with pets had poorer sleep quality and more insomnia symptoms than those who did not. These findings persisted even after accounting for demographic differences between these groups. When considering pet type, we found evidence for a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with dogs but no evidence for a negative effect on sleep when co-sleeping with cats. Surprisingly, 93 per cent of people in our study who co-slept with their pets believed that their pets had either a positive or neutral overall effect on their sleep. Although more research is needed, these findings could suggest that most people are unaware of the potential negative effects their pets may have on their sleep. WHY IT MATTERS Most pet owners report that their pets have a generally positive effect on their mental health. Pets can improve their owners’ health in numerous ways during the day, such as by encouraging physical activity, promoting a daily routine and providing love and companionship. However, our study fills an important knowledge gap by indicating that co-sleeping with pets can affect sleep quality. Good sleep is a pillar of health and wellness. Even though pets may have an overall positive effect on mental health, it is possible that some of this benefit may be undermined if they are also causing you to lose sleep at night. Although some people report that co-sleeping with their pets can provide them with a sense of comfort or intimacy, it is important for people sharing a bedroom with their pets to be aware of their potential to serve as a source of nighttime noise, heat or movement that can disrupt your ability to fall or stay asleep. WHAT STILL ISN'T KNOWN Survey-based studies like ours are unable to prove that co-sleeping with pets causes disrupted sleep, although there is some evidence suggesting that this could be the case. One important factor that our study did not assess was whether participants were also co-sleeping with other people like a spouse or child. Previous research suggests that sharing a bed with other people can also affect our sleep and that the mental health benefits of pet ownership could be stronger for people with a romantic partner. WHAT'S NEXT It probably isn’t realistic for most people to just stop co-sleeping with their pets. So, what should someone do to improve their sleep if they already share a bed with their pets? Some expert tips include choosing a mattress that is large enough for you and your pets, washing and changing your bedding regularly, and establishing and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine with your pets. Further research is needed to identify more specific habits and routines that pet owners can adopt to ensure a good night’s sleep when sharing the bedroom with their pets.

A TODAY journalist puts forth this theory: It’s because when it comes to opinions about Singapore, we all care very much, whether we care to admit it or not. By Renald Loh By Renald Loh Published April 8, 2024 Updated May 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn When are Singaporeans at their most patriotic? No, not on the 9th of August. It’s anytime a non-Singaporean has the gall to make a bad comment about our country. Recently, a travel vlogger named Nina Gerhards posted an Instagram reel lamenting that our precious clean, green city-state was boring, and that she would never travel here again. Ms Gerhards’ video clocked in at barely three seconds in length, and she didn’t speak a word in it. Instead, she offered only a caption of slightly under 100 words (and eight #hashtags) as elaboration, before inviting her fellow netizens to join her in the comments for a good-natured discussion: “What do you think about Singapore?” Boy, did we take her up on that offer. 'BORING' IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER? In a matter of days, the video racked up more than two million views and hundreds of comments — the most ‘liked’ of which was a cordial smattering of unpublishable expletives, coupled with a polite suggestion that she shouldn’t have come in the first place. Clearly, our collective buttons had been pushed. Many Singaporeans leapt to defend our Little Red Dot with long, elaborate essays on the country’s merits (i.e., we’re safe and it’s easy to get around), and recommendations on where she could go to turn her unfavourable opinion on its head (i.e., anywhere but the well-trodden tourist spots). Some in the same camp voiced their displeasure with far less tact and far fewer words. With Singapore being an island almost 500 times smaller than our immediate neighbours, they derided, was she expecting mountains, rivers, and sprawling wildlife amidst vast green plains? On the flip side, there was a substantial number of people who agreed with the vlogger. Singapore is boring, they declared. Singapore is expensive. Singapore is a lifeless concrete jungle. It’s a country not too dissimilar to the image of a rich man’s soulless playground depicted in Hollywood flicks like Crazy Rich Asians, they said — that’s why so many of us eagerly await the holidays and our own travel adventures to escape the mundanity of a society that prioritises work over fun. While I understood both points of view, I couldn’t help but wonder why this seemingly innocuous post managed to spark such heavy and heated reactions. As far as I can tell, Ms Gerhards wasn’t being nasty or disrespectful, nor was she deliberately trying to incite a riot (although whether the post was designed as clickbait is another matter). She merely cited an opinion — and we see far more controversial and arguably crappy ones on the Internet every day. “Singapore is boring”: Haven’t we heard that before? Raj Nadarajan/TODAY In response to travel vlogger Nina Gerhards' post, many Singaporeans leapt to defend our Little Red Dot with long, elaborate essays on the country’s merits. On the flip side, many chimed in to agree with her that Singapore is indeed \"boring\" and \"expensive\". Perhaps the most grievous accusation the vlogger made that both camps wouldn’t have been happy with was that our food “wasn’t even delicious”. But even then, going off her social media pages, Ms Gerhards is German. Someone born and raised on the other side of the globe having a different cuisine preference is hardly a cardinal sin. So, in a sea of hot takes across the world wide web, what was it exactly about this one that quickly became the talk of the town? THE BEST DEFENCE ISN'T ALWAYS A GOOD OFFENCE I think the answer has been staring us straight in the face: It’s because when it comes to opinions about Singapore, we all care very much, whether we care to admit it or not. Whether you think “Singapore’s great” or you’re firmly on team “Singapore sucks”, we inherently and instinctively know more about our country than a visitor on a three-day visa does. The post going viral in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The fact that so many of us jumped so heartily into the fray — either to highlight our strengths or to point out our weaknesses — just means we’re passionate. What I do find problematic is lack of civility in the town square of public reactions. When we resort to pointed personal attacks, does that not only serve to drive home the message that we are not a welcoming bunch? What does it say about us when our hostility — not always so thinly veiled — results in her feeling a need to turn off her comments section? I get it: When you put any hint of an opinion out on the Internet, you should expect to get flamed, cancelled, and everything in between. If you can’t take it, don’t dish it out. But when it comes to a post talking explicitly about Singapore and its merits and demerits, do we really want to perpetuate a culture of reactionary resentment? The urge to rush to defend that which we love is only human nature. But in an era where opinions on social media sprout up more frequently and randomly than pimples on teenagers, perhaps it’s wise to leave some be, rather than poke at every single one.

There is no magic timeframe for parents to introduce their children to news and current affairs, says this early childhood education expert — however, it is important that we consider not just the age, but the maturity and understanding levels of the individual child. By Elise Waghorn By Elise Waghorn Published April 9, 2024 Updated April 9, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn While much attention has been drawn to the detrimental impact of violent video games on children’s developing brains, there has been relatively little discussion regarding the negative effects of news and current-affair programmes children are exposed to. When people consume news and current affairs, it’s hard to escape tragic events, from natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and events that include loss of human life. But do we stop to consider what distressing media is doing to our kids? HOW CHILDREN ARE AFFECTED Research undertaken by the Audience Research Department of the Netherlands Broadcasting Corporation found young children who are exposed to news and current affair programmes can be affected so much that they start viewing the world as a scarier place . Research was undertaken through random telephone interviews with 537 Dutch children, with 48.2 per cent of respondents stating they had a fear reaction to watching adult news. The study found children aged between 7-12 were most afraid of interpersonal violence and natural disasters such as fires, accidents and other disasters. Researchers from the study even found children’s symptoms are like a trauma response — including intruding thoughts (memories that pop into a child’s head, nightmares, repeated discussion around events), avoidance (refusal to talk about news events, or to participate in school activities) and changes to arousal and reactivity (increased irritability and anger outbursts, difficulties in concentrating). EVEN SUBTLE EXPOSURE NEEDS TO BE MONITORED Even when children are playing in the background, if adults have the news on, children can be listening in. Children under the age of seven might not understand the content, which can cause confusion, therefore raising worry and anxiety. This is because children under the age of seven do not have the brain function to mentally manipulate information, and can’t see things from another point of view. Older teens, meanwhile, generally gain much of their news content from the Internet and social media, meaning some parents are not aware of how much, or what, they are exposed to. However, due to their age, they are able to have a greater understanding of different perspectives. GETTING THE BALANCE RIGHT According to psychological therapist Annie Gurton, different age groups require different strategies when it comes to consuming news and current affairs: Children under the age of seven may perceive televised events as live occurrences, leading them to believe traumatic incidents are recurring when they see repeated broadcasts. They are likely to be greatly disturbed by images depicting suffering, crying, or violence. Between seven to 12, children tend to grasp that news reports convey events that have already taken place. They are increasingly capable of empathising with victims, and may get anxious about the safety of themselves and their family when encountering distressing stories. Teenagers aged 13 and older tend to exhibit heightened emotional responses to distressing events, often experiencing fear and deep concern for their and their family’s safety. They may project such events into the future and worry about potential risks. However, they are also capable of reasoning and understanding statistical explanations, which can provide reassurance and alleviate their anxieties. There is no magic timeframe for parents to introduce their children to news and current affairs, however it is important that we consider not just the age, but the maturity and understanding levels of the individual child. However, we do know it’s important for children to take a break from the coverage. Setting a viewing limit of 30-60 minutes before encouraging children to get up and do something else is important. CHAT ABOUT IT A perfect opportunity to support children to know more about the world, without exposing them to the potential downside of the news, is to teach them about why you need to censor their viewing. This can help teach children to regulate their emotions, by expressing themselves when they see things that are upsetting. This might include empathising with young children under the age of seven by saying something like: “I know you really want to watch the news, but some media can report events that are not safe for you to hear.” For an older child, it could be: “I am happy for you to watch the ‘good news’ stories but other events that are televised we need to watch together.” The Raising Children Network, an Australian government-funded parenting website, has some fantastic tips for parents of school-age children when it comes to distressing news events: 1. Turn off and take a break This might mean allowing families 30 minutes to catch up on the main headlines, but then getting up and doing something else. 2. Age-appropriate information Children will cope better if they have age-appropriate information given to them. For example, during fire season in Australia, Australian parents might talk to their children about how due to the extreme heat, the ground gets very dry, resulting in an increase of fires. This is why there are total fire ban days to reduce that risk. 3. Talk to your children Explain, at an age-appropriate level, what they have watched and allow for open communication about what has happened. Allow them to ask questions and reflect. 4. Monitor your children’s reactions to the news Ask them how they’re feeling and share how you’re feeling.

By Jake Pitre By Jake Pitre Published April 11, 2024 Updated April 11, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn A growing cohort of TikTok influencers have begun building platforms by promoting passive income to their followers. Thousands of users regularly share their expertise, tips and advice for how their followers can, theoretically, achieve the same level of passive income without lifting a finger. One influencer claimed to have tried \"about every side hustle that exists\" before landing on print-on-demand as the most profitable source of passive income, which she says makes her \"six figures as a teenager\". During the Covid-19 pandemic, interest in passive income surged. The passive income subreddit has nearly half a million members and the #passiveincome hashtag on TikTok has 1.2 million posts and billions of views. In the wake of the pandemic ending, many have lost faith in the labour market, believing it to have reached a point of no return. Given the current state of the economy and governmental policy, it’s unsurprising that so many are lured by the appeal of passive income. The middle and working classes have seen the same opportunities afforded to their parents and grandparents evaporate, leaving them dreaming of financial stability without the means to achieve it. Amid unprecedented levels of income inequality, there is a growing recognition among workers of the uncertainty of the labour market and the need to think differently about financial security. But passive income might not be all it’s cracked up to be. 'FREED FROM WORK'? According to a 2022 survey in the United States, a significant portion of Gen Z get their financial advice from either TikTok (34 per cent) or YouTube (33 per cent). They see influencers sharing their successes (and very rarely their failures) and are motivated to try their strategies out for themselves. Various passive income subcultures have emerged, from finance bro hustle gurus to young women peddling money-making credit card schemes to their followers. Many influencers pushing passive income schemes describe it as a way to \"earn while you sleep\", suggesting that once you put in the initial work on a certain generating enterprise, it will essentially make money for you. As research I conducted with sociologist Karen Gregory has shown, this has been further literalised by livestreamers on platforms like Twitch. These streamers draw in more viewers and attention by livestreaming themselves sleeping, as fans donate money, promote their content and buy emojis or other perks throughout the broadcast. This signals a desire to be \"freed from work\", because \"to sleep on stream is to put aside and obscure the preparatory work that goes into it and benefit from the market through complete bodily passivity\". For us, then, these sleep streamers seem to embody the logical endpoint of passive income as the ultimate dream of this moment under digital capitalism. ALWAYS BE GRINDING The idea of passive income is often glamourised, but the reality is that many of these ventures require significant effort. In many cases, the work that goes into side hustles or alternative income streams is incredibly laborious, from handling the logistics and costs of dropshipping (the purchasing of cheap goods to re-sell them at a profit) to the creation and selling of online courses about making passive income. Indeed, the understanding of what passive income is has transformed wildly, from what the US Internal Revenue Service describes as \"activities in which you don’t materially participate\" to re-appropriating terms like \"leveraged income\" to refer to maintaining Airbnb rental properties as being somehow passive. Raj Nadarajan/TODAY The idea of passive income is often glamourised, but the reality is that the work that goes into side hustles or alternative income streams is incredibly laborious. While many critics have correctly pointed out the false promises that permeate the financial wisdom within these online subcultures, we must carefully consider the cultural and economic forces underwriting this shift. Some of it is surely good old-fashioned aspirational content and marketing, as journalist Rebecca Jennings wrote in a March 2023 article for Vox. “In short,” she wrote, “it’s the feeling that our primary aim as people is to make our lives as effective and efficient as possible.” In other words, the “always be grinding” mindset. As a result, the concept of participating in multiple income streams to protect one’s self from financial vulnerability is re-framed as not only strategic but passive. Sure, you can break up your labour into different entrepreneurial paths, but you can also, ideally, start them up and then let them go without much maintenance. Let the money flow. A NEW GILDED AGE? Get-rich-quick schemes are nothing new, and the ones currently being shared by “finfluencers” are typically rife with pitfalls, from a complete lack of regulation or accountability, to blurring lines between regular social media content and advertisements — not to mention the way users are expected to take influencers at their word for how much they make through passive income. Only 20 per cent of Americans make passive income, and almost entirely via dividends, interest or rental properties (although whether rental properties count as truly passive income is still up for debate). Canadian numbers are harder to come by, but Finance Canada estimated 83 per cent of taxable passive income was held by individuals in the top 1 per cent income range in 2017. This makes sense. The classic Wall Street notion of passive income — investing in the right stocks or index funds or owning property and having the rental checks prop up your livelihood — persists. Nevertheless, in a new gilded age defined and structured by wealth that is passively inherited or transferred and rarely distributed, the rest of us can’t help but take notice of a platform economy waiting to be exploited — and why not? The belief that one’s self worth is their net worth turns us all into enterprising would-be success stories, grabbing at a way to monetise what we can, while we can. For many, this means racing to seize opportunities before they vanish.

Samuel Woo/TODAY Companies making moves to charge consumers for plastic carrier bags are being accused of attempting to price-gouge everyday Singaporeans by charging them for plastic carrier bags, but what are we missing in our rush to rage out against them? New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Carrier charges from the likes of BreadTalk and Skechers have Singaporeans up in arms about unfair burdens and greenwashing concerns. But what this shows about us is that despite recent progress, says a TODAY editor, we still have a long way to go when it comes to environmentalism. By Ng Jun Sen @SenToday By Ng Jun Sen Published April 12, 2024 Updated May 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn “Save the Earth, kindly bring your own flask/container”, read a laminated sign at a drinks stall that I frequent near my workplace. Plastered next to it was a handwritten line of text devoid of the same politeness in the sign, and seemed to be added almost as an afterthought: “Takeaway plastic cup plus 20 cents.” I duly paid for the levy to go with my kopi, which came with an added bitterness of having forgotten to bring along my reusable mug. It’s a 15 per cent markup — but hey, at least I have coffee. Ever since Singapore launched the mandatory disposable bag charge for most supermarkets last year, I have perhaps been conditioned to accept that there is a cost to leaving my foldable tote bag or thermos flask at home. Yet, if you’ve been on the Internet in recent months, you might think that my reaction was unjustifiably mild. When BreadTalk, the makers of chicken floss buns, decided to slap a 10 cent charge on each disposable carrier bag from April 1, many Singaporeans were predictably outraged . Noting that this applies to the large plastic bags used to carry a collective basket of buns, and not the individual plastic wraps that keep the chicken floss from flying everywhere, people cried “fowl” at the hypocrisy of the move. Many accused these of being moves to price-gouge everyday Singaporeans, as though all of us are innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire between consumerism and environmentalism. It then emerged that American shoe company Skechers also decided to slap a 50 cent charge for canvas bags, after one netizen posted a picture of a receipt with the purported charge claiming that she wasn’t informed beforehand. The company later clarified that the customer was, in fact, aware of the additional charge before payment, and had the closed-circuit television footage to prove it. CASHING IN ON CLIMATE CONCERNS? But the proverbial horse had bolted by then and the criticism against the two companies came fast and furious. “Daylight robbery,” said the original poster who first flagged the Skechers episode on a Facebook group for complaints. “Cheapskate company,” said another. Profiteering claims aside, several wondered if Singapore's government-sanctioned mandatory bag charge in supermarkets gave all businesses a blank-cheque opportunity to essentially raise prices. Why can’t the company cover the costs, asked one person? Is it “greenwashing” when consumers are the ones shouldering the price of businesses’ own green initiatives? Ng Jun Sen A laminated sign at a drinks stall near the writer's workplace that reads: \"Save the Earth, kindly bring your own flask/container.\" Plastered next to it was a handwritten line of text: “Takeaway plastic cup plus 20 cents.” On the other hand, there was another camp of commentators that agreed with the rationale for charging for disposable bags, but differed on how it is implemented. A few wanted to go further in trying to end single-use plastics, suggesting that companies incentivise those who bring their own containers by offering them with discounts. A few also wanted the plastic bag fees to go to green causes. Heck, just ban plastic packaging completely, they said — even the smaller ones used to wrap individual pieces of fruit or bread. But this group of netizens also pointed out how the naysayers of carrier bag charges tend to forget that it is a choice whether or not to pay the fee. CHUMP CHANGE FOR REAL CHANGE? It’s a plain fact that most of the concerns flagged about the mandatory carrier bag charge are solved when the individual has a personal food container or a carrier bag on hand. Of course, bringing along a bag with you everyday is something that requires a habitual change — which comes back to why a mandatory bag charge is adopted for supermarkets in the first place. It is, practically speaking, a policy designed to gently prod consumers towards opting for reusable bags and to get them thinking about the plastic waste that they are generating. Earlier this year, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu told Parliament that large supermarket operators have observed around a 50 per cent to 80 per cent drop in the number of disposable carrier bags used by consumers since the minimum charge came into force on July 3, 2023. What the outrage over BreadTalk and Skechers demonstrates is that despite recent progress, the nationwide endeavour to shift habits and inculcate a mindset of reducing one’s environmental footprint is still in its infancy. The outrage over BreadTalk and Skechers demonstrates that the nationwide endeavour to shift habits and inculcate a mindset of reducing one’s environmental footprint is still in its infancy. Beyond BreadTalk and Skechers, there will be more retail as well as food and beverage outlets that will implement such moves. If that is the case, and if our collective and instinctive reaction is to continue to blame others instead of trying to relook at one’s own habits, then we still have a long way to go. CORPORATE BAGGAGE Reading between the lines of the consumer outcry, it’s also clear that fears over corporate greenwashing are driving this lack of belief in the global goal of cutting waste. It causes people to suspect the motives behind such initiatives instead of questioning their own role in these efforts. This is why at the end of the day, businesses should ensure that any carrier bag charges they impose must primarily function as designed: A nudge to consumer behaviour, instead of a flat charge on any plastic use. For instances where people can't be realistically expected to use their own bags for reasons like hygiene, the charge shouldn’t exist, because there is nothing to nudge them towards. When buying a greasy burger at a food stand, for example, it is unfair to expect people to pay for the takeout box. It may not be feasible for people to bring their own food containers, either. How many people leave the house in the morning already knowing what they will be eating that day? But businesses that disregard these and charge for packaging under the guise of green causes will quickly learn that there will be pushback. Ultimately, any business that forces customers to pay for plastic packaging is a net loss for the environment as well as the customer’s pocket. People are free to take their business elsewhere after all. Just don’t be too quick to bag on the idea of plastic bag charges just yet.

By Diana Tolmie By Diana Tolmie Published April 15, 2024 Updated May 6, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn See the word “musician” on a resume and you might not immediately think “stellar employee” or “exceptional leader”. Perhaps the word evokes the image of a rock star, in trouble for chucking a television out of a hotel room window. Or else someone struggling along in life, who should have picked a “real job”. But is there more to the profession than meets the stereotype? It is well known many musicians work simultaneously in arts and non-arts roles, often to create some income security. Less understood is just how well the extensive skillset developed in music transfers to a non-arts, professional workplace. My nationwide survey sought to find out. I began by conducting 15 in-depth interviews with musicians simultaneously working dual-careers — one in music, and one somewhere else. The preliminary findings, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, showed dual-career musicians have a plethora of distinctive workplace skills that had been enabled by their musical education and experience. This was verified by their non-musician co-workers. The discovery sparked an ongoing second stage of research, investigating the experience of a larger group. These include: dual-careerists musicians who have exited the profession musically-educated individuals who never pursued a music career. With 165 respondents so far, the emerging results are significant: Music education and experience lays the foundation for high levels of future aptitude in a range of workplaces. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT One of the most powerful traits instilled by a music education is a deep sense of professionalism. Eighty-five per cent of survey participants identified the trait as the skill that most influenced expectations of themselves and others, and the quality of their work. A common industry saying about rehearsal reflects this attitude of consistency and punctuality — “early is on time, on time is late, and late is left behind.” Other notable skills included autonomy and self-direction, resilience and perseverance, and creativity. Participants attributed the development of these strengths to the disciplined and focused attention required to learn music, and the intrinsic motivation needed to practise and perfect an instrument over a long period of time. This is increasingly relevant in an age where screens and social media steal our concentration and cost employers’ productivity. Pexels Survey participants attribute the development of certain strengths — such as resilience and perseverance — to the disciplined and focused attention required to learn music. Another key trait identified was creativity, which may reflect findings that the musically trained have more neuronal matter, and therefore increased brain activity. Interviews with non-musician colleagues showed that out-of-the-box thinking was particularly prevalent among jazz musicians, singer-songwriters and composers. IT TAKES A WHOLE ORCHESTRA TO PLAY A SYMPHONY Participants unanimously said ensemble work — playing in bands, chamber music, orchestras and so on — has contributed positively to their workplace team dynamics. As one respondent put it: \"It taught me how to be part of something bigger than myself.\" Experiences in music translated to a greater appreciation of diversity and inclusivity, exceptional leadership and deep listening skills, and the ability to manage “difficult” conversations respectfully within a team. Respondents said an ongoing passion for music improved their mental health and workplace resilience. Unsurprisingly, their non-musician co-workers reported better workplace morale and an infectious positive energy from their musical colleagues. GROWTH MINDSET All respondents reported a healthy relationship with failure — experiences in music had taught them to remain curious, embrace learning and “fail forward” while owning errors. This attitude directly enhances one’s ability to upskill in a non-music careers, something many respondents have had to do. Eighty-two per cent of the exited and dual-career musicians had re-accredited, and 71 per cent admitted to “learning on the job”. Their live performance experiences cemented their ability to work under pressure in a variety of situations — public presentations, deadlines, project management. To them it was a no-brainer: “The show must go on.” Pexels Research indicates that an ongoing passion for music improves workers' mental health and workplace resilience. Co-workers’ perceptions further verified the musicians’ transferable skills, suggesting they possessed high professional values, a strong work ethic, high intelligence, willingness to learn, and the ability to take the initiative. Survey respondents work in a much greater variety of fields than you might expect, including: health science and academia building and engineering business and finance law technology government transportation administration and religion. Many also hold leadership positions. Economically, these findings suggest having a musician on the books may be linked to increased productivity, innovation, and profitability. LESSONS FOR EDUCATORS AND POLICYMAKERS The skills of the musically educated are relevant to far more than just the arts. Employers and recruiters need to respect and appreciate the professional contributions of the musically trained. But the ongoing decline in school music programs and nominal music teacher training, as well as a shift in tertiary training focus to science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the expense of the arts, suggest we’re heading the wrong direction. Including a well-informed understanding of music skills in repositories such as National Skills Passport would be a big step forward. So would ensuring all school children have access to proper music education, and that school leavers are not discouraged from pursuing further music training. Who knows, when the next pandemic comes, it could be a musician who designs the next life-saving vaccine.

An economics expert asks: Is excessive competition impairing cooperation, making us collectively worse off? Or conversely, will a lack of competition blunt the drive for excellence and hinder progress? By Terence Ho By Terence Ho Published April 16, 2024 Updated April 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Over half (55 per cent) of workers in Singapore lack trusted relationships in the workplace, making them far more likely to report feelings of isolation than those with such relationships, reported health tech provider Telus Health in its Mental Health Index last month. Observers pointed to a competitive work environment as a contributor to isolation and burnout. As Singapore strives to be a competitive nation, competition permeates workplaces, schools and every aspect of life. At the same time, we seek to build a more inclusive, caring and compassionate society, a vision that resonates strongly among Singaporeans, as revealed in last year’s Forward Singapore exercise. Are these two objectives in tension, perhaps even inconsistent? Or can they be somehow reconciled? These are questions particularly pertinent to young Singaporeans as they seek success and fulfilment in a fast-changing society. Is excessive competition impairing cooperation, making us collectively worse off? Or conversely, will a lack of competition blunt the drive for excellence and hinder progress? Rather than view competition and collaboration as two ends of a continuum along which we must find an elusive equilibrium, it may be more useful to think about when competition is desirable and when it is more likely to be debilitating. This depends on the type and context of competition — specifically, whether competition enlarges or shrinks the collective pie. COMPETITION AT SCHOOL The competitiveness of Singapore’s school system has driven our students to excel academically, outperforming their peers in other countries. At the same time, there is increasing recognition that an overly competitive, exam-focused system may take a toll on students’ mental health and self-confidence, and may even undermine the love for learning. The Ministry of Education has in recent years underscored that learning is “not a competition” — it should be about personal growth rather than relative positioning. Hence, the PSLE aggregate score has been replaced by broader achievements “bands”, while mid-year examinations have been scrapped at all primary and secondary levels. However, exams remain relevant both as a yardstick of progress as well as an objective means of allocating students to schools and courses. Some element of competition is unavoidable because of limited places in popular courses and institutions. Ideally, motivation to learn and improve should come from within, but it often takes a dose of extrinsic motivation to get students to apply themselves to the task. Raj Nadarajan/TODAY The competitiveness of Singapore’s school system has driven our students to excel academically, outperforming their peers in other countries, says the author. Competition is valuable when it spurs us to improve ourselves, but not when it is socially wasteful. For instance, a higher education “arms race” benefits no one if people chase qualifications not for better skills and knowledge but merely for prestige or to signal their ability to prospective employers. COMPETITION AT WORK AND IN SOCIETY Likewise, there is a need for an appropriate blend of competition and cooperation in the workplace. Employees vying for promotion and performance incentives are encouraged to give their best at work. However, competition taken too far undermines cooperation, which is necessary for the success of any department or organisation. While organisational culture and needs inform the intensity of competition among employees, good leadership can strengthen teamwork and collaboration so that a team is greater than the sum of its parts. Wherever possible, we should seek win-win outcomes rather than zero-sum competition. Singapore’s tripartite collaboration among unions, employers and government is a case in point. Rather than just contend over the division of the pie, unions and employers work together to grow the pie through training and productivity efforts. Sharing of gains and pain between workers and management during good times and bad helps to strengthen trust. There are instances, of course, where competition is the point in itself. Sports is one example of zero-sum competition that propels athletes to excel and generates thrills and spills for spectators. Still, sportsmanship is important, and players and supporters on both winning and losing sides can take satisfaction from a fairly contested, well-fought match. In politics, competition among political parties can improve government responsiveness and accountability to the public, but excessive partisanship can divide societies and render them dysfunctional. Respectful, constructive political competition — in short supply across the world today — is much needed for the future of governance in democratic states. COMPETITION AMONG FIRMS For a strong economy, competition among firms is a must for both efficiency and growth. A tenet of classical economics is that market competition, under the right circumstances, results in an efficient allocation of resources across society. The gains from competition are not limited to efficiency in the static sense; over time, competition can also spur innovation and progress. Firms may develop better products or services to steal a march on the competition, while scientific and technological rivalry could generate breakthroughs and innovations. Antitrust or competition laws are therefore critical to prevent firms from using market power to stifle competition or undermine the public interest. However, competition may sometimes work against the interest of consumers. For instance, competitive bidding among local telcos for English Premier League broadcast rights led to higher costs for consumers, prompting the authorities to introduce the Cross-Carriage Measure in the pay TV market in 2011. Adobe Stock Firms may develop better products or services to steal a march on the competition, while scientific and technological rivalry could generate breakthroughs and innovations, says the author. There are also clear benefits from cooperation among firms. For instance, firms may collaborate on training to build up skilled manpower for their industry. Shared facilities and resources can lower costs and improve productivity. The government has also encouraged Singapore companies to “hunt as a pack” to seize market opportunities abroad. COMPETITION AMONG NATIONS Beyond Singapore, there are strong indications that unbridled competition between nations states subtracts much more than it adds. Geopolitical rivalry is stoking tensions and undermining cooperation on common challenges such as climate change, transnational crime and disinformation. Trade restrictions, economic “decoupling” and technology bifurcation are already duplicating supply chains and shrinking the collective pie. Around 3,000 trade-restrictive measures were imposed around the world last year, nearly three times that in 2019. A report by the International Monetary Fund suggests that global economic fragmentation could cost the global economy up to 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Without effective international institutions to set limits on nation-states, perhaps other countervailing forces are needed — whether influential multinational corporations, global causes such as the climate agenda or other allegiances that can unite people across borders and temper the increasingly zero-sum competition among nations. RECALIBRATION NEEDED A thoughtful recalibration of competition and collaboration is needed across the domains of school, work, industry and politics. Some forms of competition, such as those leading to greater effort and innovation, are clearly more beneficial to society than other forms. Competition should be recognised and even encouraged for the value it can bring — but where it becomes excessive or dysfunctional, it should be dialled back with appropriate laws, norms and nudges. Within the community of nations, there is an urgent need for new models and mechanisms of cooperation.

As more people are diagnosed with ADHD and other types of neurodivergence, recognition and understanding of their strengths and challenges can only be good for businesses in the long term, says this clinical psychologist. By Dougal Sutherland By Dougal Sutherland Published April 17, 2024 Updated April 17, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn There has been a rise in the number of people diagnosed with “neurodivergence” in adulthood over the past decade. As many as 8 per cent of adults globally could have some form of neurodivergence. Neurodivergence is an umbrella term that typically includes autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific learning disorders (SLD) — sometimes referred to as dyslexia. The rise in these diagnoses when people are already in the workforce presents a challenge for employers. Business owners can be left wondering how they can support neurodivergent employees without causing issues for the wider business. 'CHILDHOOD' DIAGNOSES NOW PART OF ADULTHOOD Historically, diagnoses were predominantly made in children , with the view that people “grew out” of them as they developed into adults But research over the past decade indicates the majority of people with these conditions continue to experience symptoms throughout their adult life, albeit in different ways to childhood. Understanding neurodivergence is underpinned by the view that ASD, ADHD, and SLD reflect differences in how a person’s brain is “wired” rather than being an underlying “disorder”. This changing view appears to have increased awareness of neurodivergence. It has also reduced the stigma associated with it, leading more people to seek support as adults. A limited understanding of gender differences in the way neurodivergence is expressed, as well as limited access to psychological and psychiatric assessments in the public sector, have likely contributed to significant numbers of people missing out on childhood diagnoses. Many are now seeking assistance in adulthood. NEURODIVERGENCE IN THE WORKPLACE This rising tide of adults seeking to better understand their differences — and potentially seek treatment — has presented challenges for businesses and employers. But employers need not fear hiring those who are neurodivergent. Viewing neurodivergence as a difference rather than a disability contributes to an inclusive workplace where people’s strengths are recognised and celebrated. Some people with ADHD, for example, work very effectively in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines and rapidly changing content, such as journalism. People with ASD often have very specialised areas of interest that, if matched to the right work environment, can lead them to be experts in their fields. Adobe Stock Viewing neurodivergence as a difference rather than a disability contributes to an inclusive workplace where people’s strengths are recognised and celebrated. But it would be naive to say neurodivergence doesn’t bring with it some challenges for individuals and their workplaces. A person with ADHD may appear quite disorganised to others (and to themselves), and at times “put their foot in their mouth” through impulsively saying something they haven’t fully thought through. Those with ASD often report challenges in navigating social relationships at work, or may have particular sensory sensitivities (finding the general hubbub of open-plan offices anxiety-provoking, for example). They may struggle to process large amounts of written or verbal information, resulting in confusion and anxiety. BUSINESSES NEED AWARENESS Businesses and organisations looking to support neurodivergence in the workplace should initially focus on increasing awareness and understanding among leaders and managers. Managers need to work with individual staff who have self-identified as neurodivergent to understand and implement what is needed to support them. There may be some very practical steps that can be taken, such as having designated low-stimulus areas, providing noise-cancelling headphones, or understanding how best to communicate clearly and simply with an individual. Some staff may wish to take up psychological support via their workplace to help them develop skills in areas they find difficult. Perhaps the worst thing an employer can do is overlook neurodivergence as being present in the workplace. Ignorance, whether wilful or not, will lead to inaction. That said, it would also be a mistake for an employer to unilaterally refer a staff member for an assessment of suspected neurodivergence. To suggest someone is neurodivergent and requires a psychological assessment may lead to personal distress and potentially breach employment law. Employers should also be aware of the lengthy and complicated pathway to an adult diagnosis, due to factors such as lack of clear adult diagnostic criteria and shortage of trained clinicians. They can support staff in this process by allowing flexibility in work hours to attend specialist appointments, or even funding access to assessments in the private sector. The rise of awareness about neurodivergence mirrors the rise in awareness of mental health conditions in the workplace generally. Although this increased visibility can be confusing for some staff and organisations, recognition and understanding of neurodivergence can only be good for businesses in the long term. Helping people operate to their full potential by understanding their strengths and challenges will ultimately lead to thriving and productive workplaces.

By Tania Nagpaul By Tania Nagpaul Published April 18, 2024 Updated April 19, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn In Singapore, the uttering of words with the deliberate intention of wounding the racial feelings of a person is an offence under Section 298 of the Penal Code, punishable with imprisonment of up to three years, a fine, or both. Yet, uses of racial slurs continue , particularly against members of the Indian ethnic minority . Every time such an incident makes it to national news, I feel a sense of violation and betrayal. As a member of this minority group, I do not need to be on the receiving end of racialised hate to experience, indirectly, the hurt and rejection inflicted upon the actual victims for the way they look. Members of dominant groups often perceive conversations about these events to be difficult, sensitive and high-risk. As such, it is common for the collective response that follows such incidents to be for everyone — including the victim — to behave as though nothing has happened, and carry on with no acknowledgment of the injustice that transpired. But what if we all didn’t pretend to be unaffected and indifferent to such events? On my own part, it would certainly make me feel less alienated to know that my friends and co-workers do not condone racialised hate or discrimination. Rather than avoiding discussion of such incidents, tackling them directly opens up space for healthy and meaningful exchange of perspectives, enabling individuals from dominant and marginalised groups alike to confront their inhibitions and create a shared climate that is psychologically safe, whether in a professional or social setting. Here are three action points for supporting those negatively impacted by the use of racial slurs and other mistreatment. EDUCATE YOURSELF Upon witnessing the use of racial slurs towards members of one’s community or receiving racial slurs directly, the lack of intervention or action from others can often lead to members of under-represented groups feeling alienated or even betrayed. Therefore, it’s important for each of us to first educate ourselves on the experiences and challenges faced by marginalised groups (such as Malay Muslims and/or the LGBT+ community) routinely affected by racial slurs and other forms of hate speech. Practice empathy by asking yourself these simple questions: “How would I feel if someone spoke to me that way? What would I need from those around me in order to feel less alone?” Seeking out articles, podcasts or op-eds by members of marginalised communities can also help with perspective taking. These self-education efforts will help us to “model” supportive behaviours that centre victims in such incidents, rather than our personal sense of comfort. BREAK THE SILENCE Well-intentioned individuals may wish to speak up, but may be incapacitated by the fear of saying something wrong or overstepping sensitive boundaries — “What if I offend them by bringing it up? What if not being a minority means that it’s not my place to speak up?” In such scenarios, a simple acknowledgment of the incident would get the ball rolling. iStock We must first educate ourselves on the experiences and challenges faced by marginalised groups routinely affected by racial slurs and other forms of hate speech. By initiating the conversation and sharing feelings of vulnerability with friends and colleagues of different identities and backgrounds, we can encourage each other to face our inhibitions and to openly show support and empathy. In any conversation regarding incidents of racial discrimination and hate speech, the focus should be on affirming the experiences and perspectives of our friends and co-workers from victimised communities, and showing respect and appreciation for them as valued members of society and the workplace. BE REAL Trying to follow conventional tips and guidelines on what to say to friends and colleagues from marginalised groups can feel “fake” and contrived. “Is it weird if I ask ‘How are you’?” you may wonder. “Am I forcing it?” Hence, it is very important that we be authentic in our interactions — that is, to present ourselves authentically and thoughtfully. But how do we do this? Rather than worrying about what would be the “appropriate” language to use, focus on being open and genuine. Rather than striving to be right or wrong, strive to place the hurt individual’s perspective and needs at the forefront. When our words, thoughts, actions and non-verbal gestures are in sync with one another, we will be able to convey the message of solidarity and appreciation to our co-worker successfully. Finally, it’s critical to remember that each person may differ in their support needs. For some, simple acknowledgment and reassurance may be enough; others may prefer to focus on work or other topics as a productive distraction or coping mechanism. Some may find an open conversation with their friends and colleagues more suitable, to help them navigate complex emotions and thoughts. Placing the focus on those who have been hurt or negatively impacted ensures that we show support and allyship without being overbearing, and provide them the time and space they need to heal and restore.

Samuel Woo/TODAY Singaporeans can’t seem to agree on whether the opening up of requests for flexible working arrangements is a step forward, backward, or even sideways.

The new guidelines on flexible work arrangements aren’t meant to be a perfect solution, but a starting point that forces employers to come to the table and listen to their staff. Whether that conversation results in a win-win outcome depends on both sides' willingness to give and take, says this TODAY deputy editor. By Melissa Lee Suppiah By Melissa Lee Suppiah Published April 19, 2024 Updated May 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn As a kid, I asked and pleaded and begged my mum for a puppy. Whenever she ran out of ways to dodge the question, she’d bring out the big guns: “Ask Dad.” She was confident that Dad would say no, and that would be the end of it. But what happens when Dad doesn’t say no? On Tuesday (April 16), a tripartite workgroup unveiled the Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests . In these guidelines, the group — a collaboration between the Ministry of Manpower, National Trades Union Congress and Singapore National Employers Federation — stipulates that all Singapore firms should set up processes to receive and handle formal requests from employees for flexible work arrangements. This should come as no surprise, with the overwhelming majority of young adults continuing to prefer remote or hybrid working arrangements even as we put the Covid-19 pandemic in the rear-view mirror. In 2023, most of Singapore’s Gen Zers (69 per cent) and millennials (70 per cent) said they would seek out job opportunities elsewhere if their current employer were to mandate full-time on-site work, according to Deloitte research. As vocal as workers have been about not returning to the office full-time, employers have been just as vocal about wanting them back in the workplace. In October 2023, LinkedIn reported that seven out of 10 leaders in Asia-Pacific believed their companies would be “forced to wind back progress” on flexible working. After spending all of 2023 circling each other like two rival boxers in a ring, it seems the two opposing sentiments are finally coming to a head — and Tuesday’s announcement may have just rung the bell. POINTLESS, USELESS, HOPELESS Members of the public poured into the stadium to place their bets, alternating between hollering support and huffing displeasure. A large group quickly arrived at the conclusion that the move was, ultimately, a toothless display — a whole lot of fanfare over no real, tangible change. Workers can now request flexible work arrangements — so what? Companies can still easily reject such requests, they said. Big deal. Adobe Stock Members of the public poured into the stadium to place their bets, alternating between hollering support and huffing displeasure at the new scheme. Many took it upon themselves to remind others that employers are “not that nice”, with several voicing fears and expectations that workers will likely rue the day they attempted such requests (or have such requests granted) when their performance appraisals are negatively affected, not to mention their salaries or bonuses. Even if this comes out to something, said some, such a move will still be “unfair”. After all, not everyone would be able to benefit from such flexibility, including service and frontline workers. Equality fails again. BABY STEPS? Another camp of spectators threw their support behind the move. It may not be much, they said, but at the very least, it’s a step forward for better worker welfare in Singapore. For young adults, access to flexible work arrangements makes it easier to take care of ageing parents and relatives as well as kids. For older folks, flexibility enhances their ability to find and keep jobs as they age. Yes, non-office workers may never have this privilege or possibility, but that’s all the more reason to count your blessings, advised this group. Many also said that opening up such requests could be a step towards addressing other chronic issues in Singapore — for instance, nudging the nation’s minimum annual leave requirement up from the current seven days. TRUST ISSUES At first glance, the new guidelines seem like a classic case of splitting the baby. As the saying goes: “No one is very happy, which means it’s a good compromise.” We can’t seem to agree on whether this is a step forward, backward, or even sideways. But what if it’s not a step in any direction at all? Really, the new guidelines are an opening: A door to more conversations between employers and employees about how to re-evaluate and improve both business performance as well as worker welfare. So maybe the real point we’re all missing is this: What does it say about Singapore work culture that this door wasn’t already open to begin with? Interestingly, a decent chunk of responses chose to warn of \"abuse\" of flexible work arrangements on both sides of the aisle: Greater freedom means employees will go MIA or slack off; greater remote access and looser structures means employers will make staff work after hours and on public holidays. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Crowds in the Central Business District on April 26, 2022. The new guidelines are an opening: A door to more conversations between employers and employees about how to re-evaluate and improve both business performance as well as worker welfare, says the author. Clearly, the issue is not really about who's in the office and when. It’s about trust between bosses and workers. And that trust seems to have broken somewhere along the way — more inimically than we’ve all realised. TRUST GOES BOTH WAYS Repairing that trust starts with recalibrating our base view of jobs and work. At the end of the day, nobody wants to do badly at their job and nobody wants their company to fail. Of course, there are always occasional exceptions to the rule, but broadly speaking, we’ve all got that Majulah Singapura mindset — we all want better outcomes for our careers and businesses, as well as ourselves. We’re all on the same side. It’s not a zero-sum competition. It's give and take, not win or lose. But the simple truth is this: Expecting any one single move, no matter how big or small, to be a one-size-fits-all fix for all our problems will never turn out well. These guidelines aren’t meant to be a perfect solution, but a starting point that forces employers to come to the table and listen to their staff. Whether that conversation results in a win-win outcome depends on both sides' willingness to give and take. To be honest, I never got that puppy. Dad said no. But I did get to give a pretty cool five-minute presentation on why I thought I deserved that puppy — a presentation that earned me two hamsters. In the public debate on flexible working arrangements, we don’t have to split the baby, and we definitely don’t have to throw it out with the bathwater.

By Elsa T Chan By David Hekman By Elsa T Chan & David Hekman Published April 22, 2024 Updated April 22, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn When we consider how leaders get to the top, we might think of somebody like Jordan Belfort, the millionaire stock broker portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in The Wolf of Wall Street. And humility is probably not the word that comes to mind. However, Belfort’s rise was followed by a fall (he ended up in jail). For those who want to reach the top and stay there, it may be best to stay humble. Humble leaders express their humility in three dimensions. They view themselves accurately and acknowledge their limitations. They show appreciation for their followers’ contributions. They are also open to ideas and feedback. When leaders show all three attributes, they are considered to be humble. So how can humility help those who want to reach the top? We studied how humble leaders can become more promotable and found that they accomplish that by growing others in what is known as a “humility route”. Human capital theory suggests that employees’ value can be enhanced by investing in their knowledge, skills and abilities. It’s not only important for employees, it also creates value for organisations. Using human capital theory, our research shows that humble leaders focus on the learning and growth of their followers. By doing so, they also create human capital value for themselves in the process. Humble leaders tend to engage in more informal mentoring, and through that they gain influence and power in terms of promotability. They provide career guidance to their proteges and help them to prosper. But at the same time, their engagement in learning also boosts their own human capital. In such a developmental relationship, humble leaders gain respect, prestige and prominence, and they gather a group of followers with high human capital. Adobe Stock Humble leaders view themselves accurately and acknowledge their limitations, show appreciation for their followers’ contributions and are also open to ideas and feedback. This enhances their status in the organisation. It’s a win-win for leaders, their followers and the organisations they work for. Our study used survey data from a sample of 610 leaders who worked in 18 industries and across 21 job functions. The leaders’ direct followers, peers, immediate bosses and superiors reported back on the leaders. The measures in the survey included the leader’s humility, informal mentoring, status and promotability. We found that humble leaders earn higher status and enhanced promotability through engaging in mentoring behaviours. So if you want to be more promotable, it may pay to stay humble. A MORE SUSTAINABLE PATH TO THE TOP But why are some leaders so arrogant if there is a “humility route” to success? A great deal of evidence shows that humble leaders outperform arrogant leaders. And yet, many leaders at every level have a hard time admitting mistakes, praising followers’ strengths and being teachable. The arrogant, narcissistic, bullying and dominating Wolf of Wall Street stereotype may be the most common and immediate route to the top. After all, this sort of behaviour can lead to quick wins which are are easily noticed and glamourised, reinforcing the stereotype in popular culture and media. But while this path can offer short-term gains, it often lacks stability. Even the famed Renaissance Italian political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli — a well-known figure of dominance strategy — ended up being tortured, imprisoned and then exiled. In contrast, humility offers a more stable and less visible route to success. Humble leaders typically achieve their status through fostering growth in others, engaging in mentoring, and creating a network of highly capable, loyal and enthusiastic followers. Adobe Stock A great deal of evidence shows that humble leaders outperform arrogant leaders, say the authors. This network in turn provides the humble leader with high status, leading to them being viewed favourably by superiors. But such an approach may not grab attention or fit the dramatic narratives preferred by media, making it less visible to the public. The key difference lies in the nature of success each approach brings. Dominance may lead to a rapid ascent but is often accompanied by volatility. Humility, on the other hand, cultivates a foundation of strong relationships and a positive reputation, leading to a more stable and enduring success. This explains why the Wolf of Wall Street stereotype persists, despite the proven benefits of humility in achieving long-term leadership success. HOW TO FOSTER HUMILITY Expressing humility helps leaders earn career success as they increase human capital, which is vital to organisations. In recent years there has been a growing interest in humility in the workplace, particularly among leaders. It’s time to re-evaluate perceptions about the value of humility in leadership. You can show more humility as you lead. You can evaluate your own limitations and be sensitive to them. You can try to admit them by saying, “This is something I could do better.” You can also put your focus on the followers, acknowledge what they have done well and give them positive feedback. You can also be more open to feedback yourself and consider your followers’ ideas more. There are a few ways that organisations can cultivate humility. They can build the perception that expressing humility is valued. They can also organise training programmes that develop humility in leaders and consider including humility as part of performance evaluations. And lastly, they can encourage feedback on humble behaviours, promote informal mentoring and foster a culture of humility that centres on learning. That way, they can develop groups of employees who focus on the “humility route” to career success.

By Adrian Vincent By Adrian Vincent Published April 23, 2024 Updated April 23, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn The Life Insurance Association in Singapore in 2022 reported a critical illness protection gap of 74 per cent or S$579 billion for economically active Singaporeans aged between 20 and 69 in Singapore. The protection gap refers to the difference between the level of financial protection one has and what one actually needs to safeguard against potential risks. Being underinsured means one is not sufficiently covered for unexpected events, leading to unwanted financial challenges. Closing this gap to ensure sufficient protection for medical emergencies, accidents, and unforeseen expenses is crucial for bolstering one’s financial security. More urgently, this gap is increasingly widening across generational lines. In a 2023 survey on Gen Z insurance trends by FWD Singapore, more than 68 per cent of Gen Z respondents indicated that they do not have coverage for critical illness events such as cancer, stroke, and heart attacks. INSURANCE TRENDS ACROSS GENERATIONS Every generation is shaped by different backgrounds, circumstances, values and perspectives — differences which are reflected in their insurance needs and attitudes as well. The post-war generation (or baby boomers), generally aged above 60, largely tended to focus on retirement planning and healthcare, necessitating life insurance for estate planning and long-term care coverage. Generation X, in their 40s and 50s, strive to balance multiple financial responsibilities, requiring coverage for mortgages, dependents, and potential long-term care. In contrast, when it comes to millennials and Gen Z, there is a clear shift in insurance needs and priorities. Millennials, in their late 20s to early 40s, seek financial security for growing families, emphasising affordable health insurance and financial protection for debt obligations. Adobe Stock Millennials, in their late 20s to early 40s, seek financial security for growing families, emphasising affordable health insurance and financial protection for debt obligations. Gen Z is the largest global generation, with its members reporting growing spending power and changing spending habits, according to Nielsen’s data. However, being teens and young adults in their early 20s, they are still only at the outset of their financial journeys. As such, they gravitate towards digital platforms and accessible insurance that lay the groundwork for their financial protection journey. As these emerging generations become significant consumer markets, insurers face a critical question: How can they better understand and cater to the changing needs of modern young adults? CHANGING ASPIRATIONS AND NEEDS More and more data show that young adults prioritise meaningful work, flexibility, and autonomy over stable, linear career paths. In Singapore, a growing number of Gen Zs (46 per cent) and millennials (37 per cent) have taken on either a part- or full-time paying second job, showed research by Deloitte in 2023. This signifies a broader, more adaptable approach to work, that may encompass remote work, side hustles, and entrepreneurial pursuits. There are also diverse needs and different segments among young adults — from fresh graduates navigating their first steps into the job market, to gap-year takers in search of meaningful experiences, to those seeking conventional and unconventional routes to wealth accumulation. This shift not only transforms individual professional journeys but also impacts considerations in insurance coverage. Notably, research indicates that early retirement is becoming an increasingly popular concept among millennials and Gen Zs. Financial planning and investment patterns for this group of consumers will likely need to be altered accordingly. A GROWING GAP Many young adults might not see the urgency of this need now. Having had less time to gain and accumulate wealth at their age, insurance is not often top of mind for Gen Zers and millennials. Adobe Stock Having had less time to gain and accumulate wealth at their age, insurance is not often top of mind for Gen Zers and millennials. The everyday young adult often navigates life with a sense of invincibility, believing that insurance coverage is a concern for older generations or unforeseeable emergencies. However, this perception overlooks the potential risks and financial burdens that can arise from unexpected events. While youth may bring a sense of vitality and freedom, it also comes with its own set of responsibilities, including the need to protect oneself against unforeseen circumstances. Initial responses from Gen Z respondents and feedback from younger clients and customers outside of the survey suggest that they largely perceive insurance as complex and costly. As such, efforts to inform and educate younger generations more widely and effectively are vital, to bridge the growing gap between their evolving life goals and insurance needs. Some financial services providers have begun launching programmes to introduce basic financial literacy concepts to students. Educating younger children and teens on simple approaches to money management and building a strong financial foundation is an important first step. Young adults need to understand that proper coverage extends beyond just health insurance to manage medical expenses. Other types of coverage, such as home insurance, motor insurance, and even life insurance, play significant roles in safeguarding one's financial well-being. Investing in insurance at a younger age often translates to lower premiums, as insurers typically consider younger individuals to be lower-risk. This means that securing insurance coverage early provides assurance, but it can also be a financially savvy decision in the long run. A few insurance providers are already offering simpler, more straightforward and affordable plans that can form the foundational blocks of critical illness plans, some starting from just S$20,000 sum insured. Opting for a smaller coverage is always recommended to having no coverage at all. CLOSING THE INSURANCE GAP As millennials and Gen Zers navigate flexible career paths, re-evaluate professional and financial goals and contemplate early retirement, it may be tempting to overlook the overarching importance of insurance coverage in their everyday lives — but the reality is that insurance serves as a crucial safety net for unforeseen events and financial hardships. By prioritising adequate coverage, they protect themselves and their assets, but also pave their own way for a more secure and resilient future. Tackling the responsibility of insurance today ensures that they can confidently navigate whatever challenges tomorrow may bring, allowing them to focus on pursuing their goals with peace of mind. On insurers’ part, more effort and resources need to be channelled towards tailoring approaches to meet the needs of young adults. The shifting values and aspirations of this demographic signal a need for providers to innovate and align with these evolving demands. Making moves to stay adaptable now will not only serve the current populace but also help to safeguard the coverage needs of future generations.

By Ruth Knight By Ruth Knight Published April 24, 2024 Updated April 24, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Have you ever felt sick at work? Perhaps you had food poisoning or the flu. Your belly hurt, or you felt tired, making it hard to concentrate and be productive. How likely would you be to tell your boss you were unwell and had to go home? While employees would probably tell their boss about a stomach upset, many who menstruate and feel unwell as a consequence every month, are unlikely to talk about their difficult periods. Especially at work. This was confirmed in our recent study of 247 students and workers who have periods. We found only 6.7 per cent would be honest with their employer about why they had to leave work or stay at home. Additionally, 87 per cent of those surveyed — 96 per cent identified as women — felt their period often interfered with their work or study. One respondent told us, “I would sometimes just say I wasn’t well and needed to work from home to be near a bathroom. I would let people assume it was gastro.” Another said, “I do not feel comfortable giving this as a reason to miss work as it feels like an excuse despite living in chronic pain.” The topic of menstruation is unquestionably still on the taboo list. And it is also clearly affecting the workplace. The good news is we are starting to see initiatives aimed at making workplaces more inclusive for people who menstruate. Having access to free period products seems to be paying off as our research found 84.6 per cent of employees said it makes them feel their workplace cares about them and reduces the likelihood they will leave work due to their period. One respondent explained, “Periods can be hard. I once bled through my clothes at work and had to leave. It was so stressful and humiliating. Free period products could just change someone’s day.” This is encouraging, but also suggests accessible products alone won’t lift the taboo and support a menstrual-inclusive workplace. More needs to be done. Adobe Stock The good news is we are starting to see initiatives aimed at making workplaces more inclusive for people who menstruate, says the author. HOW TO CREATE A MENSTRUAL-INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE 1) Recognise the impact of periods Our study identified people who menstruate regularly experience physical symptoms such as abdominal pain (94 per cent), backache (82 per cent), and headaches (82 per cent) before or during their period. They also describe emotional symptoms such as anxiety, fatigue, depression and irritability. One respondent said: “My cramps are so painful they make me feel physically sick — as though I will throw up. So I don’t like being out of the house because I can’t stand up straight.” And another: “My period increases my general level of anxiety in class, at work, and in all other situations. It can cause me to be acutely anxious during my classes and work, and I struggle to concentrate.” To avoid feelings of humiliation, shame and discrimination, people with their period often mask and hide symptoms. When this happens, employees report being less engaged and productive. By empathising with menstruators who are impacted in a wide variety of ways, organisations can support and empower them to look after their general and menstrual well-being. 2) Become an inclusive leader Inclusive leaders treat menstrual health as a justice and human rights issue that is collectively important for individuals and the organisation. These leaders recognise people with their period should be supported, so they talk to them about cultural and practical ways the workplace can make them feel safe and allow them to manage their period with dignity. This might mean providing free period products or offering menstruators flexible breaks and work hours when having their periods. Inclusive leaders recognise some people may need paid menstrual leave. 3) Normalise discussions about menstruation Inclusive leaders go further than practical strategies, they create a period-positive environment by challenging stigma and discrimination. They normalise conversations about menstruation, and ensure people who menstruate feel heard, supported and respected. They offer education and training to dismantle the menstrual taboo in workplaces, and replace it with a culture that embraces menstrual wellbeing. Ultimately, to make our workplaces equitable and inclusive, we must be willing to talk about menstruation openly and honestly and learn about the impact it has on employees. Only then will workers feel able to talk about what supports their health needs.

Moving out as a young single is undoubtedly costly, but why do Singaporeans judge others for how they choose to manage their own money as well as their mental and emotional well-being? A TODAY deputy editor explores the question: What if it’s not really about numbers in bank accounts, but about our ideas of “failure”? By Melissa Lee Suppiah By Melissa Lee Suppiah Published April 25, 2024 Updated May 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn For young Singaporeans, the Covid-19 pandemic brought on several changes to life as we’d known it. Most learnt to adjust to remote work — some irrevocably so . Many picked up new hobbies and interests that pre-pandemic busyness had kept them from pursuing. And some realised that they just can’t live at home anymore. This week, TODAY’s mental health series Gen Zen explored the difficult dilemmas young singles face in deciding whether or not to move out of their family homes due to strained relations. Youths and mental health experts weighed in on how living independently can affect one’s well-being in both positive and negative ways: No one to bug you with endless nagging and questions, thumbs up! No one to help you with housework and chores, thumbs down. Given that young singles choosing to move out has long been a contentious topic in Singapore, perhaps it’s only natural that the column sparked a debate from readers and other members of the public. NO MONEY, NO TALK Despite the mental health benefits laid out by both this piece as well as many others already published on the subject in recent years, many felt that for young Singaporeans, the cons of moving out still far outweigh the pros. Let’s be real, these people said, there’s no way any amount of mental or emotional gain can make the financial cost of living independently worth it — especially as this cost continues to climb amid economic squeezes and pressures. Even if you manage to make enough to afford rent, said these dissenters, you may not actually be ridding yourself of the stresses that accompany living at home. They pointed out that in your desperation to escape friction or tension with your family, you could end up saddled with bad housemates or, even worse, a “nightmare” landlord. Same problem, different roof. Adobe Stock Some dissenters said that even if you manage to make enough to afford rent, you may not actually be ridding yourself of the stresses that accompany living at home. All in all, this camp advised: Don’t make the mistake of giving up long-term financial gains for short-term peace of mind. IT’S MY LIFE (AND IT’S NOW OR NEVER) Even so, many others stood by the intangible benefits of living away from one’s family. It’s not only about getting away from unhealthy or toxic situations, many said, but to gain some healthy growth and independence that would better prepare and ease one into full adulthood. A few rebutted the potential problem of difficult roommates or landlords by highlighting that such situations are useful opportunities for acquiring and practising various skills required for living harmoniously with others — undoubtedly valuable knowledge for Singaporeans, given the way our country’s land constraints require most of us to live in close quarters. Some shared how moving out early had greased the wheels on their progression into living with their current partners or spouses. Several added that living away from one’s family also makes it easier to have a love life — an unquestionable boon for Singapore, surely, given youths’ rising rates of singlehood and the downward slide of our birth rate. MENTAL CALCULATIONS Moving out is a big change for anyone at any stage of life. For this — and for any other major decision, really — the scale on which we balance the pros and cons aren’t weighted the same way for everyone. For some, the benefits of moving out far outstrip the costs. For others, the price of freedom and independence will never be justified. Even so, why do we feel the need to judge others for how they choose to manage their own money, as well as their mental and emotional well-being? One Reddit user, AivernT, put this forth as the underlying “crux” of the entire debate: “We are so conditioned to hyper-optimise our finances to hit every milestone that any deviation appears to be considered a failure.” From this perspective, what we’re really worried about isn’t numbers in bank accounts. It’s about how we internalise our fellow Singaporeans choosing to make what we personally perceive to be a mistake — choosing “failure”. But why is this such a sensitive trigger for us? Singaporeans are well conditioned to avoid and guard against failure. As a small nation with grand ambitions and limited resources, we haven’t had much chance to enjoy a large margin for error, historically speaking. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Singaporeans are well conditioned to avoid and guard against failure, says the author. But now, nearly six decades into independence, our countless achievements speak for themselves. Singapore’s rise-and-grind culture has also earned us a global reputation for unparalleled hustlerdom. Perhaps we’ve done more than enough to earn ourselves a little breathing room. Some space to take a step back instead of letting all that conditioning prod us into deploring each other’s individual decisions, even when we don’t personally agree with the logic behind each one. Retooling the overwhelming instinct to avoid failure at all costs starts with retooling our understanding of what “failure” even is. A couple of responses offered up a new lens through which to calculate the cost-benefit analysis of moving out: Improving one's mental health environment may be a boost to one’s ability to perform far better in the workplace — which, in turn, could drastically improve one’s financial prospects. To one person, renting may be “throwing away money”. To another, it could be a crucial investment not only in their current well-being, but also their future growth. Of course, it’s still important to make wise decisions in life — keeping in mind that “wise” may look different for each one of us.

With the advent of disease-modifying treatments, these things are no longer a pipe dream. Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Jonathan Tiong has Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy. The author, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, says new drugs could greatly improve his quality of life. Even so, he’s in no hurry to take costly medications to which continued, consistent access cannot be guaranteed due to the exorbitant price tag. By Jonathan Tiong By Jonathan Tiong Published April 26, 2024 Updated May 28, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn At this year’s Committee of Supply debate, Nominated Member of Parliament Ong Hua Han asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider extending financial help for patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to access disease-modifying treatments. Such treatments improve patients’ quality of life, but are not full-fledged cures. He cited a crowdfunding campaign by Singaporean games journalist Sherry Toh, who is trying to raise S$375,000 for a one-year supply of the drug Evrysdi (risdiplam), an oral medication to be taken daily. Evrysdi is the only treatment option registered with and approved by our Health Sciences Authority. Another treatment, Zolgensma, is a one-time gene therapy, but must be administered before a child turns two years old. It costs upwards of S$2 million. Children in Singapore have access to Zolgensma on a compassionate use basis. A few have managed to benefit from this drug, following successful crowdfunding campaigns to raise the millions of dollars needed. SMA, which I am also affected by , is a congenital neuromuscular disorder in which the nerve cells that carry messages from the brain to the rest of the body weaken and die, causing progressive muscle weakness. Most patients are unable to stand or sit unsupported. As the disease worsens, problems with swallowing, speaking, and breathing occur. SMA is a rare disease — according to a 2023 MOH statement, there are only about 40 to 50 patients in Singapore. It is also terminal . THE CASE FOR DISEASE-MODIFYING TREATMENTS I’ve never been one to sugarcoat or romanticise my condition. The fact is: It sucks. I can’t do many things most people would consider routine, like moving around independently or eating delicious food. Even the simple things that I can do for myself take huge reserves of energy, and I find myself tired and in discomfort all the time. Because of SMA, I will never experience many wonderful facets of life: A rollercoaster ride; a night out drinking at the bar; having a kid and teaching him to play football. With the advent of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), especially when administered to a young child who is still in the early stages of the disease, these things are no longer a pipe dream. Children in the United States who were given Zolgensma as newborns several years ago are now running around schoolyards with their friends — something that would have been unfathomable a decade ago. Closer to home, Ms Toh noted on her campaign page that her ability to swallow water improved after she received a complimentary three-month supply of Evrysdi on a compassionate basis from manufacturer Roche. Before, she would have taken about 52 seconds to drink a given amount of water. After starting on the drug, her time decreased to 16 seconds. ADDING UP THE COSTS DMTs have changed the SMA landscape forever. But every discussion on DMTs in Singapore runs into the same issue: Cost. In the US, insurance covers the cost of DMTs and allows ready access to those who need it. Here in Singapore, though, patients have no option at the moment but to figure out a way to pay the exorbitant price tag on their own. Adobe Stock Every discussion on DMTs in Singapore runs into the same issue: Cost. Here are my rough calculations: If I want to get treated with Evrysdi, I would have to work my white-collar office job for more than five years to save up enough for a single year of treatment. This is why I’m ambivalent about even starting on the drug, which relies on taking consistent doses in order to sustain its effects. What happens if I no longer have access to this costly drug? The joys and freedoms, and the improvements to my quality of life it would bring — all those positive effects would go away in an instant. It seems really cruel to put myself through that. And so, I’d rather not commit to the treatment while financial cost is still the biggest stumbling block to my continued access to it. I don’t enjoy having SMA — but after 26 years, I’ve come to terms with it. I’ve become used to living my life while working around the ever-increasing limitations my disease places on me. I’m in no hurry to plunge myself into a situation where I have to constantly worry about running out of money to buy medicine, or be subject to the trauma of finding myself robbed of my newfound strength and independence all over again. FACING THE REALITIES Don’t get me wrong: I’m not saying I don’t want medicine that could better my life. If our health insurance system suddenly became like the US’s overnight, and I could access Evrysdi with little worry about the price, I would take it in a heartbeat. But the reality is that our system is set up completely differently. It’s not my intention to “fix” our system with this piece — plenty of other highly qualified writers and experts have suggested solutions to the affordability problems facing rare disease treatment. For example, the Rare Disease Fund (RDF) could potentially help SMA patients afford DMTs, if SMA gets added to the list of diseases it covers. But even if so, the RDF has a very small quantity of funds available to it, and a growing quantity of demand on these funds. SMA is just one of a whole constellation of rare diseases out there, and treatments for all of them are just as expensive, if not more so. It would of course be ideal to help every patient who needs support — but we don’t live in an ideal world. Funds are finite. There are only two options: Be selective in who gets help, or get more funds. Getting more funds is, in turn, a whole other can of worms because of opportunity cost. If the government allocates more money to the RDF, that’s money taken away from some other use or need, like education or assisting the elderly or cushioning the impact of inflation on the lower income. At the governmental level, I trust Singapore is doing the best it can for the RDF. That brings us back to being selective in who gets help. Unfortunately, allocating resources is, by nature, a zero-sum game. Let me put it this way: If the RDF has to choose between subsidising treatment for me or a young child also suffering from SMA, I’d rather medical help goes to the kid. Adobe Stock Stopping his SMA progression at a much earlier stage means he will retain more of his physical abilities and strength. He will have his whole life ahead of him, giving him a much longer runway to do lots of amazing things that I can only dream of. A REASONABLE STEP FORWARD While we figure out how to address the funding gap, one intermediate step I do wish for the authorities to consider is to make SMA testing more prevalent in Singapore. Many developed nations screen newborns for SMA through a simple blood test. According to Novartis, which developed Zolgensma, 45 per cent of babies in Europe are tested for SMA at birth. This compares to 44 per cent in Australia and an impressive 80 per cent in Taiwan. Early detection of SMA is crucial in the age of DMTs because the sooner the patient begins treatment, the better the outcome in the long run. Besides rolling out more widespread newborn screening for SMA, I’d like Singapore to dream even bigger: Introduce routine carrier testing for the gene that causes SMA. This is also possible through a simple blood test. I understand from my relatives’ experiences with starting a family that, currently, couples are advised to get tested for the gene only if they have a family member with SMA like me. But with one in 40 people carrying the SMA gene, there are actually many people out there who are blissfully unaware. All it takes is for two of them to procreate, and their child will have a 25 per cent chance of having SMA. I personally always encourage my newly married friends to ask for the test before having kids. If couples are aware of their carrier status before they try for a baby, they will be in a better position to make an informed decision on whether to go ahead with reproductive efforts or consider alternatives such as adoption. NO EASY ANSWERS Ultimately, SMA is a devastating disease which incurs costs that go far beyond the financial. The physical and psychological toll it takes on patients and their families cannot be quantified. Making any decisions regarding SMA — or any other rare disease for that matter — is a highly personal affair involving a complex interplay of each individual’s dreams, fears, beliefs, values, and life circumstances. There are no easy or correct answers, but with the knowledge we have available to us at any given moment, we can make the decision that feels right for us, and then make the best of it.

By Gayathri Haridas By Gayathri Haridas Published April 29, 2024 Updated May 6, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn As artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI continue to rapidly evolve and reshape our lives, safeguarding our children has never been more critical. Earlier this year, the chief executives of five major social media companies testified in a US Senate hearing on Big Tech and the online child sexual exploitation crisis, sparking a heated debate on child online safety and mental health. Currently, researchers vary in their views on the effects of technology use on children's well-being. That said, what we do know is that social media use and mental health problems in youths have increased in tandem; more and more studies are finding links between the two in several contexts. What all experts seem to agree on is that tech industries and governments alike need to work to create better online environments for our children. In the midst of all this, the integration of AI into various digital platforms and services has introduced new complexities to the online safety landscape. As parents, guardians, and caregivers, we need to understand both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI and equip ourselves with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate these complexities effectively. Here are some ways in which AI complicates things: Enhanced personalisation : AI algorithms used by popular streaming platforms analyse user data to recommend content tailored to individual preferences, potentially exposing children to inappropriate material beyond parental control. Deepfakes and manipulated content : AI enables the creation of hyper-realistic deepfake videos. This allows malicious actors to fabricate content that can deceive and harm children, such as fake celebrity endorsements of dangerous or illicit materials or altered news clips spreading wrong or misleading information. Algorithmic bias : Social media platforms employ AI algorithms that may inadvertently amplify biases against certain demographics, resulting in discriminatory content distribution and fostering negative perceptions among children based on factors like ethnicity, gender, or socio-economic status. Privacy concerns : AI-driven smart toys and devices, such as smart speakers and interactive dolls, often collect and store children's personal data without robust privacy protections, raising concerns about unauthorised access, data breaches, and potential exploitation by third parties for targeted advertising or identity theft. AFP As parents, guardians, and caregivers, we need to understand both the potential benefits and risks associated with AI and equip ourselves with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate these complexities effectively, says the author. LEVERAGING AI TO ENHANCE ONLINE SAFETY While AI introduces new challenges to online safety, it is also a promising tool in bolstering online safety measures with its advanced algorithms that can swiftly analyse vast amounts of data, allowing for the rapid identification and mitigation of potential threats and harmful content. Here's how AI can be leveraged to enhance online safety for children: Content moderation : Platforms like TikTok and Instagram use AI algorithms to automatically flag and remove inappropriate content, such as violent or explicit videos in violation of their community standards, ensuring a safer browsing experience for young users. Adaptive parental controls : Apps like Google Family Link and Apple Screen Time employ AI algorithms to analyse children's online activities and adjust parental controls accordingly, allowing parents to set limits on specific apps, websites, or screen time based on their child's age and behaviour. Cybersecurity solutions : AI-driven cybersecurity software like CrowdStrike and Halcyon utilise machine learning algorithms and generative AI to detect and block online threats, such as viruses, malware, and phishing attempts, protecting children's devices and personal information from cyberattacks. Digital well-being features : Platforms like Apple iOS and Android devices offer digital well-being features powered by AI algorithms that monitor screen time, track app usage, and provide insights into device usage patterns, helping parents and children maintain a healthy balance between online and offline activities. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PARENTS While AI-driven solutions and regulations can contribute to maintaining online safety, parents and caregivers also need to get closely involved. Here are practical recommendations on how to further enhance your children's online safety: Adobe Stock Parents and caregivers also need to get closely involved to maintain online safety, says the author. Establish open communication : A recent survey by the Ministry of Communications and Information highlighted that parents are not always aware of children’s online gaming activities. It's essential to establish a supportive and open dialogue with your children about their online experiences. Continually encourage them to share what they enjoy about these activities and to ask questions where they’re unsure, fostering an environment where they feel comfortable discussing any concerns or incidents they may encounter. Prioritise digital literacy for the whole family : Digital literacy impacts the necessary skills needed to thrive alongside AI and to be resilient both online and offline. Begin by educating yourself about various aspects of technology, including AI, and best online safety practices. By teaching family members, especially children, about responsible online behaviour — such as respecting others’ privacy and protecting their own, avoiding cyberbullying, and critically evaluating information — they can navigate the online world responsibly and identify potential risks and threats. Co-create rules around usage : Nurture a collaborative approach within your family to co-create boundaries and rules regarding screen time, appropriate content consumption, and online interactions. Rely on expert guidance to create these rules and regularly review and adjust these guidelines as needed to ensure they remain relevant and effective in promoting a healthy and balanced digital lifestyle for everyone. Lead by example : There is mounting evidence that how parents use digital media can have a big impact on their children’s development. Be mindful of your own online behaviours and habits, as children often model their behaviour based on their parents'. Set a positive example as a technology role model by promoting quality tech use for your children. This can involve dedicating phone-free time each day to do activities with your child or choosing online activities together that are educational and enriching, like playing games, exploring videos and tutorials on hobbies such as painting, crafts, gardening etc. Stay informed and engaged: Engage with your children's digital experiences to understand their behaviour, enabling you to monitor any sudden and unexpected changes in mood and well-being. Rather than avoiding new technologies like AI out of fear, it’s important to stay updated on the latest trends and developments, so you can both appreciate their vast possibilities while maintaining safety for you and your kids in this new digital age.

Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Office workers in the Central Business District at Raffles Place on Sept 22, 2021. New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Many companies still draw the line at moonlighting — but what if it actually increases employee engagement and productivity? Here’s why this chief executive allows his staff to take up side jobs. By Yoshihisa Aono By Yoshihisa Aono Published May 2, 2024 Updated May 3, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn One day in 2007, an employee came to me with a bold request: He wanted to take on a side job. My immediate instinct as a chief executive was to refuse. “No moonlighting” was then the norm throughout most of Asia. But when I thought about it some more, I couldn’t think of a strong enough reason. He might have less time to focus on his job, but that’s also true of people with family obligations. More work outside the company might tire him out more and increase the risk of him making mistakes, but no worse than after a heavy night of drinking — should we prohibit all alcohol consumption too? I soon realised that my stance on moonlighting was based not on grounded logic, but on negative stigma already prevalent in working culture. Did I really want to limit this employee’s options for growth and self-fulfilment on these grounds? In the end, I decided to allow it. Since then, side jobs have not only become an integral part of our corporate identity and human-resources policy but also a valuable recruiting tool. A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH WORK Moonlighting is becoming increasingly popular in Singapore, with over 13 per cent of employees participating in it extensively in 2023, reports job platform Indeed. While the primary driver is rising costs of living, other oft-cited reasons include a desire to retire early, learn new skills, or engage in a creative endeavour. Side jobs present a whole host of opportunities for employees. For example, engineers might develop skills they wouldn’t be able to acquire by working only for my company. Content creators can improve their creative abilities by taking on various external writing, filming, or editing projects. Managers can deepen their understanding of business trends by working with startups. All of these are concrete examples I have personally seen. Despite this, moonlighting — while not illegal — is still frowned upon by most employers, and many companies include a clause against it in their employment contracts. Bosses worry about divided loyalty, arguing that a side job prevents employees from being fully invested in their primary job. Someone working multiple jobs can’t possibly be productive in all of them, they claim. These are reasonable concerns. However, given how far we’ve come in the last two decades, they seem to stem from an outdated perception of the optimal relationship between workers and their workplaces. The primary goal of recruitment is hiring competent people who are both willing and able to do a good job. To this end, should employers aim only to squeeze every last bit of productivity out of their employees? Or should they aim instead to encourage their workers to develop motivation to contribute to the best of their ability and compensate them accordingly? The latter approach is proving to be a superior way to guarantee long-term worker engagement. The proof is in my company’s low turnover rate, which hovers around 5 per cent — far below the rate of 15 per cent we were seeing before allowing our employees to moonlight, as well as the global average voluntary turnover rate of 14.5 per cent reported by financial services company Mercer in its Asia-Pacific 2023 survey. EMPLOYEE FREEDOM DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING GOES Allowing moonlighting is not the same as saying employees can do whatever they want. My company’s stance is to allow side jobs, not actively encourage them. Even flexible work environments must have reasonable, common-sense limits. For instance, employees still have to abide by national laws regarding work hours. Businesses would also do well to prohibit employees from simultaneously working for a competitor. There are also more situational limitations which managers and employees must work out together. If someone is struggling with their current workload, can they justify taking on another role elsewhere? In some cases, they may have to reduce their hours or responsibilities — how should this impact compensation? In my own experience, it’s worth noting that most employees are not actually interested in moonlighting: Only around 10 per cent of our staff report having a secondary source of income. However, for that minority, the benefits of moonlighting are undeniable and too often overlooked by employers. As workplace flexibility continues to climb to the top of many people’s career priorities, top talents expect more from their employers. For some people, a “no side jobs” clause may be a deal breaker; for many companies, it may mean shutting out good workers who simply want to cultivate new talents or experience several types of work. THE PILLARS OF AUTONOMY With the global trend of “quiet quitting” set to continue into 2024, employers need to think about how to better motivate employees to show initiative and be self-reliant. In this vein, it doesn’t make sense to impose arbitrary limitations on how they build and enrich their careers. What’s far more important is to adapt an organisation’s culture to better accommodate increased flexibility and worker autonomy. First, emphasise transparency and communication. Open up channels and processes for anyone with a side job to communicate that information with their managers and team members. Openness is key: If employees take time off during work hours, whether for a side job or a private engagement, have them register their absence clearly in shared company calendars or rosters. Second, consider valuing results and output over “traditional” metrics such as hours spent at work. Letting employees select their workstyle and compensating them based on results and market value can offer greater adaptability. Finally, flexibility needs to be supported by the right workplace tools. One of the main reasons we’ve seen a trend towards more diverse workstyles is how far digitalisation and remote work software have come. Side jobs are easier to manage when you don’t have to worry about falling out of the loop in your main job. By enhancing these three elements, companies can redesign their workplace culture where flexibility and adaptability are critical to building a resilient and successful business. It would be unwise to squander talent and opportunities because we can’t stop clinging to the rigid beliefs and practices of the past.

By Nicholas Netto By Nicholas Netto Published May 6, 2024 Updated May 6, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn On Jan 14, 2008, a speeding van skidded and collided head-on with our family car on the expressway. Unable to get out of our vehicle, we had to wait for assistance from the Singapore Civil Defence Force. My parents, in the front seats, both suffered broken bones and other injuries. The perpetrator emerged unscathed, and my parents could see him standing nonchalantly beside his vehicle, speaking on his mobile phone without bothering about their well-being. As for myself in the back seat, the seat belt had kept me safe, but the impact also caused some blood vessels around my small intestines to rupture. This was only discovered during an exploratory laparotomy (like a C-section but done in the old-school vertical manner). I still have the large vertical scar. To this day, I still encounter situations in motor vehicles where panic floods me and I have to grab onto something to calm myself. This happens most often when I book a ride on a ride-hailing service, and private-hire drivers not only speed but also fail to maintain a safe distance from the car in front. Whenever I ask these drivers to “drive slower / safely”, my request is usually met with either a muttering of dissatisfaction and a slowing down for a minute or two before returning to their original speed, or complete dismissal and disregard. THE TAMPINES TRAGEDY Upon hearing of the April 22 fatal accident in Tampines , my initial response was that of sadness, especially as it emerged that two lives had been taken away too soon. At the same time, as in-car camera footages started to surface online, I felt a growing swell of anger about this inexplicable accident which had resulted in the deaths of two people, harm to others, and brought grief to so many in the community. I soon realised that I was so affected by this episode not just because of my own past trauma, but because it could have happened to my children as well. As a parent, you tell yourself that your children will be fine if you equip them with the skills and knowledge to remain safe on the roads. For example, we teach them to belt up in vehicles, and to wait for the green man at pedestrian crossings and look both ways for oncoming traffic before stepping onto the road. The stark truth is that no matter what safety measures and precautions we take on the roads, we are at the mercy of other road users. Unfortunately, many road users do not take this responsibility seriously. I observe speeding occurring daily, oftentimes by heavy vehicles which have the potential to cause more serious harm. It’s also common to encounter drivers that neglect to signal, smoke while driving, or appear distracted either by conversing with a passenger or by using their mobile phones while driving. Nuria Ling/TODAY A traffic police officer uses a Police Speed Laser Camera on an overhead bridge on Feb 22, 2024. A VISION OF SAFE SINGAPORE ROADS What could an ideal future with safer roads in Singapore look like? In an ideal world, we would eliminate speeding completely. All vehicles could come equipped with Intelligent Speed Assistance technology, where traffic signs can automatically ensure vehicles comply with corresponding speed limits through an onboard communication system. In-car cameras could also become standard in all vehicles, and footage of traffic violations synced via cloud to an artificial intelligence-powered analytics program administered by the authorities to detect traffic violations. More crucially, footage of accidents could be obtained directly and not subject to external manipulation or interference. In addition, drivers’ road behaviours could be factored into other aspects of car ownership such as the cost of renewing one’s road tax or insurance, or even increasing the cost of future Certificates Of Entitlement (COEs) for recalcitrant drivers by factoring in a multiple as a “hazard tax”. All these require a whole-of-government approach towards car ownership and road safety, making it more burdensome for road users to behave recklessly. None of these proposed solutions are foolproof or easy to implement — for example, how should non-Singapore registered vehicles be dealt with? — but they strive towards transformational rather than incremental change. WHAT CAN WE DO NOW? New requirements for speed limiters on lorries in Singapore have been announced and will be progressively rolled out till 2027 — a good start, but insufficient. First, all new-imported lorries should have a speed limiter installed; this should be implemented much sooner than the proposed deadline of Jan 1, 2026. All goods vehicles should also have speed limiters, regardless of size. A heuristic could be that if the vehicle has a label with a speed limit, it should require a speed limiter. Such an initiative could have prevented the accident my parents and I were involved in, for example. Our traffic laws should also be strengthened as an effective deterrent against speeding and other hazardous road behaviour. The Traffic Police are increasing penalties for selected offences, but could consider firmer action such as a lifetime ban from driving for cases where lives are lost. Such an option would better factor in the principles of deterrence, retribution and public protection, and serve a stern reminder to all that possessing a driving licence is a privilege that comes with responsibilities. Last, the enhancement of penalties will only be effective if complemented by a consistent enforcement regime, which will require adequate resources. Road users should be encouraged to support enforcement efforts by providing feedback on reckless driving. Currently, the process for submitting traffic feedback is cumbersome and limited by requirements such as file size of submitted videos; it’s also not uncommon for members of the public to receive no response to their provided feedback. Any solution should ideally automate or make easy the ability to enforce traffic laws for both the authorities and community. Such systemic transformations could be costly, but the benefits of safer roads would greatly outweigh the costs incurred. As a car owner, it may mean that I cannot afford another car when my COE expires in future; but as a father, it could also mean that my children do not have to face the risk of grievous harm — or even death. In my view, that is a price worth paying. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Nicholas Netto is a senior lecturer in social work at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.

By Kelly Tay By Kelly Tay Published May 9, 2024 Updated May 9, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn In a bid to scale my parent coaching business, Juicy Parenting, I recently waded into the murky waters of Facebook ads. I had been warned by more experienced marketers that greater exposure via online advertising would necessarily mean greater exposure to online trolls. True enough, barely a week into my Facebook ads foray, I received the following comment from a stranger: “Would never take parenting advice from an Asian.” Based on her profile, she was a Caucasian grandmother from Louisiana, United States. At first, I was in disbelief. Who would say such a thing out loud, much less put it online for all to see? Doesn’t she know that one’s digital footprint can never be wiped off the internet? Once I got over my shock at the blatant racism, however, I did start to wonder: Why does this person have such a negative impression of Asian parents in the first place? What Asian families has she encountered that have led her to believe that we have nothing to offer? A QUICK CAVEAT At this juncture, I want to be perfectly clear: The point isn’t to pit “Western parenting” against “Asian parenting”, nor to start a fruitless argument about which is “better”. Sure, some aspects of Asian parenting — with its typically harsh and punitive approaches — can be improved. But that certainly doesn’t mean Western parenting is perfect, or has all the answers, either. Also, it’s worth emphasising that not all Asian and Western parents are the same. There are many Asian parents who choose not to hit their kids, just as there are many Western parents who reach for the belt and spank their children. The point here is simply to reflect upon myself, my work, and my community, to ask ourselves: How can we completely redefine what Asian parenting can look like in a modern age? Is it possible for us to let go of traditionally harsh and punitive approaches, and embrace evidence-based ones that prioritise connection and mutual respect instead? TIME FOR CHANGE The truth is, there is a lot about traditional Asian parenting that needs to change. For one, we’ve got to stop hitting and caning kids. This is often believed to be a “Western” philosophy — something that works for “them” but not “us”. However, local research — including a 2022 study by Singapore Children’s Society and Yale-NUS College — has shown that childhood beatings are not only ineffective in teaching moral values, they are also consistently associated with increased aggression, poorer emotional regulation, and lower self-esteem. These negative effects often last well into adulthood. iStock Local research shows that childhood beatings are consistently associated with increased aggression, poorer emotional regulation, and lower self-esteem — all of which last well into adulthood. Next, we need to shift our lens when it comes to crying and “negative” emotions. It’s common to hear this advice doled out to new parents: “Don’t give your toddler attention when they cry. Just ignore them — they’ll soon realise it has no effect on you.” But psychologists have long warned that this is not only counter-productive, but also damaging. It could even be tantamount to emotional neglect. US paediatric psychologist Dr Mona Delahooke notes: “Rather than ignoring, it’s best to do the opposite: Pay extra attention to behaviours, and ask the question: How can we help the child to communicate? “When we ignore children, we risk shutting down their attempts to do what we want them to do most: Communicate with us.” Third, it’s time to stop expecting blind obedience from our children. The most well-known example of this can be seen every day, where we meet their curious “Why?” with “Because I’m your father/mother and I said so.” Is it harder to take the time to explain our boundaries? Yes. Will our kids always get it, or be satisfied with our explanation? No. Does that mean we shouldn’t bother at all? Of course not. It doesn’t mean we should lapse into permissiveness, either. The point is to refrain from using dead-end strategies, that wrongly signal to kids that asking questions — or even expressing disagreement respectfully — is a crime. This way, we have a much better chance of raising individuals with well-developed critical-thinking skills and habits. TRAITS TO KEEP At the same time, there’s so much that’s good and timeless about Asian parenting that needs to stay. For starters, long may our respect for elders continue. Those with more experience deserve to be valued by the societies they spent their lives helping to build. We should also continue to uphold our fierce loyalty to family. In a world where loneliness is on the rise across the globe, intergenerational interdependence is a strength, not a weakness. In addition, Asian parents’ deep sense of responsibility and unwavering work ethic must be treasured, as it fuels our willingness to do whatever it takes to give our kids a leg up in life. These strengths are exactly why I’ve always believed that Asian parents have so much potential to be great. But we waste it by continuing to let fear guide our parenting, by believing adages like “不打, 不成才” (which translates to “If you don’t hit your kids, they’ll amount to nothing” — basically, the Chinese equivalent of “spare the rod, spoil the child”). As with anything else, it’s always best to double down on what works, and tweak what doesn’t. Imagine the sea change we’d make to the generations down the line, if we just tried to grow beyond traditional mindsets. BEING FIRM AND KIND As for that internet troll who said she would never take parenting advice from an Asian? Here’s how I responded: “That’s okay, I’m not for everyone! Hopefully your kids break the cycle of making snap judgments about an entire continent of people.” That’s the kind of future I want for my kids: Where they won’t stand for others’ poor behaviour; where they’re able to disagree respectfully; and where they can hold their position firmly and kindly. But that can only happen if we first raise them firmly and kindly, too. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Kelly Tay is a parent coach, the founder of Juicy Parenting and a mother of two.

By Fiona Lee By Fiona Lee Published May 13, 2024 Updated May 14, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Have you turned down invitations to networking events? Or attended a conference only to leave immediately after the scheduled speakers wrap up on stage, so that you can avoid the post-programme mingling? I have. Being an introvert, networking made me cringe and my stomach churn. It made me want to turn and flee — and I often did. For the first 15 years of my professional life, I avoided networking like the plague. On the few occasions I absolutely had to attend a conference or an industry event, I mostly stood around awkwardly, watching some people breeze into the crowded room and effortlessly strike up a conversation with others like long-lost friends. I could never bring myself to approach a stranger — or worse, a group of strangers — and engage in small talk. It felt unnatural and “fake”. Over time, I convinced myself that networking just wasn't my cup of tea. A CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVE Two years ago, I embarked on a big career transition from procurement to user experience (UX) design. To improve at a faster rate, I wanted to meet more UX designers to learn about their experience and to seek feedback on my portfolio. For once, I felt the push to reach out to others in the industry. I knew I had to do something to overcome my discomfort with networking. So, for the first time in my life, I attended a networking event entirely out of my own volition. And I did it alone . My heart was pounding fearfully as I stood by myself and scanned the crowd for a friendly face. I eventually mustered the courage to approach someone — a small business owner pivoting into UX design. We ended up having a great conversation about our respective career transition experiences. It turned out that she was also a user of my agency’s digital platform, so as a bonus, I managed to get some customer insights too. After crossing that first hurdle, I felt more at ease and confident, and it became easier to initiate conversations with the others at the event. At the end of the day, I left the event happy, with a whole slate of new connections. NETWORKING AS A SKILL TO BE LEARNT That day brought me to a realisation: By reframing how I felt about networking, I was able to let go of my self-doubt and insecurities. Instead, I now see networking as just another skill that we can practise and get better at — just like learning a new sport or a new language. I also see how valuable networking can be. It can help you to open new doors, learn something new, or just to make new friends. iStock \"I now see networking as just another skill that we can practise and get better at — just like learning a new sport or a new language,\" says the author. Truthfully, I still feel awkward at the start of each event — but by the end, I always have something valuable to take away with me when I leave. Here are some tips I picked up over time to make networking less nerve-wracking for me. #1: Know your ‘why’ To reduce your social anxiety, go in with a broader objective than purely to “network”. Ask yourself: Why are you attending this event in the first place? Take the pressure off yourself by redirecting the focus to other people or things. For example, I attend events that focus on key topics or feature speakers that I’m already interested in. When I’m going to an event with the purpose of learning something, the “networking” part becomes less of a sticking point in my head. #2: Start with small goals Are you networking in a bid to score a job referral, or to make 10 new connections? If lofty goals such as these seem overwhelming to you, you can always start small. Aiming to make just one new connection can be enough. #3: Make genuine connections Networking can often feel “fake”. It can feel like you’re going around trying to promote yourself to people you don’t know — and that can be extremely uncomfortable for introverts like me. It doesn’t have to be this way. Introverts often excel in active listening, and they thrive in intimate, small settings. Use that strength to your advantage, and seek to make genuine connections. For my part, I strive to approach new connections with a curious mindset: With each new person I meet, I aim to learn at least one interesting thing about them. This makes the engagement meaningful and reduces the discomfort about making “small talk” with strangers for no real reason. #4: Prepare and practise Starting conversations can be daunting for many introverts. One reason for my anxiety was that I was just not prepared enough. I never thought about how I was going to introduce myself, what questions I would ask, and how I would exit the conversation. Preparing and practising beforehand can give you that extra boost of confidence. Over time, it will become more natural and you will find that you don't need so much practice before the event. #5: Go alone This may seem counterintuitive. After all, you’re already anxious about networking. Shouldn’t you attend such an event with a friend or someone familiar for support? Hear me out. In my experience, whenever I go to an event with a friend — especially another introvert — chances are the two of us will end up spending the entire time engaged in conversation with each other. We miss out on opportunities to connect with other people. Going alone pushes me out of my comfort zone, so that I have more reason to take the first step to interact with someone new. GIVE YOURSELF SPACE AND GRACE Let’s say you went out on a limb and attended a networking event alone, doing your best to employ the tips and tricks above. It’s possible that you may still fail to meet anyone new. If you didn’t manage to make any new connections, or if you didn’t even make it to the mingling portion of the event (like I struggled to before), don’t be too hard on yourself. It’s not the end. There’s always another opportunity. Like with learning any new skill, what’s more important is that after each attempt, you reflect on what went well and how you can do better. If you did manage to meet new people, give yourself a pat on the back. Note down what you did to help you achieve that, and think about how you can repeat it or improve further upon it the next time round. As with any skill, the only way to get better and strengthen our confidence is to allow ourselves to practise and learn from our own mistakes.

It was funny to watch this fad play out — Singaporeans even put their own spin on it by asking their partners to peel prawns instead. But it also makes one wonder how much weight we're putting on these touted ideals when we put our phones down. Having grown up in the digital age, I've always been drawn to social media for guidance on everything from career to food, and relationships. With just a tap or scroll, we can easily access bite-sized advice tailored to our specific concerns. In a world where time is of the essence and instant gratification is the norm, the quick fixes offered online are very appealing to modern young adults dealing with relationship dilemmas. But I’ve begun to notice how toxic Internet dating content can seep into our real lives, subtly perpetuating harmful stereotypes and eroding the foundation of healthy relationships. For women, such advice often trends towards glorifying jealousy, fixating on superficial signs like texting habits, and equating love with material wealth. On the flip side, men are fed toxic messaging that discourages vulnerability, pressures them to become dominant “alpha males”, and promotes manipulative tactics like delaying responses to texts. Take, for instance, the catchy mantra-turned-meme: \"If he wanted to, he would.\" It seems simple — if your partner cared about you, he would act accordingly. But people aren’t that simple. There are dangers that come with attempting to streamline the complexities of human emotions and motivations into a binary equation such as this. TRENDING TOWARDS TROUBLE Food-related challenges, such as the quirky “orange peel theory” and the more recent “ketchup challenge” — which entails cleaning up spilled ketchup on camera — are designed to test a partner's devotion through trivial tasks. But can we really judge the strength of our relationships based on such arbitrary acts? Creating unnecessary scenarios just to put our partners on display for public scrutiny and judgement is not only dehumanising but also undermines the trust and respect essential for healthy connection and intimacy. Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY The quick fixes offered online can be very appealing to modern young adults dealing with relationship dilemmas, but we need to be wary of letting such content perpetuate harmful stereotypes and erode the foundation of healthy relationships. It doesn’t help that many young adults are already under implicit pressure to measure the success of many aspects of their lives against what they see on social media. The tendency to compare oneself to others is natural — however, social media amplifies the negative impacts of such comparison, especially among youths who spend a lot of time scrolling through peers' profiles. For young people, repeated exposure to idealised portrayals of love and dating online can create feelings of inadequacy or insecurity, leading to discontent or disappointment in their own relationships. Some of my own friends have gotten caught up in replicating “relationship milestones” to the point where it became all about ticking off certain boxes: Posting perfect couple photos, marking anniversaries in unique, flashy ways, or staging elaborate displays of affection. In chasing these external validations, we risk losing sight of what truly matters: The genuine emotional connection and compatibility we share with our partners. RETHINKING SOCIAL MEDIA’S ROLE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP Popular social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram run on algorithms that favour viral content. Trends that promote sensationalised or exaggerated relationship advice often pick up steam quickly and easily, quickly racking up millions of views. But such content often lacks the depth needed to navigate the subjective nature of human relationships. Snappy catch phrases do well with gaining traction on social media, but don't consider personal struggles, communication barriers, geographical locations, or the fact that everyone expresses love differently. Unsplash Many young adults are already under implicit pressure to measure the success of many aspects of their lives against what they see on social media. Perhaps it’s more useful to view catchy phrases and advice soundbites as food for thought. For example, while TikTok videos of users testing out the orange peel theory saw millions of viewers tuning in, the theory’s popularity seemed to be overwhelmingly limited to girls and women — a group that is typically taught from a young age to prioritise and anticipate others' needs without complaint or concern for our own. Could it be that a seemingly arbitrary request of peeling an orange isn’t showing us if our partner loves us or not, but rather reflecting our own desire for our unvoiced needs to be met? SEPARATING SUBSTANCE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA STATIC In the midst of the noise, how do we discern what's helpful from what's harmful? Here are some tips that I rely on. Firstly, exercise critical thinking. Consider the content's tone and approach: Who are they speaking to — a generalised group of people, or a specific type of individual in a specific type of situation? Are they promoting healthy communication and mutual understanding, or do they rely on popular but trite wisdom, or deceptively simple solutions? Look for sources backed by professionals, such as licensed therapists, or relationship experts with verifiable credentials. I've personally found a couple of accounts that I really resonate with, like @thesecurerelationship and @your.being. They're run by certified psychologists and relationship experts who offer genuine, evidence-based advice. Lastly, never underestimate the power of open communication and mutual understanding in relationships. Regardless of what strangers are saying, the voice that matters most is that of yours and your partner's. Approach conversations with honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to listen. In the real world, a relationship between two persons demands open communication and mutual understanding, not snap assumptions based solely on actions prescribed by strangers or digital trends. Let's leave the oranges and ketchup in the kitchen, and focus on the real, authentic moments that can strengthen our bonds in a healthy way.

Nurjannah Suhaimi/TODAY New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Published May 21, 2024 Updated May 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I should have known right away that something was seriously wrong. The cramps intensified every month. The bleeding increased in quantity. There were moments when, if I walked a little too fast, the world seemed to spin around me. But nothing prepared me for the pains I felt one recent day onboard a train. I thought I would black out from the cramps. I couldn't stand straight. I looked desperately for an empty seat to rest in. I didn’t find one — until the last stop right before my destination station. I took it anyway, urgently needing the few minutes of respite it provided me. Instead of seeking medical help right away, I carried on my way home. It might just be stress, I thought, or a lack of sufficient sleep causing these extreme pains. In hindsight, I wasn’t thinking too clearly. I just wanted to rest. That night, I was rushed to the emergency department for severe abdominal pains. Initial diagnoses of appendicitis and ruptured cysts soon gave way to one: A degenerated fibroid in my womb. It was so big that it had outgrown its blood supply. I had long known that I had fibroids in the womb, and had been making regular visits to the gynaecologist to monitor their growth. Upon further detailed checks, the severe pains which I had experienced were also due to adenomyosis and endometriosis, painful uterine disorders which involve the endometrial tissue of the womb. I was in severe pain despite round-the-clock doses of Arcoxia, a pain and inflammation reliever. Taking the full measure of the situation and the fact that my husband and I had no plans to enlarge our family further, my gynaecologist asked me to consider a hysterectomy. In removing my womb, she promised to preserve my ovaries as there was no medical need to remove them. If she were to remove them, I would enter straight into menopause. Considering my pain and the dire state of my womb, I went ahead with the hysterectomy on May 5. At the time, I thought of it purely as a medical procedure. The pains were so bad that I really wanted to find a solution to ease them. In my mind, this was a purely physical ailment which needed to be removed as soon as possible. Problem solved. However, after the procedure was done, I looked at my clinical discharge summary — and, to my own shock, tears started forming in my eyes. Medical facts stated how bad my womb was, with the enlarged, adenomyotic uterus, numerous endometrial blood clots and fibroids. Strangely, even though such a “bad” part of my body had been removed, I found myself grieving for it. I grieved for the womb which had helped me to sustain two pregnancies and bear two beautiful children. I grieved for the womb which had “failed” to see me through natural menopause. I grieved for a physical part of my being which I had now lost. Was it possible to feel “less” of a woman, having permanently lost my womb and thus the ability to have more children? There were just so many emotions pulsating through me. As I spent time at home recuperating after the procedure, the emotional turmoil continued. I wept. I searched. I prayed. I journalled. I read. I have come to realise that, even though I understood the rationale behind my choice to remove my womb, I needed the time and emotional space to mourn and say goodbye to an integral and dear part of my body. My womb had given us our lovely children. It had fulfilled its task of sustaining life for my babies. Throughout my life, my womb has worked very hard for me — and it had now become medically non-viable to keep within my body. I am thankful. As I emerge from this brief but unexpectedly profound medical episode, I’d like to advocate for two things. First, for my female comrades, it’s so important for you to get connected with a good gynaecologist and undergo regular gynaecological checks. It’s not uncommon for women to feel uncomfortable with gynaecological visits, or to find them unnecessary as they assume such checks are only meant for women who are planning to have children or already have medical issues. Don't ignore even seemingly “small” issues like inter-cycle bleeding, increasingly painful menstrual cramps, or increased bleeding. Especially for women who are planning to have children, make yourself a gynaecological appointment to rule out fibroids and other risks before conceiving, not after having conceived. Thanks to my own kind, reassuring gynaecologist, I was able to feel like I was in very safe hands for such a major surgery. Secondly, let’s strive to normalise conversations and concerns on menstrual concerns. Even in these modern times, I still notice people reacting with visible awkwardness when topics relating to women’s health pop up in everyday exchanges, such as menstrual pains, cramps and bleeding. Women make up half the planet’s population. Menstruation happens once a month to everybody in the world in possession of a uterus who's reached puberty. For a great many of us, it can be deeply uncomfortable and even severely painful. Can we normalise “period leave” for women who might be experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding and find it hard and inconvenient to spend long hours away from home for work? What if we spoke of menstrual cramps and bleeding as if they were like any other physical debilitations and ailments — flus and coughs, for example? How might we care for friends and coworkers undergoing tough menstrual challenges? Could we ask if they need to rest in, need a recommendation for a good gynaecologist, or would like a heating pad to relieve the cramps without fearing crossing archaic taboo lines? For now, as I continue to recover, I am grateful to be able to count on the love of family and friends and the understanding of kind and supportive bosses and colleagues. Within myself, I’m also making peace with this farewell process. I’m learning that it’s possible to embrace both sadness and gratitude, and smile through my tears. Goodbye, my womb. Thank you.

By Larissa Santhana Nair By Larissa Santhana Nair Published May 23, 2024 Updated May 23, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn On Feb 26, American finance influencer Codie Sanchez posted a tweet discouraging “adults” from asking their friends for a ride to an airport. “Use Uber, save a friendship,” she advised in the viral post that generated over 25 million views, 2,500 likes and thousands of responses — both in agreement and disagreement. In the posts and comments agreeing with Ms Sanchez, I was struck to see that so many of us believe we should refrain from extending the simplest, most everyday gestures of kindness to our own friends. It had me wondering: When did doing favours for each other stop being a social norm? THE WEIGHT OF EXPECTATIONS In a previous workplace, a colleague helped me purchase a sandwich from 7-Eleven one morning. In return, I stopped by our usual coffee haunt after lunch and bought her an iced drink. When she asked how much she owed me, I waved it off. After all, it was only S$0.99. The smallest of favours. But she insisted and, the next thing I knew, I had S$0.99 more in my PayLah! wallet. A few months later, when someone offered to buy me my favourite teh C, I found myself desperate to repay them the S$2 it cost. This is something they wanted to do for me; I was under no obligation to feel indebted. Even then, I still transferred the S$2. “You can treat me another day,” I laughed in an attempt to hide my inexplicable discomfort. I was used to saying “I’ll get you the next round” to friends and family. The practice of writing off a debt immediately was unfamiliar to me — or even the idea of it being considered a “debt” at all. Why had I suddenly felt this strange pressure to immediately repay this particular gesture? I later found an explanation in political scientist Robert Axelrod’s \"tit for tat” game theory: We tend to reciprocate and mirror an action done towards us, whether positive or negative. That was the impact the S$0.99 transfer had on me: I suddenly felt like any “nice gesture” from others was an imposition by me on them, one that demanded compensation. I’LL (NOT) BE THERE FOR YOU We’ve all been there before, where asking a favour from a friend felt like we owed half our lives to them. Many times, I’ve instinctively said “I owe you one!”, instead of “thank you”. But it turns out that in general, people want their loved ones to “bother” them, showed a 2022 study published by the American Psychological Association — even though those reaching out may feel the gesture is insignificant. Clearly, it’s important to us to give freely to those around us. Unsplash It's important to us to give freely to those around us. The problem is that the capitalist nature of our lives encourages us to view our very selves as a collection of practical resources to be carefully expended. Take time, for instance. How often have we heard that we should be “maximising” our time? So many self-help resources online are about optimising the “5-9” (our time away from work) as best as possible for “productive” endeavours, such as creating a healthy routine. Anything outside this realm — helping a friend run an errand, for example — might detract from or deter our journey towards personal growth or achievement. On top of that, with so much automation and convenience around us, we have the perfect excuse to avoid helping our friends in ways that used to be commonplace, and instead suggest services that would do the same at a monetary cost. CONFRONTING MAIN CHARACTER SYNDROME With mental health awareness now at the forefront in many aspects of life, we’ve all heard the rhetoric that our personal needs should come first. But have we warped this idea a little too far beyond the original intent of self-care? To be clear, we all need boundaries. Some of these include not being available to our friends after a certain hour, or limiting the emotional support we can provide regarding burdensome or triggering topics. However, we seem to have forgotten that boundaries are meant to protect us from unhealthy situations, not prevent us from investing in healthy bonds with others. We need to be careful that our boundaries do not block us from connecting with those we care about — that “self-care” doesn’t become self-centredness. In The Art of Loving, German social psychologist Eric Fromm stated: “Love of others and love of ourselves are not alternatives”. Helping others does not have to come at the cost of our own mental well-being. In fact, when we extend kindness and favours towards others, it can actually alleviate our own symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improve our overall mental health, reported a study published in 2023 by the American Psychiatric Association. REVIVING SINGAPORE’S KAMPUNG SPIRIT Speaking as a Gen Z-er, as much as baby boomers may not understand us on many different principles, there was one thing they got right: Creating communities. The “kampung spirit” of older Singaporeans fostered togetherness and support, which has stood the test of time until today. While many of today’s youth readily avoid orientations or water cooler conversations , boomers are less likely to shy away from gathering together, as understood from countless stories of flourishing community involvement programmes for the elderly. Baby boomers are also more likely to help those around them, knowing that that gesture might not ever get repaid. A 2017 National University of Singapore study showed that the older Singaporeans are, the more inclined they are to volunteer, with senior citizens particularly generous with those who are socially distant. Growing up with my grandmother, I watched her befriend so many of our neighbours and regularly checked in on their and their family’s well-being. Many of these neighbours, I never knew personally — but they would look out for me in the community because of my grandmother. Have we let Singapore’s kampung spirit become a relic of the past? The answer is not yet set in stone — but as we continue to see rising levels of isolation and loneliness, it’s clear that we need to find new ways to support each other, beginning with our friendships. If we want to lay down a foundation of authenticity and trust in our social bonds, we need to be willing to extend kindness to others without requiring or expecting any reciprocation other than gratitude — and also to accept them in kind. Doing favours for our friends isn’t just about putting in effort or going the extra mile — it’s about creating opportunities for pure human connection. Perhaps kickstarting this cultural reset can be as simple as offering a friend a ride to the airport.

By Sufiyan Samsuri By Sufiyan Samsuri Published May 28, 2024 Updated May 28, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Whenever the subject of cars comes up in conversations with friends, the same thought always comes to my mind: Is it really necessary to be able to drive in Singapore? Singapore is well-known to have an efficient and world-class public transportation system. Having spent my entire life relying on trains and buses to get around, I’ve always wondered why so many people complain about how expensive it is to own a car here, but yet still choose to spend thousands of dollars to earn a driving licence when they may never own a car. Given how costly it is to undergo driving lessons and tests and how relatively affordable our public transport system is, obtaining a driving licence had never really been something I seriously considered. However, recent events have prompted me to have a change of heart — even if I don’t plan to own a car. NAVIGATING ‘ULU’ PLACES Believe it or not, even on a tiny island like Singapore, some places remain relatively inaccessible for public transport users. I vividly recall an instance where I had to attend a social gathering event after work at a certain government building at Mount Pleasant. At first glance, the usually reliable Google Maps told me that it was only less than 10 minutes’ walk from the nearest bus stop. To my horror, the walk led me through an unforgiving uphill slog. It seemed never-ending, especially after spending more than eight hours in the office hunched over a desk. Just a few minutes into this trek, my laptop that I carried in my bag started to feel like it was made of solid rock. By the time I arrived at my destination, I was drenched in sweat. My thighs were aching for days after. Mount “Pleasant”? As if. Hilly mini-route marches aside, even a leisurely visit to some of my favourite downtime destinations these days is still not easy or convenient. East Coast Park is one example, as there are no straightforward ways of getting there using public transport, especially on weekdays. Sure, you can always get anywhere by hopping into a cab or pulling up a ride-hailing app on your phone. But it’s likely fair to say we all have our own nightmare experiences with surge pricing and difficult drivers who refuse to go the extra mile when asked nicely, or even cancel booked rides for no rhyme or reason. WHY BUY WHEN YOU CAN SHARE? Cars bearing car-sharing brand logos are becoming more common a sight on our roads as well as in my own neighbourhood. Even though I can’t use car-sharing, their prevalence has led me to do my own research into why more Singaporeans are turning to them. Flexibility is one key pull factor for me — being able to use the services just for a short trip to a friend’s house at another ulu place or a full day spent running various errands. Affordability is another. Since I would not be a regular road user, the overall cost of renting a car, as opposed to owning one, would be more in my favour. I wouldn’t need to bear costs for maintenance, insurance, taxes and so on. Finally, there’s convenience. Most car-sharing services are accessible through mobile apps — a plus for me, as I already rely upon smartphone apps for most of my daily routine tasks, from setting my alarm, paying for meals and other purchases, to even grocery shopping. Lim Li Ting/TODAY A GetGo car-sharing vehicle parked in a housing estate. ROAD-TRIPPING Much like any young Singaporean, I love travelling once in a while to get away from the bustling cityscape. I’ve been fortunate enough to witness the breathtaking landscapes of Iceland and Arizona in the United States, among other memorable trips. One thing I’ve never been able to do is a road trip, driving for days on open roads through beautiful natural landscapes with incredible sceneries round every corner. A destination high up on my road-tripping bucket list would be New Zealand. For me, it's just second to Iceland, which I had been to on an organised tour group that did not feel as satisfying as I'd anticipated. I’ll admit: Listening to road trip stories of friends and watching travel videos on social media, the Fomo is starting to set in. Perhaps some places are much better off explored on the road by driving, instead of in a tour bus filled with 20 others. CARPOOL SITUATION When getting around different places in groups with family and friends, carpooling has been my go-to option most of the time. However, during Hari Raya visitations this year, I noticed the exhaustion setting in on the faces of the full-day drivers tasked with commuting the same group of people from one house to another — a total of seven destinations over at least five hours. Watching them fight off yawn after yawn, I felt a pang of guilt. I wondered: “Would it be better if I gave them a break and took over the wheel for a bit?” While it’s true that situations like these do not occur too often, as I get older, I’m starting to think that it would be nice if I could, once in a while, offer some help with ferrying my relatives around for family events. THINKING FORWARD Having tied the knot not too long ago, images of a possible future with kids in it have started flashing in my head. How would I get a toddler to daycare, and pick him up at the end of the day? Would I want to have my (potentially rowdy) kids running around on a crowded train or bus? If my family were indeed to get bigger, other necessities will also come into play — larger grocery loads, additional furniture, and more. Perhaps in this possible future, the increased practicality and convenience of private modes of transport would be well worth the additional monetary costs. All this considered, it might just be time to step out of my comfort zone at last, and into the driver’s seat. Here's hoping the numerous driving lessons that will be occupying my schedule for the next few months will be a good investment of my time and, more importantly, my money.

By Raymond Lim By Raymond Lim Published May 30, 2024 Updated May 30, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn While I was growing up, my father spent most of his time either working or unwinding at the void deck with his friends. Of all my childhood memories, the ones I hold closest to my heart are the times spent with my dad and elder brother after our Sunday swimming lessons where we would share snacks and laugh together. These moments were good, but they never lasted long. I always yearned to be able to spend more time with him. When my wife Diane and I had our first child, we decided that we never wanted our children to feel that sort of yearning. And so, even though we knew it would be a lot of work, we chose the path of homeschooling. Raymond Lim In an old photo from approximately 1990-1991, the teenaged writer poses with his father. Don’t get us wrong: Normal schools and textbooks are great. There’s nothing wrong with a conventional academic path; we just wanted something different for our kids. There are important real-life skills that kids can learn and develop outside of the traditional classrooms. The way we see it, education is not just about knowledge. It's about enabling our son, aged eight, and our daughter, aged four, to develop practical skills and sensibilities that they can carry with them throughout their lives. HOW IT WORKS In our family, I work full-time while my wife focuses on our kids' education. We follow a tailored curriculum that’s approved by the Ministry Of Education suited to each child's learning needs and pace. Outside of work, I join my kids for playtime and as many of their non-academic learning activities as I can, such as nature exploration, communications and speaking skills, as well as sports. We allocate budget, time and energy to ensure that each aspect of family life receives attention and resources. We plan and decide together which parent will take care of specific needs and oversee learning outcomes across different areas. Keeping our kids engaged in a wide range of activities outside the home allows them to develop their social skills through continuous interaction with other children and adults, regardless of age, location and background. With other homeschooling families, we share experiences and participate in activities such as swimming classes, art classes, sports development, science experiences and events, and communication and speaking skills. The children also have academic sessions with other homeschooled kids close to them in age. We often go camping and explore outdoor places like the Botanic Gardens, Zoo, Night Safari, and Gardens by the Bay. These outings allow us to learn about flora and fauna, as well as animal life such as insects and otters. We also participate in various cultural activities throughout the year, such as Hari Raya celebrations, Deepavali festivities where we learn to make prata, Lantern Festivals with dragon boat races, and Eurasian cultural gatherings. These don’t just provide opportunities for cultural appreciation; they also help us make diverse connections with others in our community. We also incorporate something called “world-schooling”: We take our kids with us when we travel for work, so they can learn from different places, peoples, and cultures. Taking them out of their comfort zones presents them with opportunities to grow and learn in their own way. Raymond Lim The author and his family in Phuket, Thailand in March 2022. He and his wife take the children abroad to give them opportunities to step outside of their comfort zones to learn from different places, peoples, and cultures. CONSTANT CHALLENGES Planning and organisation are tightropes we must always balance upon as we strive to maintain routines for our kids and family. We've found that our kids thrive on routines while also benefiting from creativity and real-life experiences. We have an inside joke that on any given week, my wife and kids are busier than me because of their studies, learning excursions, and other activities. My son, for example, has been enjoying soccer in our local community with Active SG (Sports) Soccer for the past three to four years and is now part of the local youth league. He is also involved in canoe polo at Passion Waves programmes. Outside of academics and extracurriculars, children face a lot of challenges today that we as parents and caregivers may not be aware of, such as bullying and peer pressure. As a coach and speaker, I strive to empower and support my kids by utilising some of my coaching and training techniques to boost their confidence and foster self-esteem building. More than knowing the right answers to science and maths questions, it’s important to me that my kids learn how to make the right choices when they encounter difficult personal and social situations as well. As the children progress to more advanced levels of schooling, the workload also becomes greater and more complex for the educator parent. Being part of a support group with past references to proper teaching content and guidance (both at the parents' and kids' level) will be beneficial for us to tackle any challenges or needs on the ground. It truly takes a village to raise a child, and this community, where we can give and share with other like-minded parents and caregivers, is an invaluable resource for us as we strive towards our learning goals. Raymond Lim The author's kids on a nature walk with other children in 2023, organised by a forest school in Singapore. Our aim now is to complete Primary School Leaving Examination learning for both our kids under homeschooling. Planning for secondary school and beyond will require us to reassess when our eldest completes the equivalent of Primary 4. IS HOMESCHOOLING FOR ME AND MY KIDS? Of course, homeschooling isn’t for every family. For starters, it requires plenty of time and dedication from one parent as an educator. This parent, who must be a degree holder, must be willing and able to put their career on extended hold. As such, another major point of deliberation and discussion is whether the family can support themselves financially, whether on a single full-time income stream or with one or both parents on a much more flexible work schedule. For parents who are considering homeschooling, it’s also important to keep in mind that taking on the role of educator for one’s kids is not simply about following a curriculum. It’s a full-time investment in your child’s academic and personal development — you become parent, teacher, principal, administrator, disciplinarian, co-curricular activities supervisor, counsellor and more, all at the same time. This can be overwhelming at times, and you may not always be able to take a break when you need it. For us, we’ve found that it’s a trade-off worth making for the chance to spend more time with our children, which was our original intention. I’m proud of the relationship I have with my son, where we can talk openly about anything and everything — so different from the one I had with my own father. At the end of the day, homeschooling is an unconventional journey with unique challenges, but if my wife and I had a choice, we’d definitely choose it all over again.

A breast cancer diagnosis was but another curveball the author has experienced. She describes why she kept it hush-hush for months but found herself feeling like an imposter at work. By Ryp Yong By Ryp Yong Published June 4, 2024 Updated June 5, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn In my middle age, I find myself continually slapped with life’s unpopular labels: Divorcee, job-hopper and, about eight months ago — cancer patient. Last October, I spent my 49th birthday having a radioactive drug called a tracer injected into a vein in my arm, which induced a cold sensation moving up my arm. I had to wait 60 minutes for the tracer to be absorbed by my body. Next, I had to lie on a narrow table that slid into a scanner that looked like a giant doughnut hole. I was told to hold very still for the next 40 minutes, during which the machine made deafening buzzing, clicking and clanging noises. At the end of the nauseating ordeal, the scans threw up bright spots on my right breast. The verdict was in: I have cancer. It was also Breast Cancer Awareness month. MID-LIFE ADVENTURES NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED The next couple of weeks were a blur of tears, confusion, and shock. But as a seasoned individual with high-functioning anxiety, I made medical decisions for myself swiftly, and lunged at the procedures the doctors had laid out for me. These included a two-hour lumpectomy, five days of radiotherapy treatments, and long-term use of Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator medication I must continue taking for the next five years. This was a harrowing experience even for a mid-lifer who has been served many of life’s health curveballs including uterine fibroids, insomnia and, currently, perimenopause. But life goes on. I’m only halfway to the end, if the 100-year-life is indeed a thing. I started 2024 as a caregiver to myself and resigning from a promising career at the Agency for Integrated Care, one I had worked hard to kickstart. It was particularly meaningful to me because I liked engaging with seniors, I could apply my newly minted Masters of Applied Gerontology from the Singapore University of Social Sciences, and importantly, I was finally at a level (assistant director) which was closest to what I’d previously earned in the corporate world. I ushered in Chinese New Year with muted enthusiasm, largely from the bad news of cancer, but in part because I had to abstain from my all-time favourite, bak kwa. Post-cancer, the oncologists’ orders were that I had to exercise more, eat less fatty food, and think happy thoughts. Anatomically, I was no different from before. Physically, I tired more easily. Emotionally, I was a mess. Over the next few months, I went through rehabilitation and counselling services at the Singapore Cancer Society. Twice a week, I attended “Strength Training ABC” (After Breast Cancer) sessions, as well as diet and nutritional consultations. The multi-disciplinary care team at the Singapore Cancer Society — receptionists, exercise trainers, social workers, counsellors, dieticians and doctors —provided excellent integrated and holistic care for me, helping me rebuild my body, mind, and soul with buoying cheer. Eventually, I got mentally and emotionally stronger. I decided to look for a job and found Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL). Having spent 23 years of my career as a corporate storyteller, I am still finding my footing and niche in the social services sector. Since crossing over in 2020, thanks to the open-minded hiring managers that I encountered in Rainbow Centre, Tsao Foundation and CAL, I have had the opportunity to work with persons living with autism and multiple disabilities, seniors, and, presently, caregivers to loved ones with mental health issues and dementia. FEELING LIKE A FAKE AT WORK I feel like an imposter in my current place of work because they are unaware — or at least I’ve not told them — about the Big C. But neither did I conceal the truth. I indicated “divorced” in the employment application form, and during the pre-employment check-up, I informed the doctor that I had recently undergone surgery, radiotherapy treatment and am on breast cancer medication. My therapist at Singapore Cancer Society questioned my need to withhold this information at work. We dedicated several sessions analysing my conundrum. In the end, the truth emerged: I wanted to be judged for my competence at work, and not my cancer. While I was comfortable being vulnerable with friends, family and colleagues, I wasn’t open to pity from everyone. I was reluctant to have my doting aunts — all in their 70s — worry about me when they have health and ageing issues of their own. I didn’t want to be a burden to others. And so, I was able to share the news only with my inner circle. (Many will read this commentary and be shocked.) Even though I have my reasons for keeping my health status under wraps, I feel like an imposter at work because many of my colleagues in CAL are caregivers or persons in recovery. At least three colleagues are caregivers to siblings with schizophrenia. At least another three are caregivers to parents with dementia or depression. A handful other colleagues are recovering from anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. Some have even openly shared their experiences of past suicide attempts. Worse, in my role in communications, I encourage caregivers who have benefitted from CAL’s caregivers-to-caregivers training programme to step out, tell their stories, and advocate for mental health and caregiving, to reduce the stigma around mental health. Perhaps the biggest guilt trip came in early May, when we launched CAL 4 Mental Wellness, an annual campaign to promote mental health awareness and caregiving and fundraise to support and empower mental health caregivers. In this campaign, we call these caregivers “Hidden Heroes”. The irony is not lost on me. HIDING NO MORE A couple of weeks ago, I received an invitation to attend an event commemorating the inaugural Cancer Survivors’ Day by the Singapore Cancer Society. The event took place on June 1. President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, patron of the society, was the guest of honour. Counselling and CAL have both helped to build up my confidence and to realise, after this much-needed adjustment period, that my cancer diagnosis does not define me. With these things falling into place, this invitation seemed to pull the trigger on the starting gun for me. I’ve decided that I am now ready, eight months on, to step into my light and live my truth. Cancer may have taken a small lump from my breast, but it has given me renewed perspective and purpose. I live my life in fast-forward now, focusing on meaningful pursuits that make me happy. Strange as it may seem, cancer has become not a death sentence for me, but a new lease on life.

By Alvona Loh Zi Hui By Alvona Loh Zi Hui Published June 6, 2024 Updated June 6, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn As an avid lover of aerial exercises, I enjoy practising gravity-defying sequences and tricks that involve suspending myself in the air on various apparatus such as pole, hammock and chair. After each practice, I usually post my fitness videos on Instagram. Of all the apparatus I have tried, my pole videos often stand out in terms of the responses they elicit from viewers both in Singapore and abroad. “You are just showing too much skin!” some viewers would often remark. Many also believe that pole dance is an indecent or lewd activity, close or if not equivalent to stripping. This continues to be a common misconception, as most people associate pole dancing with sleazy situations and settings as seen in TV and movies or in real life performed in places such as night clubs or bars. Alvona Loh Zi Hui Author Alvona Loh attempting a pole exercise. FROM HESITANCY TO UNDERSTANDING Before I enrolled in pole dancing classes, my own mother frowned upon the idea of immersing myself in a dance genre that is overly sexualised and possibly provocative, one usually practised or performed while skimpily clad. Despite my interest in trying out pole, I myself was somewhat hesitant to do it regularly. It was a strange, unfamiliar feeling for me to be wearing so much less than usual. I was also troubled by what others would think: What if people thought I was promiscuous or morally loose based on what I wear while doing pole? Or just for doing pole at all? However, I quickly saw that most pole dancers keep their skin as bare as they do in order to grip the pole safely, especially during climbs and inversions. If one wears long-sleeved tops or long bottoms such as pants or leggings, it can be rather slippery on the pole, leading to poor grip and consequent slips and falls. This is extremely dangerous, and can even result in severe head injuries if one happens to fall from an upside-down position. On top of that, I learnt that moisturisers and barrier creams on the skin are also a big no-no before pole practice. One really has to leave the skin “bare” in the most literal sense, with absolutely nothing on it. As I explored pole dancing more, I began to understand that it’s not at all equivalent to stripping. It also dawned on me that not all pole dances are equal. There is a plethora of styles and genres available to choose from. These include lyrical pole where sequences are usually done with bare feet, appear contemporary and accompanied with soothing music, as well as exotic pole, where dancers often wear high heels and incorporate floor work and shoulder stands on the ground. On the other hand, if one prefers to focus on pole fitness rather than dance elements like myself, one can simply aim to attain a particular shape on the pole and forgo all the rhythmic or musical elements of dance. Pole really is a whole world, one that most people know so little about because of preconceived notions. WHAT IS ‘APPROPRIATE’? The first few reactions to my pole videos came from friends, who asked if I would be attracting the “wrong” kind of attention. Yet, venturing into the world of pole practice made me feel young, healthy and happy. Wouldn’t it be a waste if I chose to limit myself due to others’ biases? I soon realised that what is appropriate can differ based on perspective. Is it “appropriate” to dress modestly but dangerously for a pole sequence full of inversions and leg hangs? Or is it “appropriate” to attend barefoot an exotic pole class that stipulates heels as a requirement? After all, what is truly appropriate in the practice of any activity should not be determined by third-party spectators, but by what the practitioner feels suits him or her, that helps in the effective execution of said activity safely and comfortably. The pole community is a supportive one, both online and in real life, and many pole influencers often post reels to illustrate why they need to dress a certain way to maintain their grip on the pole. Some even post funny reactions to viewers’ comments that ask or even lecture them to dress appropriately, for example, by performing pole routines while deliberately wearing loud mascots outfits of cartoons and animals to retaliate against strangers’ attempts to shame them or control what they wear. Over time, I felt less and less of a need to constantly explain myself and what I wear in my pole videos, or to pull back on my involvement in this particular activity just because others did not understand the nature of it and the dressing needs associated with it. HOLDING OUR GROUND People can be quick to judge and form their own conclusions about an unconventional activity or sport, even if they have little or imperfect information about it. We cannot control how other might think. However, we can educate and inform. Pole influencers such as Claire Bear Polerina do this by creating reels to demonstrate how she slips from a pole when wearing long-sleeved clothing, as compared to being able to maintain good grip with bare skin on a pole. However, regardless of efforts to inform others, we have to accept that their viewpoints are ultimately up to them. It’s up to each of us to hold our ground even when we face disapproval or negative judgement from others. The lens of our personal perspectives can become clouded by stigma and misconceptions, and that’s part and parcel of life. But our choices belong to us alone, and we have the freedom and agency to choose what is safe and suitable for ourselves. Now, after seeing how much confidence, physical strength and flexibility I’ve gained through pole, my mother enjoys watching my Instagram reels. She even enjoys watching pole reels almost as much as I do now. To me, she is proof that, with time and information, anyone can alter their staunch viewpoints and long-held stigma. Even so, I know it’s not possible for me to be able to get approval from everyone on everything I want to do, both in the pole studio and outside of it. All the same, I hope that we as a society strive less to criticise others and more to acknowledge that everyone has the right to decide what to do with their own body, even though we may not understand or agree personally.

By Antoine Blanc By Antoine Blanc Published June 11, 2024 Updated June 11, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn A few weeks ago, my son had an unfortunate accident, and we found ourselves spending the night at the hospital where there were no books. You can imagine how children might feel a sense of anxiety, not being in their own bed. To soothe his anxiety from the injury and discomfort of not being in his own bed, I pulled up an artificial intelligence (AI) app on my phone. Within minutes, a complete story was generated featuring him as the main character, soundtracked by soft music in the background, and tailored around his favorite theme — dinosaurs. This turned out to be our best bedtime story in ages. It wasn't just because of AI. It was the giggles we shared debating who the villain in the tale would be. (Spoiler alert: It wasn't him.) He didn't watch the screen; he just listened to me reading the AI story and the music playing. For centuries, bedtime stories have served as a universal language of love and connection between parents and children. Bedtime stories spark imaginations, soothe anxieties, and create unique memories. Think about it: I’m sure you can name your favorite book from when you were a child. Pexels Bedtime stories spark imaginations, soothe anxieties, and create unique memories. While modern discussions about AI often revolve around efficiency, power, and intelligence, this recent experience with my son has prompted me to consider how AI can provide peace and warmth in unexpected moments. THE ORIGINS OF BEDTIME STORIES The origins of bedtime stories can be traced back to the early days of human civilisation. In ancient Greece, people would tell stories of gods and heroes at night. In ancient India, people would recite the Vedas and other sacred texts at night as a way of transmitting religious knowledge and wisdom. As civilisations developed, these oral traditions evolved into written forms, which were further democratised by the invention of mass print. The first time the term “bedtime stories” publicly appears is in Bed-Time Stories by American poet Louise Chandler Moulton, published in 1873. AI-generated stories won’t replace traditional bedtime stories anytime soon Today, many cultures around the world still leverage bedtime stories to share creation myths and natural phenomenon explanations. These stories, passed down through generations, connect children to their ancestors' worldview and foster a sense of belonging. They're a cornerstone of cultural identity, shaping how little ones understand the(ir) universe. AI-generated stories can be new and exciting, which make them a valuable addition to intimate exchanges once in a while. But they lack that inherent cultural touch, which means they likely won't replace traditional tales passed down in families through generations. NOT ONE OR THE OTHER, BUT BOTH Instead, the bedtime story is one example of how the AI-driven future might be a blend of both personal sentiment and technological progress, where the latter elevates the former. Here’s how: More personalisation: Hearing a story with your own name creates a sense of excitement, keeping the child engaged while still drawing on the comfort of familiar elements. Greater interactivity: AI-powered stories will become more interactive, allowing children to make choices that influence the narrative, bringing a special “wow” moment. Deeper immersion: AI-generated music can transform a personalised story. Think of audiobooks on steroids; changing ambient music with each new story generated. One other area where AI has the potential to strengthen parent-child bonds is in its ability to augment learning experiences. On May 13, OpenAI unveiled its new version of ChatGPT, which can deliver personalised learning experiences by asking interactive questions and ensuring understanding at each stage of a math problem. Watching the video demonstration, what struck me wasn’t the learning feature, but the bonding between a father and son as they interacted and discussed to find solutions, supported by a voice-activated ChatGPT to nudge them in the right direction. OpenAI/YouTube On May 13, OpenAI unveiled its new version of ChatGPT, which can deliver personalised learning experiences by asking interactive questions and ensuring understanding at each stage of a math problem. AI FOR STRONGER PARENT-CHILD BONDS AI can never replace the comfort of a mother's voice or that worn copy of Goodnight Moon. But in those unexpected moments, like a hospital stay without a children's book, having an AI app on your phone can be a saving grace. That night, what my son was asking for wasn't really a story, but comfort in the form of a new adventure to share with his dad — one where he would be the hero and a T. rex would be his best friend. I've designed a free web app, webstories.ai, just for that: Creating a story in children’s favorite themes. In moments like this, the ability to create a personalised adventure that resonates with your child's imagination can be a lot of fun. Over time, AI will gradually play a bigger role in our lives. If we can embrace this blend of tradition and innovation, I believe the bond between parent and child will blossom in new ways with AI, fostering shared learning and bonding, and other enriching experiences.

By Kelvin Seah Lee Nguon By Kelvin Seah Lee Nguon Published June 13, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Three years ago, I wrote a commentary about my journey as a stay-at-home dad, including both the drudgery and the delight of watching up close my sons’ growth and development. Who knew that commentary would trigger a series of events with far greater ripple effects than I could have ever imagined? Back then in June 2021, Dr Tam Wai Jia wrote a follow-up piece to mine the very next week. In it, she championed the roles of stay-at-home dads like her husband and me, and our life-altering decision to be main caregivers to our kids. I didn’t know her at the time, but we later connected over social media. I soon got to know her husband as well, whom I started meeting up with every month to talk candidly about the ups and downs of our journeys as stay-at-home dads. After commiserating together for nearly two years, we had our very first expanded meeting in March 2023 where four more stay-at-home dads showed up to chat with us about their parenting experience. This fledgling community has now grown to over 45 members, and was even briefly featured in a CNA documentary in February this year. To grow from six to over 45 members in 15 months is no mean feat for an organic, ground-up movement that started with just two fathers. ORDINARY DADS When this community of stay-at-home dads first met, one of the first things I noticed was how we were all so different. Most were in their 30s and 40s, but we also had a few dads in their 50s (like me) and one over 60. Some were still working part-time or running their own business full-time from home, while others were taking a break from the rat race, with plans to return to full-time work soon. Despite these differences, it was clear each of us shared one thing in common: We prioritised family above everything else, and were focused on raising our kids the best way we could. It was also clear just how “ordinary” we were — which is why we call ourselves The Ordinary Dad. Ili Mansor/TODAY The author (in dark green) in a meeting of The Ordinary Dad on June 11, 2023. In The Ordinary Dad, conversations often revolve around all things domestic and parenting: From best practices for potty training, to school and homework routines, to meals we prepare or home appliances we repair. We even talk about the best ways to control pest infestation, while simultaneously gushing over someone’s home aquarium or ant farm. But, men being men, we also talk a lot about sports and games, politics, current affairs, and business. We uplift and spur one another on in our parenting journeys, in ways I have never experienced with other guys my age. One dad told me about a memorable incident with his four-year-old, at his extended family celebration of Mother's Day last month. The boy, who usually pouts at large gatherings, suddenly greeted his mum with a jolly “Happy Mother's Day!” at the top of his lungs. This made everyone smile and his mother's heart melt, even after the little boy started wishing everyone in the room the same, including people who weren’t even mothers. In the days since, when the child misbehaves, this father now recalls that Mother's Day incident and is able to exchange annoyance for delight instead. Another dad shared that one evening, as he was coaxing his three-year-old son to sleep, an impromptu conversation ensued, and soon he found himself chit-chatting with his son like never before. In that moment, it was as if his kid had transformed instantly from a toddler to a young man. This father found himself enjoying the moment so much, he forgot the frustrating day he’d just had as a stay-at-home dad. He shared with our community that he looked forward to more such conversations in the years ahead. WHY OUR COMMUNITY EXISTS What makes our little community work? Firstly, we recognise our vulnerabilities as men who have stepped away from what’s still widely deemed to be a conventional fathering role — being the main breadwinner. Much of society views and treats us differently because of our counter-cultural choice to be stay-at-home fathers. If we were to suppress the vulnerabilities we have in this role, or even internalise for ourselves such societal prejudices, we run a greater emotional and relational risk to ourselves and our families. And so, instead of soldiering on by ourselves in isolation, we openly share our need for help with one another in our community. We talk openly about our parenting struggles and how our children push us to the limits of our patience and tolerance. To this end, having a safe, non-judgmental space in which stay-at-home dads can commiserate helps in no small way. Ili Mansor/TODAY Being in The Ordinary Dad has taught the author how important it is for stay-home dads such as himself to be able to talk openly about parenting struggles. Secondly, we are all journeying through the daily realities of being stay-at-home dads — and, to us, that journey is of equal if not greater value than the “destination” of raising kids well. While we do sometimes offer up practical solutions for each other’s issues, that’s not the raison d'etre for our community. For us, what often makes for a greater impact is simply being able to open up to other dads who can resonate with and value the experiences and empathies shared. In doing so, we are able to draw strength and comfort to get us through the most trying of days. CONNECTING, SHARING, ENCOURAGING Though The Ordinary Dad meets once a month in person to chat and connect, our conversations don’t end there. Between these monthly meetings, we continue to communicate online as well as in smaller, breakout groups that meet voluntarily face-to-face, either because of shared interests and hobbies, or proximity in terms of where we live, or our kids’ ages — or just because we happen to click with each other. These small-group exchanges happen organically, with no expectations, fixed routines or schedules. Our only desire is to connect, encourage each other, and share our lives. Over the past 15 months, we have become important pillars and sources of comfort and hope for one another in this hectic world, especially when the parenting journey gets tough and we feel like we’re on the edge of losing our sanity. All in all, this group has been a masterclass for me, teaching me the importance of not walking difficult paths alone and the power of community to transform each of our lives for the better. To all my fellow fathers out there, whether you’re a working dad or a stay-at-home one, here’s wishing you a Happy Father’s Day!

By Chua Ee Chien By Chua Ee Chien Published June 18, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Up until January of this year, I was the co-owner of two restaurant bars. I say “was” because both establishments have closed down, within a few months of each other. The rate of business closures in Singapore has been ramping up in recent years, from 50,423 closures in 2022 to 51,763 in 2023, data shows from the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority. Most recently, there has been a bit of a hoo-ha around the closure of Thambi Magazine Store, an iconic newsstand along Lorong Liput in Holland Village. From the day the news was announced right up till the store’s closure on May 5, many took to the Internet to lament the loss of a pillar of Singapore’s retail landscape and history. Op-eds and articles were published, and social media platforms flowed over with netizens reminiscing about their experiences buying magazines and books at Thambi when they were younger. I myself have fond memories of buying Archie Comics from that very store. But when was the last time any of us actually handed over cash for a magazine there? IT’S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, MONEY, MONEY In the aftermath of my own business closures, for my partners and I, the question that kept popping up in conversations with others was why we closed. It seemed to me that the answer was obvious: We were losing a substantial amount of money each month. It’s a well-known fact that times are tough and are only getting tougher, amid rising costs, reduced spending power and manpower constraints. Of course, there are always a few possible reasons why a business might be closing. The owner could be retiring, for example. Or perhaps the lease for the venue where the business operates is up for renewal, and the owner wants to do something different. But one underlying theme generally covers the majority of closures: There’s just not enough revenue. Witnessing the closure of a cherished spot can bring a profound sense of loss. It's more than just a venue; it’s the backdrop to our community and connections. Chua Ee Chien A cocktail class from October 2023, held at one of the author's recently closed establishments. We read about a historic restaurant bowing out and say: “So sad, we had our first date here.” We hear the news about a neighbourhood beauty store shuttering and think: “What a pity; I bought my first lip gloss from there.” But when was the last time you got dinner from the hole-in-the-wall restaurant where you had your first date with your partner? Or picked up lipstick from the family-run beauty store by your house, instead of pulling up Shopee on autopilot? Waxing lyrical about times past can give us an emotional kick — but for those involved in such businesses, our memories don’t do much to make them money. Of course, the restaurant or shop has to provide some sort of continued value to you. There are always many new entrants in any market, and also those who continue to survive and prosper. Changes and closures are inevitable — it’s part of the business circle of life. Consumers’ needs and wants change over time, and businesses have to be adaptable enough to stick around. It's easy to think that one’s customers will always be there, but it’s a customer’s prerogative to continue patronising a shop or not. Businesses have to work for it. HARDER AND HARDER TO STAY AFLOAT On my own failed ventures, people often ask me if I would do it all over again if I could turn back time. My honest answer is “no”. No, I would not do it again. GoDaddy The author in a February 2022 photo at one of his bar-restauraunts. Running any business is demanding. Not just financially, but physically, mentally and emotionally as well. Having to close a business is another thing altogether. Making such a final decision involves a significant amount of stress for all involved, not to mention sadness and disappointment. Someone said to me just a couple weeks ago: “No problem lah. Start over again.” I understand that they might have been trying to encourage me, to help me look ahead instead of dwelling on pains of the past. However, it’s hard to ignore that trite comments such as these can often belittle the overwhelming amounts of time, money and energy local business owners pour into their ventures to keep them afloat. In this climate, we can afford to be more thoughtful and sensitive about our reactions and responses to the closure of any business, whether we know the people involved or not. There’s a famous quote from the Harry Potter series: “It is our choices that show us who we truly are, far more than our abilities.” In this day and age, change is happening faster than ever. Books and magazines have moved online; new fads about food and drink, clothing and more pop up on social media practically on a weekly basis. But one thing that won’t change anytime soon is that we each have the choice to support our local businesses — by giving them money in exchange for goods and services, rather than lamenting their imminent deaths on social media. Perhaps instead of waiting for nostalgia to bring out the best in us, it’s time to put our money where our mouths are.

Samuel Woo/TODAY New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Is surge pricing a reasonable practice to deter scalpers and manage high demand for sales for concerts and live shows in Singapore, or just a cash grab by entertainers and ticketing companies? Dynamic pricing may be a moving target, says this TODAY journalist, but it shouldn't be a shot in the dark for ticket buyers. By Loraine Lee By Loraine Lee Published May 17, 2024 Updated May 17, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn On May 12, TODAY published an article on increasingly heated ire among attendees of concerts and live performances in Singapore. Fans of Icelandic jazz-pop singer Laufey and popular musical Hamilton were up in arms — not about their favourite acts coming to town, but about the exorbitant prices they were facing on ticket purchase sites due to dynamic pricing . Reactions to the story — penned by yours truly — threw oil onto the fire surrounding the rise of dynamic pricing for such events in Singapore, reigniting the debate on whether such a pricing model is reasonable, or even acceptable. CASH GRAB In theory, dynamic pricing means prices will rise when there is high demand, and drop when there is little to no demand. But high demand is typical for such events in Singapore — Taylor Swift fans queued overnight for her tickets outside Singpost and Coldplay’s six shows sold out within hours . Major ticketing and promoter companies claim that dynamic pricing guards against scalping. However, many members of the public see the use of this model as these companies turning into \"scalpers\" themselves, forcing much higher prices onto ticket buyers than usual. Several also questioned if dynamic pricing was the best solution to deal with both high demand and scalpers. They asked: What about a lottery-style sale instead? In lottery-based sales in places such as Japan and Taiwan, tickets are tied to buyers' identity numbers or passport numbers. Some venues do not reveal seat numbers until a few days before the event, making it harder to resell tickets, pointed out netizens. With so much uncertainty around how dynamic pricing will hike up entertainment tickets, some also said they would not attend any event with such a volatile model. Some in this camp predicted that such a pricing model might eventually drive many others away from going to concerts, and warned of dire impacts on Singapore's burgeoning concert industry in the long run. Coldplay/X Some predict that the increasing use of dynamic pricing may drive more people away from live shows, negatively impacting Singapore's burgeoning concert industry in the long run. LUXURY GOOD On the other hand, another faction argued that the rage over dynamic pricing for entertainment events was ridiculous. Basically: If you can't afford it, just don't attend. \"Why (are) Singaporeans complaining? A concert is a luxury,\" said one Facebook user. \"Do not chase a lifestyle that (you can't afford).\" Another labelled the use of dynamic pricing for entertainment events a \"rich people problem\". Some called the backlash ironic. After all, they said, dynamic pricing is not new in Singapore. Demand-based pricing has long been commonly used to price services like air travel, food delivery and ride-hailing . A few also agreed with Ticketmaster and other ticketing companies that dynamic pricing is a reasonable way to deal with scalpers. With prices less predictable, scalpers have to take a higher risk when purchasing tickets to resell. Should a scalper purchase a ticket that is too expensive, they may struggle to resell the ticket and end up making a loss, especially if demand falls off sharply after some time. ON THE RIGHT TO HAVE FUN So why should most of us care about how tickets for entertainment events are priced, especially if they are a \"luxury\"? Considering this question, it's important to note that concerts and live performances were not necessarily luxurious goods up until quite recently. In 2003, the most expensive ticket for a joint concert by UK bands Travis and Coldplay in Singapore was S$101. Adjusted for inflation, that's about S$128.39 today. Conversely, Coldplay's most expensive ticket for their 2024 concert here was S$1,098. Of course several factors, including different venues and theatrics used, contribute to pushing prices up over the years. But with dynamic pricing in the mix, concerts might soon become real luxuries most of us won't be able to afford. Should this be the case though? Surely we all deserve to have some fun in our lives — something that helps us break free from the monotony of everyday humdrum. Life should not just be about meeting the basic needs of physical sustenance. Realistically, however, nothing is stopping entertainers, promoters and organisers from implementing dynamic pricing. Hence, the next best thing could be guidelines to ensure consumer rights are protected. One way to go about it? Price transparency. In the case of Laufey's show, other than being told prices were \"starting\" at S$98, fans essentially had to go into the ticket-purchasing process blind. In place of the typical colour-coded seat map with different price categories, this particular all-blue seating map said only that prices started from S$98 and were \"subject to change in accordance with demand\". Some Laufey fans ended up paying upwards of S$268 for a ticket to see the 25-year-old singer perform. livenationsg/Instagram Screengrab of a seating map published by Live Nation on Instagram of jazz-pop singer Laufey’s concert in Singapore taken on April 29, 2024. The image has since been taken down. While some were willing to spend that sum, many were still upset that there had been no way to know ticket prices in advance until they were well into the seat selection process last Monday and Tuesday during the ticket sales. One fan also told me that they had to skip the concert when they realised the final prices were out of their budget. To make dynamic pricing more equitable, event organisers should maintain the offering of differently priced categories, as well as implement a suitable price cap for each category so consumers can manage their own expectations of what they're willing to pay. Ticket buyers also deserve more clarity on exactly how dynamic pricing is calculated for each event. Additionally, entertainment organisers and promoters should be required to have safeguards in place to prevent bots from artificially inflating demand — or, better yet, not allow bots to access their website at all. Whatever happens, I hope it won't cost me a kidney to see Taylor Swift live the next time she drops by. And if it does, you might find me with one less kidney. Or, more realistically, in “Category 100” — on a picnic mat outside the National Stadium with my organs intact. ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Loraine Lee is a journalist at TODAY.

By the time the animal was taken to a vet by non-governmental organisation Save Our Street Dogs (SOSD), the paw was necrotising, that is the cells were dying, and the vet thought the paw would need to be amputated. On Friday (May 17), Khor was fined S$4,500 for unreasonably omitting to do an act which caused unnecessary pain and suffering to his dog. He was also barred from owning any pet for 12 months. Pleading for leniency, Khor told the court that he had not neglected his dog, and tried to help it by putting antiseptic on the wound. He also argued that the circumstances were different from other cases of neglect as his dog was on Pulau Ubin, a \"rural area... different from an urban (environment)\". However, the judge dismissed his claims and said that Khor should have known better by taking his dog to the vet when he noticed the wound was infested with maggots. WHAT HAPPENED Mr Lim Chong Hui, prosecutor for the National Parks Board (NParks), told the court that Khor, who lives most of the time on mainland Singapore, kept his dog and its nine puppies with his cousin, Ms Ho Beng Neo, who lived on Pulau Ubin. Sometime between July and August 2021, Khor visited the island and noticed a wound on his dog's paw. He cleaned the wound with an antiseptic and instructed his cousin to continue cleaning the dog's wound before he returned home. Mr Lim did not mention how the dog injured its paw, or why Khor had left his dog with Mr Ho on Pulau Ubin. When Khor visited the dog later — Mr Lim said this was \"probably one to two weeks later\" — Khor noticed that the wound had become bigger with maggots crawling in the wound. Instead of taking his pet to the vet, he cleaned the wound with an antiseptic and picked out the maggots. He then left the dog with his cousin and returned home. As the wound worsened, Ms Ho grew worried and asked friends and relatives for help. Khor's nephew then put Ms Ho in touch with volunteers from SOSD, who helped take the dog to a vet on mainland Singapore. By then, the dog's paw was necrotising and it had several open cavities with maggots. It also had “putrid brown discharge dripping” from the wound. While the vet expected to amputate the paw due to the severity of the wound, the dog was able to make a full recovery after it was warded for 10 days. SOSD reported the incident to the Animal and Veterinary Service, part of NParks, on Aug 26, 2021. RURAL AREA The prosecutor sought a fine of S$5,000, arguing that Khor was \"well aware that his treatment of (his dog's) wounds was simply not working\". \"Any ordinary observer would know when they see maggots in a wound that they need to bring a pet to the vet,\" said Mr Lim. He added it was \"fortuitous\" that the dog's paw did not need to be amputated because Khor's cousin had found a way to seek help. The prosecutor also said that NParks had initially offered him a composition fine of S$1,000 and gave him five reminders to pay the fine. Khor pleaded for leniency, adding that he loves his dog \"like his own child\". He also said in Mandarin that he did not want to move the dog as it had given birth recently when it was injured, and it was \"eager to look after the pups\". However, District Judge Lorraine Ho noted he had not visited the dog while it was warded at the vet. \"When a person is sick, they need medical treatment even if they stay on Pulau Ubin. It's the same for pets as well,\" she said. \"It is the responsibility of every pet owner to ensure the health of their pets, regardless of where the pet is located.\" For unreasonably omitting to do an act which caused unnecessary pain and suffering to his dog, Khor faced up to 18 months' jail, a fine of up to S$15,000, or both. The offence also comes with a disqualification from owning pets for a period of time.

In the video, Filipino-American Andre Carrillo, 28, who has more than 216,000 followers on TikTok, uses sarcasm to make various statements that are actually the opposite of how he feels about Singapore. He spells this out near the end of the video. The video that lasted slightly more than a minute was posted on Saturday (May 18) and it starts with Mr Carrillo saying that he would \"never go back to Singapore\". In the video — which had received more than 326,000 views and 13,600 likes as of Monday — Mr Carrillo says that Singapore is \"incredibly boring\", before showing clips of him at several tourist attractions such as Universal Studios Singapore, Chinatown and Marina Bay Sands. \"I hate how hawker centres are spread conveniently throughout the city making it that you never have to go too far for food,\" Mr Carrillo adds. This is while the video showcases contrasting clips of several hawker and restaurant meals he ate. Alongside clips of him kayaking in mangroves at Pulau Ubin, he says that everything in Singapore is \"man-made, (it is) literally the most artificial country I've stepped foot in\". As the video ends, Mr Carrillo says that he hopes viewers realise that he was being \"sarcastic\". \"This is why you'll never hear me say,\" Mr Carrillo said before the video repeats with him stating: \"I'll never come back to Singapore\". In the video description, Mr Carrillo wrote that he has visited Singapore five times and never gets bored with the country. \"Anytime I make a video about Singapore though, so many Singaporeans comment with things like 'I don’t see what’s so nice about Singapore and I live here',\" he continued \"The grass will always be greener on the other side, and for people like me who grew up in California, I can assure you there are tons of things I think Singapore does better than us; it might be the same feeling some Singaporeans get when visiting other places!\" Mr Carrillo's video has attracted more than 690 comments, with some missing the influencer's tongue-in-cheek humour, and apparently not getting as far as his reference to sarcasm. One commenter said that he agreed with Mr Carrillo's statements, taking them at face value: \"I'm always at (a loss) when my foreign friends ask me what to do in Singapore.\" To this, another online user pointed out Mr Carrillo was being sarcastic. Several others also made rude remarks about him, stating that he should keep quiet and not make rude comments about Singapore. Some also gave him suggestions on areas that he could visit during his next trip here. The majority of commenters, however, found Mr Carrillo's sarcasm to be humorous and they made their own jokes. \"I was about to attack,\" one said, seemingly ready to argue that Singapore is not a boring place. Another joked that Mr Carrillo nearly made the \"whole of Singapore\" angry towards him. One TikTok user commented that Mr Carrillo was welcome to visit Singapore and \"be sarcastic again\". Responding to queries from TODAY, Mr Carrillo said he thought his sarcasm would have been \"obvious\" since all the clips he used showed him having fun in Singapore. \"I also added so much information that I feel like someone who doesn't like Singapore wouldn't have included if they really didn't like (the country),\" he said, pointing to his comments about Singapore's cultural diversity as an example. Mr Carrillo did acknowledge he might have been \"a bit too sarcastic\" when he was talking about Singapore's local food scene. \"Perhaps I could have said something like 'there's no options' while showcasing the diverse food choices,\" he lamented. Nonetheless, Mr Carrillo added he is not upset that people misunderstood his humour. Rather, he is sad that some Singaporeans who did not watch his entire video might think he hates Singapore. \"I hope the algorithm brings them back to the many other videos I've already made about Singapore,\" he said. In a separate reply to a comment on his TikTok video, Mr Carrillo said he plans to visit Singapore again in July. Several social media videos about people's opinions on Singapore as a travel destination have gone viral in the past. In March, travel vlogger “ninas_travels” said that she would never visit Singapore again, annoying some Singaporeans. In this case, the vlogger meant what she wrote literally. Explaining her reasons in the video’s caption, the vlogger named Nina Gerhards said that Singapore is the \"most boring country (I have ever been to)”. The Instagram video has had more than 2.7 million views since it was published.

Raisi, along with Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and other high-ranking Iranian officials, were in a helicopter headed towards the Iranian city of Tabriz, where he was scheduled to inaugurate a project at an oil refinery. While en route, at about 1pm on Sunday (5.30pm Singapore time), the helicopter, a Bell 212 developed by the US in the 1960s, went down after a technical failure. Search and rescue teams were deployed to scour the area through heavy rain and fog. More than 10 hours later, the charred wreckage of the helicopter was found in a remote, mountainous area near the border with Azerbaijan. Iran's former foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has since said that the United States had a part to play in the crash, as sanctions imposed by the superpower prevented Iran from purchasing newer aircraft. Prof Shahram Akbarzadeh, a research professor from Deakin University specialising in Middle East Politics, also noted in responses to queries from TODAY that Iran's air fleet is very old due to the sanctions. The sanctions, imposed in 1979, also means Iran is unable to purchase spare parts to maintain its ageing fleet of planes and helicopters, resulting in frequent air accidents. WHAT'S NEXT FOR IRAN? Mr Mohammad Mokhber, the first Vice President of Iran, has been appointed acting President until the country heads to the polls on June 28 to elect a new President. But political experts told TODAY there is unlikely to be any major changes to Iran's domestic policy. \"This will be an administrative hiccup as the administration figures out their day-to-day functions with the president and foreign minister out of the picture,\" said Prof Akbarzadeh. \"It may be administrative chaos, but there will not be a strategic change in domestic and international policy.\" Prof Mehran Kamrava of Georgetown University in Qatar added that Iran's foreign policy will likely remain the same too. While the late foreign minister Amir-Adollahian was the architect of Iran's 'good neighbors' and 'look East' policies, and an important and effective member of Raisi’s cabinet, it is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who ultimately directs Iran's foreign policy, said Prof Kamrava. But the regime may face challenges in getting a vote of confidence from voters come June. The country's previous election in March this year saw its worst voter turnout since Iran's founding in 1979. Out of the country's 61 million eligible voters, only 41 per cent turned out to the polls. \"The Supreme Leader has been on public record asking citizens to vote because the elections is seen as a sign of legitimacy,\" said Prof Akbarzadeh on the previous elections. \"Now asked again to choose another President... the outcome might be another slap in the face for the Islamic regime in terms of voter turnout.\" WHAT IS THE BROADER IMPLICATION ON THE WORLD? There are two possible scenarios that could play out from the deaths of Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian. The first scenario, and what experts deem is most likely, is that the crash will be declared an unfortunate accident. In this scenario, the impact on the country, the Middle Eastern region and the rest of the world is little to none. While Iran will have to deal with its upcoming elections, domestic and foreign policy will not see drastic change, if any at all. \"Any impact on Iran's relations with Singapore is likely to be minimal, at least in the short-term,\" said Prof Kamrava. \"Trade and relations between the two countries are not very extensive, and it is unlikely there will be major changes in their existing relationship.\" The second scenario is that Iran blames Israel for the accident, whether or not that may be true. The two countries have long butted heads. Most recently, following the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct 7 last year, Israel blamed Iran for its support of Hamas. After Israel attacked the Iranian consulate in Damascus, the capital of Syria, the Islamic Republic retaliated by launching hundreds of missiles and drones in April. \"Given the close ties between Azerbaijan and Israel, and given that the crash occurred near the Iran-Azerbaijan border, it is possible that Tehran may declare that Israel was somehow responsible for the crash,\" said Dr Mark N. Katz, professor of government and politics at George Mason Univeristy's Schar School of Policy and Government. \"If so, then Iran will feel compelled to launch some sort of attack on Israel, and Israel will respond in kind.\" This might cause a \"prolonged, inconclusive conflict\" with some Middle Eastern states jumping into the fray. Sunni Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will likely seek to stay out of the conflict if this happens. But oil prices might rise, affecting the rest of the world and Singapore. But like other experts, Prof Akbarzadeh said this second scenario is highly unlikely. \"If by chance, Iranian authorities blame Israel, they would... be effectively declaring war on Israel. I don't think Iranian authorities would be interested in pursuing that line,\" he said. \"There has been no indication that the helicopter crash is due to foul play.\" Related topics Iran Middle East Read more of the latest in News Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-bRHgN1x4gCQ')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-AXeZCMxMtHc')); Trending Content is loading...

The post on a r/askSingapore thread was put up on Wednesday (May 22) and had received more than 850 likes as of Thursday. The woman said that she was struggling to soothe her four-month-old who was cranky and flailing about while walking towards an MRT station. That was when a stranger offered to help her. \"Coincidentally, she was heading to the same station as I was so she helped me with my pram until I reached my destination,\" wrote the woman, who goes by the username \"Any_String_811\". Thanking the stranger for making her day, the woman noted that such acts of kindness are \"hard to come by\". \"So when a stranger goes out of their way to help me it really tugs at my heartstrings,\" she wrote. She said that even when she was nine months pregnant, people often did not give up their seat — though she added that she did not expect them to as she would have taken a taxi if she needed a seat. At the end of her post, the woman asked other Reddit users to share their own stories and \"spread some kindness\". More than 130 comments were left under the woman's post. Most users described their encounters with good-hearted people, while others commended such random acts of kindness. These encounters included strangers going above and beyond, while others were of simple words of comfort — all of which left a lasting impression on these social media users. One user wrote about a driver for ride-hailing platform Grab who had left her some words of advice and a pack of tissues. She had been crying in her car after she broke up with her boyfriend who had cheated on her. \"At the end of the ride, he offered me a pack of tissues and sympathetically told me that 'tomorrow will be better',\" the person added. \"Although he’s a stranger and didn’t know what happened, his gesture really warmed my heart and it helped me more than he knew.\" Another user had a chance encounter with a man at Queen Street Bus Terminal. While waiting for a bus headed to Johor Bahru, Malaysia, he realised he did not have enough small change for the ride. \"I was asking around for change when this person just offered to give me the full amount for the ride without being paid back,\" the Reddit user said. \"He said that it happened to him before and he was paying it forward as someone had helped to pay for his trip in the past.\" While comments were mostly positive, some also lamented moments when they wished they had met someone who could have lent a helping hand. One said: \"Nobody offered to help when there was a SimplyGo card top-up error and the bus driver chased me off the bus. I was forced to walk for hours to get home.\" Regardless, the flood of stories touched the hearts of many social media users — with some calling for such posts to be more common on Reddit as a pick-me-up.

In a statement on Thursday, national water agency PUB said that the three men are sub-contractors and were found unconscious at around 11.15am at Singapore's second-largest waterworks along Nanyang Drive. \"Preliminary investigations indicate that the workers had inhaled hydrogen sulphide, a gas produced from sludge which is a by-product of the water treatment process,\" PUB added. The agency said that all three workers were taken unconscious to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. One of them, a 40-year-old Indian national who worked as a cleaning operations manager, died in hospital. The other two, a pair of Malaysian general workers aged 24 and 39, were still in intensive care. Hydrogen sulphide is a colourless gas that is extremely flammable and highly toxic. It is known for its strong odour of rotten eggs. In response to CNA's queries, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that it is investigating the incident and has instructed PUB to stop all tank cleaning works. \"As a general safety measure, proper ventilation must be provided to prevent accumulation of toxic vapours,\" MOM said. \"Workers must also be protected from excessive exposure to toxic vapours by equipping them with gas monitoring devices, and the appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirator mask and breathing apparatus.\" PUB said that it is in touch with the contractors and will render support to the workers' family members. \"PUB expresses our deepest condolences to the deceased's family,\" the agency said. \"Safety and health at all our workplaces are of utmost importance to PUB. We will cooperate fully with the investigation. \"As a precaution, PUB has called a safety timeout for similar operations in confined spaces and is reviewing the associated safety measures.\" In response to TODAY's queries, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it was alerted to the incident at about 11.25am on Thursday. \"SCDF firefighters and HazMat (Hazardous Material) specialists wearing personal protective equipment, including breathing apparatus sets, entered the premises and identified the presence of a hazardous vapour — hydrogen sulphide.\" Two water jets were used to disperse the vapour. The three workers were unconscious en route to the hospital and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) had to be performed on one of them. SCDF did not state if the worker who died was the same one who received CPR. No hydrogen sulphide was detected at the site after the water jets were used for an hour, SCDF added.

The 128-page antitrust lawsuit was joined by 29 US state and district attorneys general on Thursday (May 23), alleging that Live Nation and Ticketmaster used anti-competitive practices that have stifled the concert and ticketing industry. The US government alleges that the anti-competitive practices have resulted in concert-goers facing high ticket prices and has prohibited innovation and competition. Through the lawsuit, the US hopes that Live Nation will be ordered to divest \"at minimum\" Ticketmaster and cease any anti-competition behaviour. US lawmakers have long accused Live Nation of engaging in such practices. Early last year, a congressional hearing was held on issues that fans faced while trying to buy tickets for pop singer Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour. Fans in Singapore also encountered similar problems . In response to the civil suit on Thursday, Mr Dan Wall, executive vice-president of corporate and regulatory affairs at Live Nation, said that the lawsuit does not address problems in the concert and ticketing industry, and wrongfully targets Live Nation and Ticketmaster. \"It ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from rising production costs, to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary ticket prices,\" Mr Wall wrote in a blog on the company's website. He added that the lawsuit is \"anti-business\". Does Live Nation own a monopoly, and how will this lawsuit affect Singapore's ticketing and concert scheme? WHAT THE LAWSUIT SEEKS TO ADDRESS Live Nation is essentially a one-stop shop for live entertainment — it provides promotional services, has ticketing services through Ticketmaster and owns several performance venues. The US government has accused Live Nation of dominating the industry through what IT called a \"self-reinforcing 'flywheel'\". If venues did not use Ticketmaster's services, they risked losing access to Live Nation-managed performances and tours — which can be a costly mistake. Celebrities such as rapper Post Malone have had their concerts produced by Live Nation, while pop stars Taylor Swift and Beyonce have had their sold-out tours promoted by the entertainment giant. It is not just the venues — the complaint alleged that performers also had to use Live Nation's promotional services or they would not be able to perform at their venues. This ecosystem allegedly made it increasingly expensive for industry competitors. And with a lack of competition, the US claimed that Ticketmaster had no incentive to invest into its systems. Lacking competition also means that Live Nation could charge consumers several fees — which the lawsuit called \"Ticketmaster Tax\" — such as service fees, facility fees, payment processing fees and more. \"These strategies are part of a deliberate and defensive series of actions and decisions designed to lock up venues, lock out competitors, and hold the industry hostage from innovation and evolution,\" the US said in its lawsuit. IS LIVE NATION A MONOPOLY? In 2010, the US Department of Justice approved a merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster but with several conditions to ensure that the conglomerate would not act anti-competitively. The antitrust decree was to ensure that Live Nation could not retaliate against a venue for using another ticketing service besides Ticketmaster, among other things. After the merger, Live Nation grew to become, in its own words, the \"largest live entertainment company in the world\". It was accused of anti-competitive behaviour in 2019 by the US Justice Department, but it reached a settlement that was not disclosed. In the latest lawsuit, it was stated that Live Nation manages more than 400 musical artists and controls 265 concert venues in North America, including more than 60 of the top 100 amphitheatres in the US. Through Ticketmaster, it controls about 80 per cent of major concert venues' ticketing for concerts. Live Nation reported on May 3 that revenue rose 21 per cent to US$3.8 billion (S$5.13 billion) for the first quarter ended March 31 this year. This was well above earlier estimates of US$3.26 billion. Even though facts and figures such as these have spurred US legislators to describe the entertainment giant as an monopoly, it disagrees. Mr Wall of Live Nation said on Thursday that it does not derive its profits from \"monopoly pricing\", stating that the company's service charges are no higher than other ticketing sites such as SeatGeek and AXS. \"In fact, when Ticketmaster loses a venue to SeatGeek, service charges usually go up substantially,\" Mr Wall added. \"And even accounting for sponsorship, an advertising business that helps keep ticket prices down, Live Nation’s overall net profit margin is at the low end of profitable S&P 500 companies.\" The S&P 500 is a list of the country's top 500 companies. WILL SINGAPORE BE AFFECTED? Depending on the outcome of the US Department of Justice lawsuit, concert-goers here could be affected. If the outcome resulted in greater industry competition, this could pressure Ticketmaster to charge less for its services, which could mean that performing artistes are in a position to charge lower ticket prices for concert-goers. Dr Hannah Chang, an associate professor of marketing at the Singapore Management University, said that should the lawsuit result in the need for concerts to engage several ticketing platforms, it might be more complicated for concert-goers to buy tickets. This could also hurt artistes. \"Such issues are likely to be limited for megastars like Taylor Swift or Jay Chou where their fans will find a way (to buy their tickets),\" she added. \"For others — and particularly for emerging artistes — there may be benefits to being able to reach global audiences through one single platform, rather than through a mixture of platforms. \"For instance, if each concert uses a different platform, ticketing processes across languages and currencies are likely to be harder to standardise.\" The impact of the lawsuit might be limited here though — Live Nation's hold on the Singapore concert industry is arguably smaller than in the US. For one thing, it does not own any venue in Singapore, unlike in the US. While it is unclear if Ticketmaster has exclusive rights to provide its services at any venues, it does not have exclusivity for Singapore's National Stadium and Indoor Stadium, which have capacities of 55,000 and 12,000 respectively. A 2019 press release stated that it is one of three ticketing agents allowed to operate at the locations. The other two ticketing agents are Sistic and Australia's Ticketek. Ultimately, the impact will depend on the lawsuit's outcome — which could take years.

Young Singaporeans are stacking internships in a bid to stand out as competition heats up in the job market — but are the real fruits of their efforts going entirely to companies that benefit from their cheap labour? While the pressure may be real, says this TODAY journalist, youths should take care they don't wear themselves out before they even join the rat race. By Loraine Lee By Loraine Lee Published June 20, 2024 Updated June 21, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Is more always better? Eating too much food could give you a bad stomachache. Buying too many clothes means having less to spend or save. Taking on too much work is a one-way road to burnout. So is there such a thing as \"too many\" internships? A growing number of students have joined the internship arms race , with some taking as many as 10 internships in two years, reported TODAY reported on Friday (June 14). This phenomenon sparked some debate online, with many wondering if young people are launching themselves into the rat race too early. FEAR OF FALLING BEHIND In TODAY's latest Big Read penned by yours truly, the young people said that they had taken on multiple internships for various reasons, such as to increase their chances of landing a better job or to gain more real-world experience — but largely because they're worried about standing out with the intense competition in the job market. Their concerns had some readers lamenting the situation and wondering if the young are falling victim to peer pressure. Someone on online forum Reddit, for example, wrote about having two interns who took on multiple internships during their school term but each still had plans for another internship once their summer break started. \"The whole team tried to convince them to chill and take it easy during (university) like we did,\" this Reddit user said, \"but I guess this arms race mentality is hard to break cause of fomo (fear of missing out).\" Another online user, who implied that he or she is now studying at a university, pointed out that most young people don't have much of a choice when it comes to that sense of fomo, because taking on internships is a requirement to graduate in most institutes of higher learning. \"I would love for nothing more than to actually travel for extended periods during my summer breaks, but I have to intern for the credits and for the resume,\" the online user said. Several said that, left unchecked, this intensifying sense of pressure and competition could send young people down a never-ending spiral, eventually playing an active role in worsening mental health struggles for this generation. Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Tertiary students are increasingly hungry for internship opportunities outside of school requirements. QUALITY MATTERS MORE On the other hand, another camp of responders said that the real winners of young Singaporeans' growing internship addiction are corporations that benefit from their cheap labour. After all, though not all firms are paying peanuts — some investment banking firms have reportedly offered internship salaries of up to S$10,000 — interns are generally paid less than their full-time counterparts. The National University of Singapore recommends an allowance of at least S$800 to S$1,000, for example. This is a fraction of the median gross monthly salary for fresh graduates in full-time permanent employment of S$4,313, based on the 2023 Joint Autonomous Universities Graduate Employment Survey. Pay aside, several people said it is more important that students have a quality internship experience rather than allowing themselves to be roped into an endless grind. One online user said: \"Employers, 'success' influencers and bigwigs are 100 per cent snickering with glee at what they've created — a race for youngsters to be taken advantage o... If you get an internship make sure you're getting something out of it.\" Another online user said that internships are not like Pokemon in that you don't need to catch 'em all: \"Spamming low-value (internships) only serve to dilute your real achievements instead.\" A RACE TO NOWHERE? Most readers, though, acknowledged that internships do have their benefits: They help the youth discover their interests, strengths and working styles while gaining hands-on experience in real workplaces. Third-party opinions aside, perhaps the real crux of the internship arms race is that many Singaporean youth seem to be missing the point of internships. Instead of learning opportunities, a growing number of the young appear to be taking these as a way to one-up their peers in the job hunt by lengthening their resumes, rather than strengthening them. This mindset speaks to an overblown ideal of what a first job should be: High-paying position in a reputable company with countless work benefits, perhaps a fully stocked pantry and a Herman Miller chair at a desk in a building that forms part of Singapore's iconic skyline. However, realistically, a first job isn't the last job for most of these young people. There is still plenty of time and opportunity for them to work their way up the corporate ladder after they start their first full-time job, or even their second. Most schools have a mandatory graduation requirement of at least one internship, and that experience can be enough if it is fruitful. Beyond this, if young people want to take on multiple internship stints to explore their preferences and prospects, that's totally up to them. However, internships shouldn't be an internment — people should do it for reasons that will truly help them grow and find their way, and not just because they feel trapped by external or perceived pressures. If there's anything I have learnt from my own experience in the working world, preparing for any race is just as important as running the race itself — you shouldn't exhaust yourself before you graduate and join the rat race.

By Amanda Yeap By Amanda Yeap Published May 12, 2024 Updated May 29, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — The memory of being \"abandoned\" by her mother to a guardian during her childhood is still vivid even now for 26-year-old Cynthia Ong. Recalling the incident that has been seared in her mind, Ms Ong said that after her parents divorced when she was seven and her mother won custody of her, her mother dropped her off at a family friend’s house one day. “And then she didn’t come back,” Ms Ong told TODAY. Her mother simply told her at the time that she needed to go off and buy something — and did not return until a month later. That then became the routine: Her mother would show up just once a month. “I asked her where she went and she said she was busy working. She picked me up on some weekends to go out and I always told her that I didn’t want to go back (to the guardian’s house). “She thought I was just throwing tantrums,” Ms Ong said. “The guardian was abusive, too. The family didn’t send me to school. I had to take my meals outside the house, so I had to stand and eat. I could go back in only after I had finished my food.” A year later from the first day she was dropped off at the guardian's house, Ms Ong’s mum realised the seriousness of the situation when she got a call from her daughter's registered primary school, saying that she had not attended classes. Ms Ong later moved into a rental flat, where she lived with her mother until she was 13, before eventually moving in with her father and brother, who is six years younger. Today, Ms Ong is a sales and marketing executive and a mother of two boys who are four and three years old. And on her most tired days — between handling a full-time job and caring for two children without hired help in the form of a domestic worker — she cannot imagine being separated from her children for unspecified long periods or letting them experience what she went through as a child. She has vowed not to be like her mother. Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Ms Cynthia Ong looking at drawings done by her sons. Without a close relationship with her mother and no longer in contact with her, Ms Ong said that she had no one in the family to turn to when she became a parent. This was especially when she was having pregnancy pains and recuperating during the confinement period after birth. BURNT OUT AND LOOKING FOR CONNECTIONS Later, in finding ways to cope with burnout and frustrated with feeling alone, she began filming videos of herself last July and posting them on video-sharing application TikTok under the handle \"@tiredgenzmom\". Hoping to get some connection with other parents, Ms Ong began posting about her evening routine as a working mum, cleaning up the house and having playtime with the children. She did the \"Day in My Life\" vlogs on TikTok, a trend that gained popularity two years ago, documenting her life before and after work and how she and her husband spend time with the children. \"After the kids go to sleep at 10pm, I have two to three hours of 'me time'... That's when I'll find some time to edit my videos,\" she said. The responses were mostly positive, with some users voicing their support for her. Others wrote to say that it was nice to see a fellow mother having similar routines as them. Ms Ong finds it comforting that people are able to relate to her experiences as a working mother in Singapore. “They can come and talk about their tiredness and experience of being a mum. I hope they see my content and think, ‘Eh, there are also mums going through this. I’m not alone’. “The ultimate goal is to bring together a community of mums who feel this is their safe space.\" Right now, she has more than 35,000 followers on TikTok watching videos of her everyday life, which are published on her account once every two to four days. In one video, a TikTok user commented: “Y’all look like such cool parents. It makes me feel like I want to have kids, too.” Another one said: \"Wow... you got energy to clean till 1230am. Salute you, mummy.\" Her most viral video, posted in March, now has more than 2.3 million views. It shows her returning home on a Friday at around 6.30pm, then showering her sons when they got home, having dinner that was delivered to their flat, going out as a family of four to buy groceries, going home to eat waffles that they had bought and getting some playtime in, putting her children to sleep, putting away cleaned laundry and then her own bedtime at around midnight. Ms Ong said that she was surprised by the reactions she got to her videos. “You know, the content that I film, I think much of them are almost identical, just that I’m wearing different clothes every day. “I think because of my account name (a tired Gen Z mum), a lot of my viewers are Gen Zers who are curious. They’ll tell me that my life is ‘very cool’ and that they also want to be like me when they become a mum one day,” she added, saying that these comments warm her heart. As for concerns of \"sharenting\" , or over-sharing her parenting experience online and compromising the safety and privacy of her young children, she said: \"I am very conscious of what I post about them. I don't talk about their names, about the location of their schools and I don't show them when they are throwing tantrums and not feeling their best.\" WHY SHE WANTED TO BE A YOUNG PARENT Coming from a broken family and having spent most of her childhood and adolescence split between her parents’ homes, Ms Ong has a clear vision of the parent she aspires to be and the level of attentiveness she intends to offer her children. “I will always tell myself that I’ll never, ever let my children go through what I did.” On her decision to be a young parent — she got married at the age of 21 and had her first child at 22 — she said: “Some people found it odd that I would choose to have kids after having a difficult childhood . But to me, I want to have a loving family for myself because this was something I never had.” Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Ms Cynthia Ong pictured with her husband Nicholas Tan and two sons. Ms Ong added that it was her dream to embrace motherhood at a young age, because she wanted to have the energy to actively engage and play with her children during their formative years. And when they grow older, she envisions herself becoming a \"cool mum\" figure, fostering a relationship with her children that is characterised by open communication and friendship. Ms Ong likes to think that her parenting style is somewhere in between Asian parenting and gentle parenting. Asian parenting takes on an authoritarian approach, often enforcing strict rules and punishment for wrongdoings. Gentle parenting prioritises empathy and positive discipline techniques such as problem-solving together as a family. “I try my best to find a balance,\" Ms Ong said. \"If they do something wrong, I will talk to them to make them understand what I’m saying and give them three chances. “If they still do it after three times, then I know they’re trying to be funny, and only then will I scold them and discipline them.” She admitted that managing her emotions can be tough on some days due to work stress and fatigue. At the same time, she is acutely aware of how a parent's strong and uncontrolled emotions can become a lasting bad memory to children, just like how some painful parts of her own childhood remain clear as day in her mind today. “Because of this, I have to exercise a lot of self-control and regulate my emotions constantly. I don’t want to go to sleep regretting what I did to my kids.” Ms Ong remembered that when she was dating Mr Nicholas Tan — now her husband — and told him that she wanted to be a mother early, he was a little surprised. “He likes to plan things first before doing them. At first, he told me we should wait a while before having our first child. “But to me, there is never a right time. We can wait a few years, but maybe there will be other reasons to tell ourselves that we should wait longer. So I convinced him we should do it as soon as possible.” Mr Tan eventually agreed with his wife since he also likes children and wanted to become a father. The 31-year-old sales manager of a car rental company told TODAY: \"It's more of a mutual decision rather than giving in (to my wife). I also see the benefits of being still 'young' when our children are 18.\" Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Ms Cynthia Ong pictured having some fun with her husband Nicholas Tan. Ms Ong said that as a young parent, she does not feel like she is missing out on anything as someone in her 20s. On the contrary, she feels like her life has a purpose now. “When I was younger, we never officially celebrated Mother’s Day or such commemorative days, even though I really wanted family time. My brother and I were always on our own. “Today, I have two sons and they're the reason I work so hard. \"They keep me motivated and I constantly want to be a better version of myself. \"If I were given a chance to go back in time, I would still choose to be a young mum. I have no regrets.” Related topics Mother's Day working mothers parenting children TikTok Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-GrZ0J-4ALd8')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-qm2yc165LJE')); Trending Content is loading...

Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently announced plans for having additional safeguards around excessive screen time for children This came amid a rise in mental health concerns worldwide among the younger generation Experts say that media use for children under two years old has been linked to developmental issues TODAY speaks to eight parents on their personal experiences and challenges in limiting screen time for their children By Sufiyan Samsuri By Sufiyan Samsuri Published May 13, 2024 Updated May 17, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Before having children, Ms Lily Khairunnisa and her husband had a vision of raising their future children in a completely \"screen-free\" environment, knowing well the potential harmful effects it could one day bring. But just two years after their first son was born, they came to realise that it was impossible to keep screens away from him, eventually turning to television as a tool to help keep him occupied. They now have three kids aged four, 10 and 11, with the latter two just receiving their own mobile phones a month ago. “We need that precious break to keep them quiet so we can do other things like prepping for an outing or even just going to the loo,” said 36-year-old Ms Lily, an investment business owner. “These pockets of breaks help keep us sane.” Last weekend, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that the Government would consider additional safeguards around excessive screen time and social media use for children, to protect the mental health of young people. He was speaking at a 55th anniversary event of suicide prevention centre Samaritans of Singapore. Mr Wong, a patron of the organisation, announced the plan amid an increase in mental health concerns among the younger generation worldwide. “Screen time during infancy adversely affects development of cognitive skills needed for self-regulation and learning, as well as socio-emotional competence as the child grows up. This in turn raises the risk of mental conditions, such as depression,” he said in his speech. TODAY spoke to eight parents who shared their views and challenges in limiting their children’s use of digital devices. While all agreed that too much screen time is bad for their children, some struggle to cap their usage. WHY DO PARENTS STILL GIVE KIDS SCREEN TIME WHEN IT’S BAD? Like Ms Lily, Mr Derrick Yuen and his wife let their daughter watch nursery rhyme videos while Mrs Yuen does household chores. The 51-year-old data consultant said that it was more about setting a clear, practical rule from the beginning — that screen time is only for whenever it is necessary, but not avoiding it entirely. He limits the use of electronic devices only for school-related activities and does not allow his three children to be on social media. “My wife and I wanted our children to have less screen time, not no screen time — given the state of our world today, it would be difficult and impractical,” said Mr Yuen. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Data consultant Derrick Yuen, 51, accompanies his nine-year-old twin sons and 12-year-old daughter as they do their schoolwork at home on May 10, 2024. Agreeing, Ms Christine Mah, a workspace services manager, said that the moving images and music in videos have helped her then two-year-old daughter to learn nursery rhymes better. “When faced with the various needs of the child and the grandparents who helped raise her, we had to adapt to the changing situations and environment, and to strike a balance between limiting (device) use and meaningful exposure,” she said. For 40-year-old Archita Biswas, it felt like she had “no choice” but to allow her daughter, when she was one year old, to have screen time to ensure she eats. Her daughter is 13 now. Ms Archita said: “She was never a co-operative eater, so the Disney Junior channel was our saviour. When we switched on the television, at least we were able to feed her a few spoons.” Together with her husband, Mr Vedha Giri, they gradually engaged in “friendly discussions” that do not “sound like a lecture” with their daughter on the health effects of excessive screen time. Ms Lily said that limiting her children’s screen time came with challenges. “My parents and siblings would sometimes offer their phones to my kids even though I've told them that I do not want screen time for them. I would usually just close one eye in these situations.” She added that due to excessive screen times, her children would sometimes throw unnecessary tantrums and show a lack of social awareness, such as not responding to others who call for them. Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Ms Lily Khairunnisa, 36, limits the screentime of her three children, Affan, 11, Mairah, 10, and Abbas, 4, and encourage them to read books instead. They are seen here in their home on May 8, 2024. WHAT CAN THE GOVERNMENT DO? Like the rest of the parents interviewed, 50-year-old IT project manager and father of three Maheswaran Subramaniam supports the idea of having additional safeguards on excessive screen time, but he believes that parents still play an important role. Fellow IT professional Ghazali Maricar, 53, agreed that “everyone can support a common cause” if safeguards are publicly available, instead of just parents taking it upon themselves. Family life educator and consultant Esther Foong-Tan, 39, suggested looking into equipping and resourcing parents with alternative ways to engage children aged four and below. “Residents' committees or community centres can organise age-appropriate activities in the neighbourhood for parents to easily bring their children for hours of fun, or forming wholesome and positive parent communities that can share resources and ideas,” said Ms Foong-Tan , who also co-founded parents support group SGFamilies. “These can help to free up time for parent-child interactions, as well as manage the stress of parenting.” Ms Siti Raudah, a 39-year-old teacher and mother of two daughters aged three and five, said that children need to be exposed to more play-based interactions with peers of the same age, be it in school or at home. “Game advertisements on YouTube should also be minimised so that their attention will not be diverted to wanting to download these apps,” she added. Mr Yuen raised concerns on the use of electronic devices as learning tools in schools at a young age. “As it stands, I feel that MOE's (Ministry of Education) plan to expose children to mobile devices and the internet in primary school is too early as they are not mature enough and lack self-regulation, especially the boys,” said Mr Yuen. Echoing this sentiment, Ms Archita said: “While the safeguards are good, I feel the Government should also stop the usage of learning devices like iPads and Chromebooks in schools as children are using them for a prolonged period, and it is affecting their eye health. They are also diverted to websites that have no links to schoolwork.” Esther Foong-Tan Ms Esther Foong-Tan, 39, poses for a family photo with husband Elvin, son Nathan, and daughter Phoebe. WHAT EXPERTS SAY Ms Melissa Goh, a senior lecturer of the early childhood education programme at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, said that studies have shown links between media use for children under two years old and developmental issues like delays in learning languages. Screen time or screen-based learning offers a more passive experience of learning that limits benefits across cognitive, social, emotional and physical domains, she added. “I would recommend that parents limit the duration and filter the type of media that the child watches by opting for educational shows that are age-appropriate and depict real-life experiences and scenes.” She also proposed counter measures such as having breaks and ensuring that the child has a decent amount of time outdoors and playing with toys or physical objects. Dr Jason Gan, a lecturer in the same programme, said that the Government should engage parents and caregivers and raise their awareness on the issue. “They should specifically address gaps in understanding the implications of excessive screen time and educate parents on utilising 'parental controls' within digital devices.” He also proposed having a national movement such as a \"no screen hour\", which can be an effective way of raising awareness and promoting reduced screen time.

That left quite an impression on me,” said Mr Lee, who has held various senior positions in the civil service. For Mr Lee, this memory reflects Mr Wong’s industriousness — one of the upcoming prime minister’s most memorable traits since his younger days. “He was probably one of the first to be in office, and the last to leave,” said Mr Lee, who now chairs the Chandler Institute of Governance. People who have previously interacted with or worked in various capacities with Mr Wong, including grassroot members, civil servants and a former teacher of his, painted a picture of a leader with an eye for policy details yet clear-headed in big-picture thinking, and a boss who has high standards yet is nurturing to those under his charge. As an individual, they described Singapore’s next prime minister as someone who is naturally introverted yet approachable, and one who has grown comfortable in his public persona. Despite the years that have passed, they said that what remains constant of Mr Wong is how grounded he is and how he has always put the public before himself. POLICY WONK Many who have worked with Mr Wong describe him as highly capable and a policy wonk — one who takes interest in intricate details of a policy. Mr Lee recalled how Mr Wong took it upon himself to be certified Chartered Financial Analyst, a rigorous professional certification that was not needed for his role, despite the heavy workload he shouldered at MOF and the certification not being a necessity for his role. “He was already well-qualified for that role. But he just wanted the technical certificate, to get his hands dirty in the very technical aspects of finance,” said Mr Lee. Mr Wong was a Public Service Commission scholar who earned his bachelor and masters degrees in economics in the United States before he began working in the public service. Mr Ong Kian Ann, also one of Mr Wong’s former staffers at MOF in the early 2000s, remembered how the division had to engage economic professors to develop econometric models. “Throughout the discussion and conversation (with the professors), what struck me was that my boss, at his age then (of about 30), I would say, was in the same league as the professors, with their experience in the industry,” said Mr Ong. lawrencewongst/Instagram Mr Ong Kian Ann (right) seen with Mr Lawrence Wong and their MOF fiscal planning unit colleagues in 2000. Mr Tan Meng Dui, chief executive of the Housing and Development Board (HDB), said that Mr Wong’s “very good grasp of policy considerations and details” made him “quite easy to work with”. Mr Tan was deputy secretary at the Ministry of National Development from 2014 to 2018. Mr Wong headed the ministry from 2015 to 2020. “This is especially so for public housing, where there are fiscal implications to consider and the housing needs and aspirations of the different segments of our population can be quite different,” he added. CLEAR-HEADED STRATEGIC THINKER While he demonstrated a sharp eye for details, Mr Wong never lost sight of the bigger picture and was described as clear headed on the strategic level, too. Mr Wong Siew Hoong, who was director-general for education at the Ministry of Education, recollected how there was robust debate around the introduction of blended learning in schools. After the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, blended learning was introduced in schools, where home-based learning was incorporated as a regular part of the school calendar. With strong arguments both for and against the proposal, the issue was further complicated by the implications it would have on students, teachers, schools and even parents. “You can see his mind working, weighing the different issues, the ups and the downs and then of course to make the political decision,” said the senior advisor at MOE. “It was very clear in his mind: If it’s good for students, we should do it.” Professor Tan Thiam Soon, former President of Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) remembered a conversation he had with Mr Wong back in 2012. As then Minister of State for Education, Mr Wong had chaired an MOE committee set up to review university expansion pathways. The committee recommended making the SIT a full-fledged university. Prof Tan was the vice provost of education at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and was approached by MOE to move to SIT. Before he made his decision, the professor asked to speak to someone about some concerns he had and was told to meet Mr Wong. “He doesn't throw at you lofty ideas, lofty words that could be interpreted in any direction, like a motherhood statement,” said Prof Tan. “He was clear about what he felt Singapore needed going forward, how (SIT) fit into the bigger picture. And even at that point, in 2012, he was clear about how the education landscape was going to change with the onset of technology disruptions.” Prof Tan added: \"That's why I've been here (at SIT) for the last 12 years. If he had said anything else, I could have still stayed at NUS.\" HIGH EXPECTATIONS, BUT NURTURING He was also described by some as a leader with high standards. Ms Zing Lim Tse Yin, former deputy director in the MND Housing Division from 2015 to 2020, said: “He would not take input at face value, and would seek to understand the underlying rationale and sentiment. This encouraged healthy discussions and robust outcomes.” Agreeing, Mr Tan said: “DPM (Wong) is disarming and quite unintimidating for a very senior leader. But you do want to be well prepared for discussions with him. “He would often make counter proposals, and may have some ideas of his own or would suggest other areas to look at. So, it is important to be rigorous and comprehensive in making a policy recommendation or preparing for a discussion with him.” Mr Wong was one who, when he spotted any mistakes, would take time to explain to those under him what went wrong and how it could be done better. “He is always willing to coach. That has been his trademark (trait) since about 20 years ago,” said Mr Ong. That spirit carried over even to the grassroots, said some volunteers. Ms Prema Suresh, chairperson of the Indian Activity Executive Committee at Limbang, where Mr Wong is the Member of Parliament, said that while it was common for organisers to feel nervous when a high-profile guest of honour graces an event, Mr Wong never made them feel that way. “If there’s a mistake, he would allow us to make it and learn from it, and get it done better,” she said. CONSULTATIVE, OPEN TO CRITICISM Mr Wong’s leadership style was commonly described by those who have worked with him as open and consultative, rather than top down. “He explained his thoughts and concerns clearly, shared candidly about his struggles with difficult issues, and was always open to opinions and ideas from anyone in the room,” said Ms Lim, who is now director for rental housing at HDB. Agreeing, Mr Tan said Mr Wong would listen to views from people regardless of their seniority — “often actively asking for views or other ideas” — before making a decision or giving guidance. Prof Tan of SIT recalled how during his conversation back in 2012, Mr Wong spent a fair amount of time listening to the professor’s concerns instead of just laying out his own vision for the university. “What also struck me that day was, he actually genuinely listened to me. I would say he listened more than he talked in our meeting,” said Prof Tan. INTROVERTED, YET APPROACHABLE Those who worked with him in the early part of his career described him as being generally shy and introverted. Based on their impression of his public appearances, they commented that he has since grown to become more comfortable in the public eye. What has remained constant though, is that Mr Wong is someone who “has no airs around him”, they said. Ms Prema cited how Mr Wong sportingly joined residents in doing a folk dance at an event last year. “He himself said: ‘Hey, let’s come and join the residents and dance’. It was a very memorable thing, not just for me but for those at the event,” she said. Lawrence Wong/Facebook Mr Lawrence Wong taking part in Tamil New Year celebrations with Ms Prema Suresh (right) in Limbang, April 15, 2023. Mr Shi Wei Fei, a youth network volunteer at Limbang, also recalled a light-hearted moment he shared with Mr Wong. The university student was the emcee for two community events that fell on the same day. Mr Wong had attended both events, on top of a few other engagements in between. “When he saw me at the second event, he quipped: ‘Wow, you provide full-time emcee service?’. I Imagined he must have felt more tired than me; he didn’t have to joke with me, but he did,” said Mr Shi. Mr Lee, formerly from MOF, said that Mr Wong could remember the office attendants by name and chatted with them. “The office attendants, the aunties in the office, they all liked him a lot. He has good relations at all levels,” said Mr Lee. Some who have worked with him before said Mr Wong would still address them by name and asked how they are doing when they bump into each other at events, even if they have not worked closely with each other for years. According to a former teacher, his affability was apparent from his school days. Mrs Pang Lay Har, who taught Mr Wong civics and mathematics at Victoria Junior College, recalled how he got along well with his classmates, who came from diverse backgrounds. \"He exuded a warm presence, coupled with humility and sincerity,\" said Mrs Pang, who is now vice-principal of Tampines Meridian Junior College. The educator also recalled Mr Wong as a well-rounded student who excelled in his studies — \"he would ask questions and contribute good ideas\" from his usual seat near the back of the class, she said — and in his co-curricular activity, choir. And while the public probably only took notice of Mr Wong's musical talent after he became a high-profile figure, Mrs Pang knew of his skills some 30 years ago. \"He had a flair for music, and I fondly remember being pleasantly surprised when he came to see me with the classmates to sing me a song during Teachers’ Day, and he was playing the guitar,\" she recounted. GROUNDED, PEOPLE FIRST Mrs Pang also recalled a conversation she had with the young Mr Wong when he was seeking her advice on scholarships. \"We spoke about commitment and serving the bond that comes with the scholarship. What impressed me was that he was thinking about how he could contribute and serve the community. I knew then this was a promising young man whose heart was in the right place,\" she said. Those who worked with him at the grassroots level mentioned how Mr Wong sets aside time for his residents, despite wearing many hats. For example, Limbang has eight residents’ network groups that would typically hold their own celebration for a festive holiday. “Sometimes they fall on the same day. So he would be here, and an hour later he would be there (at another one). He tries his best to be with the residents at such festive events,” said Ms Prema. Mr Shi of Limbang Youth Network describes Mr Wong as an MP who takes residents’ feedback very seriously. During the Covid-19 pandemic, resident engagement sessions were held over Zoom and organised by blocks. One resident raised an issue to Mr Wong, who dealt with it promptly, said the volunteer. “The resident (some time later) hopped on the Zoom call meant for residents of another block, just to personally say to Mr Wong, ‘Thank you, my problem is resolved’,” he said. This was one example of perhaps one of the key traits that Mr Wong had as a leader: One who puts the community over self. “DPM Wong has a big heart — even as prudence and parity are key concerns in policymaking, above all his top concern was to be progressive,” said Ms Lim. Mr Ong, formerly from MOF, said: “As economists, of course you can make big money in the financial sector. But he chose to be in the public service. “He chose to serve because he wants to use his skill set to see how he can shape and form policy for the greater good of Singaporeans as a whole.” Prof Tan said Mr Wong possesses many qualities that make him “the ideal man” for the politics of this era, which is more centered on inclusivity and a disavowal of elitism. “The ability to be humble, the ability not to say I know everything, but to listen to the people and bring their perspectives to the policy — I think it will bring great strengths in what could be a very challenging and difficult time for him and for all of us,” he said.

Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. While all Singaporeans are coping with hotter weather, low-income communities are especially vulnerable, with cooling solutions like air-conditioning often out of reach As temperatures rise, some rental residents said they turn to makeshift, creative solutions like spraying ice water on the walls or showering up to four times a day to stay cool The heat has taken a physical, mental and financial toll on many, as some said their electricity and water bills have doubled or the heat has directly affected their income Climate experts emphasised that while low-income communities are often least responsible for causing climate change, they are most susceptible to its effects By Nikki Yeo By Nikki Yeo Published May 18, 2024 Updated May 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — For 34-year-old homemaker Logeswari, who lives with five children in a two-room public rental flat in Bedok, the recent spate of very hot weather has made life harder in several ways: The nausea from her pregnancy feels more unbearable, her utility bills have doubled and her five-year-old son scratches himself throughout the night because of the heat. She and her children have eczema, which has been exacerbated by the hot and humid conditions and increased sweating. As the mercury climbed in the past three months, she bought a portable air conditioner secondhand for around S$200, though running it through the day has raised her electricity bills from S$90 a month to around S$200 now. \"For this kind of unit, this is considered quite high. I'm quite worried if prices keep increasing,\" said Ms Logeswari, who goes by only one name. As Singaporeans have had to deal with increasingly hot weather on a regular basis, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) launched Singapore’s first Heat Stress Advisory last July, to guide the population on how to minimise the risk of heat-related illness. In conversations with rental flat residents and low-income workers, TODAY found that low-income families such as Ms Logeswari's are finding it extra tough to do so. Their living conditions make the discomfort more palpable, while steps they take to combat the heat are leading to heavy utility bills they can hardly afford. Most of them do not have in-unit air conditioners as residents of Government-subsidised rental flats have to seek permission from the Housing and Development Board (HDB) before carrying out any renovation works, including the installation of air conditioners. The Ministry of National Development (MND) has said this in line with market practice, where tenants have to seek landlords’ permission before making changes to their units. In a written reply to parliamentary questions in July 2023 on whether air conditioners are allowed in HDB rental flats, the ministry said HDB considers such requests on a case-by-case basis. “While HDB does not track the number of requests to install air conditioners in public rental flats, only a small proportion of tenants have made such requests. HDB has generally approved such requests, taking into consideration tenants’ circumstances, such as medical grounds,\" MND said. More broadly, climate experts and activists around the world have noted that while vulnerable and low-income communities are often the least responsible for contributing to climate change, they disproportionately bear the negative effects . As extreme weather persists and heat stress emerges as a critical concern, they say it is important to see how low-income families here are coping with rising temperatures, and what can be done to build heat resilience among vulnerable communities. TAKING A TOLL ON HEALTH, FINANCES Because she and her kids suffer from eczema, Ms Logeswari received approval from HDB to install an air-conditioning unit. But she ultimately decided against it, as the combined cost of an air-conditioning unit, installation and monthly electricity bills were prohibitive. So she bought a portable air conditioner, but that has led to some angst too. \"The girls sleep in the room and the boys sleep outside. If I put (the portable air-conditioner) one way, it will trigger (fights), because they will say, 'How come they sleep in aircon and we cannot?'\" Ms Nor Aisyah, a 33-year-old homemaker with five children who lives in a two-room rental flat in Bedok, recently bought a portable air conditioner, too, for around S$500. This was very expensive for her, but she feels her children, aged six to 15, need it. The younger ones have become more susceptible to the common cold and fevers since the weather got hotter, she said, falling sick twice a month lately as infections easily spread in their close quarters. Since the purchase, her electricity bills have doubled to around S$50 a week because she runs the portable air conditioner for around three hours every night, she said, which eats into her budget for groceries and medical expenses. Staying cool is also a medical necessity for Ms Rosnah Md Tahir, 51, a retiree who lives in a two-room rental flat in Upper Boon Keng, as her diabetes makes her perspire easily, which then causes her to get heat rashes. She has started to bathe three to four times a day to keep cool, and runs two fans all day, causing her water and electricity bills to rise by S$50 a month. “It’s very hot and everything is expensive, so for people with low incomes, it does strain them. Even as we have received more rebates (from the Government) and we try to save, (prices) continue to go up,” said Ms Rosnah. For Ms Marlina Yased, a 45-year-old community worker who lives in a two-room rental flat with a family of six, creative solutions are the only means of staying cool. She puts ice cubes in spray bottles to cast water on the walls on hot days, which goes some way towards cooling the flat, although on some days the heat makes the water evaporate instantaneously, she said. “Outside it can be 38 degrees, but inside it is 42 degrees, because we’re covered by solar panels and the water tank is right above (our unit). The tap water (feels) like boiling water after 10am,” said Ms Marlina. In her family's small space, Ms Marlina said tensions inevitably rise on hotter days, as the “heat is doubled” when she cooks, and she has noticed her daughters also feeling more frustrated as there are more limits to how girls and women can adapt their dressing to the weather. “Men can wear boxers (when it’s hot), but if we women want to do the same and go outside, people will complain.” Nuria Ling/TODAY Ms Marlina Yased and her family live in a two-room rental flat. Meanwhile, those who work outdoors say the heat has affected their earnings. Food delivery rider Peter Yeo, 52, is not a rental flat tenant but his work requires him to be exposed to the weather most of the time. When the NEA ultraviolet index hit extreme levels in March, he decided to work at night, as the sun made his skin feel “very painful”. But this caused his earnings to dip. “My earnings were affected tremendously as the midnight orders may (involve) very far pickups, and I have to reject the orders,” said Mr Yeo, who carries out deliveries on a power-assisted bike. Nuria Ling/TODAY Generics of food delivery riders. MOST VULNERABLE AND SENSITIVE Ms Siti Nurani Salim, founder of Project Goodwill Aid, a volunteer group that conducts food distribution exercises in rental estates, has received more complaints from residents about the weather since February. The organisation has been assisting households to get fans and provides financial aid by topping up beneficiaries’ Pay-As-You-Use (PayU) accounts for their electricity bills. “It’s too hot, there are not enough fans for their homes. Some actually ask for portable coolers but we advise them that it will (lead to much higher) electricity bills,” said Ms Nurani. Being restricted to low-cost cooling solutions that are less effective, such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected during periods of extreme heat, said Associate Professor Jason Lee, who is director of the Heat Resilience and Performance Centre at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in the National University of Singapore (NUS). Additionally, many low-income individuals usually take on menial jobs which require “long-term exposure to extreme weather conditions”, he noted. They also have a higher tendency to work extremely hard to meet job-related quotas, even at the risk of their health, said Assoc Prof Lee. Agreeing, a spokesperson from SG Climate Rally, which organised a rally that saw over 1,400 attendees last September , said that climate change exposes low-income groups to “additional vulnerabilities” as many do not have the protection of working in an air-conditioned environment. “Their low income reduces the extent to which these communities can deal with the challenges posed by climate change. Rising food prices due to climate change-induced crop failures hurt lower-income families the most, because spending on necessities like food takes up a larger share of their budget,” said the spokesperson. Lower-income families are also more sensitive to the costs associated with mitigating the heat, as utility bills tend to take up a larger percentage of their household expenses, said Associate Professor Alberto Salvo, deputy head of research at the department of Economics at NUS. A 2018 study by Assoc Prof Salvo , which analysed the utility bills of over 100,000 households here, found that low-income households consumed much more water as temperatures rise. This is likely because lower-income families tend to rely on water, through taking more frequent, longer showers, to beat the heat, as they may not have air conditioning units or find them costly to operate. More affluent households, by contrast, reflected a marked increase in electricity demand and no significant change in water consumption when temperatures rise. A forthcoming study looking at how heat fluctuations affect economic activity in Singapore has found increased attendance and commuting to workplaces, malls and more air-conditioned schools on hotter days, particularly by low-income residents with limited access to cooling measures at home, said Assoc Prof Salvo. This shows that public infrastructure should be designed to help more vulnerable communities beat the heat in the long run, and more resources could be allocated to providing cooling facilities in common spaces that are accessible to all, experts said. For example, free-to-use air-conditioned community spaces like public libraries and community centres near rental estates, similar to the “haze sanctuaries” proposed in the event of extreme haze , could provide students and outdoor workers some relief in critically hot moments, such as the afternoon. WHAT AUTHORITIES ARE DOING In response to TODAY's queries to MSE and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), a Government spokesperson said that the authorities adopt a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy by: Implementing national-level cooling strategies, such as intensifying greenery and orientating blocks to optimise wind flow Strengthening the community’s resilience to adapt to heat and Deepening its scientific understanding of the impact of rising temperatures. The spokesperson pointed to the Heat Stress Advisory published in July 2023 as one way to strengthen the community’s resilience to heat. There is also the myENV app, which Singaporeans can use to monitor the prevailing heat stress levels before heading outdoors. To increase scientific understanding of changing weather, initiatives such as the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project are studying the impact of heat on different segments of the population, such as the elderly and children. It also assesses the effectiveness of various cooling strategies, such as the application of cool paints on the exterior of buildings. As for what is being done to help households defray utility bills, the Government spokesperson noted that eligible Singaporean households living in HDB flats can offset their utility expenses with the GST Voucher – U-Save and the Assurance Package (AP) U-Save. U-Save rebates for financial year 2024 are disbursed in the months of April, July, October this year and January next year. In total, as announced in Budget 2024 , eligible households will receive up to $950 in U-Save rebates this financial year. HDB households may also use climate vouchers provided under the Climate Friendly Households Programme , which offers HDB households S$300 worth of vouchers to offset the cost of buying climate-friendly appliances. Families in greater need who cannot meet their daily living expenses can receive additional assistance via ComCare, which provides clients with monthly cash assistance and help with their utility expenses, if needed, after accounting for U-Save rebates. \"The actual quantum of ComCare assistance is derived based on each family’s needs, so it will vary across families,\" the spokesperson said. \"ComCare clients who need more support can approach their nearest Social Service Office, where officers will look into how to assist the household holistically.\" MSF regularly reviews the ComCare assistance quanta to ensure that they remain relevant and adequate to meet the needs of lower-income families, the spokesperson added.

More than a third of Singaporeans aged 21 and above have untreated dental cavities and 94 per cent suffer from gum disease The popularity of crunchy, sugar-laden snacks and drinks are taking a toll on oral health Habits such as clenching and grinding of teeth, chewing on hard foods can also cause significant dental problems Dental experts gave tips on how to take better care of and preserve natural teeth By Eveline Gan By Eveline Gan Published May 18, 2024 Updated May 20, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — She loved drinking bubble tea and whenever she felt stressed at work, she often snacked on “healthy” granola bars and fruit snacks. Even though she told her dentist that she always chose reduced-sugar food items and that she was diligent about her oral hygiene routine, she was having several oral health problems at the age of 30. Dr James Ho, founder and chief executive officer of GPlus Dental Center and G Dental Center, said that despite the young officer worker was having cavities and gum inflammation, which made her swollen gums bleed easily whenever she brushed her teeth. The enamel surface of her teeth also showed signs of erosion, leading to tooth sensitivity. For many Singaporeans, snacking throughout the day is not just a casual indulgence; it is a way of life. However, the frequent consumption of sugar-laden treats and beverages has come at a cost to their oral health. Coupled with poor dental habits, it is no wonder that a significant proportion of adults here have to deal with oral health problems and retaining their natural teeth as they age. The latest National Adult Oral Health Survey in 2019 revealed that around a third (35 per cent) of Singaporeans aged 21 and above suffer from untreated dental caries. Additionally, a staggering 94 per cent of adults were found to have gum disease, which if left untreated, can progress to more severe conditions and even tooth loss. In 2020, the National Dental Centre Singapore (NDCS) launched the Oral Health Movement 8020, a pilot programme that encourages people aged 40 and above to maintain at least 20 of their natural teeth beyond the age of 80. Its pilot study involving 780 adults aged 40 and above found that around 17 per cent were in the orally pre-frail or had tipped into the orally frail state. This means that a decline in oral function affects their ability to chew, swallow and speak. A key factor contributing to oral frailty is the number of remaining teeth. Dr Chan Pei Yuan, the programme lead for the Oral Health Movement 8020, noted that the programme has brought attention to the low awareness and prioritisation of oral health among Singaporeans. Dr Chan also pointed out that the National Adult Oral Health Survey found that more than a third (34.4 per cent) of the adults surveyed visited the dentist only when they experienced a problem with their teeth, mouth or dentures. EXPENSIVE, INVASIVE DENTAL TREATMENTS FOR DAMAGED TEETH Regular cleaning and preventive care are key to keeping your teeth and gums healthy. Dr Lee Wan Zhen, head of the periodontics unit with the department of restorative dentistry at NDCS, said: “Those who neglect regular dental check-ups and fail to address cavities in their early stages are at risk of losing their natural teeth permanently.” Dr Ho cautioned: “Delaying dental care can worsen cavities, requiring invasive treatments like root canals or extractions, while untreated gum disease may lead to costly procedures such as preventable gum surgery or tooth loss. “Similarly, ignoring a cracked tooth can result in infections, necessitating expensive treatments like dental crowns or root canals.” The dental experts listed below some common habits that are bad for your teeth and gums, along with what you can do to save your teeth and improve your oral health. 1. TAKING MANY SMALL MEALS, SNACKING THROUGHOUT THE DAY Some people who are trying to lose weight believe that snacking or grazing on small meals throughout the day helps to boost metabolism rate. Not only is this not a proven claim, it is bad for your teeth because taking frequent small meals or snacks throughout the day does not give saliva enough time to neutralise acids in the mouth. However, being constantly on the move and juggling demanding work and personal schedules may mean that many younger adults tend to snack, rather than adhere to proper mealtimes, he said. “They also have a higher tendency to skip meals or have irregular meal patterns, since they eat when they feel is convenient to them. “Saliva production typically increases during meal times. Skipping meals or frequent snacking, especially when you snack outside of regular mealtimes, means there will be less saliva to help rinse away food particles and neutralise acids in the mouth, increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease,” he said. Dr Lee from NDCS explained that while eating or drinking, especially foods high in sugar or acids, the pH level in the mouth becomes more acidic, meaning the pH level becomes lower. When the pH levels fall below a certain critical level, the enamel that is the hard outer structure of teeth starts to dissolve. “Snacking throughout the day exposes teeth to a constant source of sugars that can be used by the oral bacteria to produce acids. “With frequent snacking, this acidic environment can persist for an extended period below the critical pH level (of 5.5), thereby providing ample time for acids to erode enamel and dentine (the middle layer of the tooth) and weaken teeth. “If snacking replaces meals or if snacks are low in water content, it can result in low salivary flow. Reduced saliva flow means less protection against acid attacks, increasing the risk of tooth decay,” Dr Lee added. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Have regular meals at fixed timings. This results in fewer acid attacks on the teeth, compared to continuous snacking, Dr Lee said. “Meals consumed at regular hours are followed by a period of time before the next meal, allowing time for saliva to neutralise acids and re-mineralise teeth between eating episodes,” she explained. Dr Ho said that continuous chewing — for at least 20 minutes — during regular mealtimes stimulates higher saliva flow. “Saliva contains essential minerals like calcium and phosphate, which help in the re-mineralisation process, repairing early signs of enamel erosion and decay.” Dr Lee advised having three balanced meals a day and if needed, to take oral health-friendly snacks in between (see point below). 2. TAKING TOO MUCH ACIDIC, SUGARY FOODS AND DRINKS Popular sugary snacks and drinks that are sticky and chewy such as kueh, glutinous rice balls, mochi and bubble tea with its add-on gelatinous items in the form of jelly and tapioca balls tend to adhere to teeth, filling crevices and spaces for extended periods of time, promoting bacterial growth. Even dishes such as fried carrot cake with sweet dark soya sauce, mee siam and mee rebus has high sugar content. A diet high in sugar, acidic foods and beverages can contribute to tooth decay and erosion. This can weaken the enamel surface of teeth, making teeth more susceptible to cracking and also lead to tooth loss over time. The types of food and drinks considered acidic are citrus fruit such as oranges, vinegar-based salad dressings and health products such as apple cider vinegar. iStock Excessive sugar intake weakens tooth enamel and fuels bacteria in the mouth that can cause cavities. Dr Lee said that people who engage in an active lifestyle or play sports regularly might consume isotonic energy drinks, which can be high in sugars and acids. People may also drink sweetened caffeinated beverages such as instant coffee or caffeinated energy drinks to stay awake, most of which contain sugars, she added. Besides weakening tooth enamel, excessive sugar intake fuels bacteria in the mouth that can cause cavities. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Pick nutritious snacks that are low in sugar and acids, while high in nutrients such as fibre, calcium and vitamins. Some examples are: Fruits and vegetables such as apples, carrots, pears, watermelon, celery and cucumber slices. These are low in sugar and acids. The fibres in fruit and vegetables also provide mechanical cleansing to remove dental plaque from smooth surfaces of teeth Unsweetened dairy products such as plain yoghurt or Greek yoghurt. They are rich in calcium and phosphorus, which strengthen tooth enamel Whole grain crackers and bread Hard-boiled eggs Plain popcorn Dark chocolate with a high cocoa content (70 per cent or more) and minimal added sugars Dr Ho also said that although the choice of snacks may be important, it is not just acidic or sugary foods and beverages that may solely and directly affect oral health. “In the aftermath of snacking, take care of food particles that can become lodged between teeth, which promote bacterial growth and increase the risk of dental issues. “Post-snacking oral hygiene practices can help to reduce potential oral health problems. Do what is practically possible, like swishing water in your mouth after meals. “To minimise direct contact between sweet drinks and teeth, consider using a straw, which can reduce the risk of enamel erosion and tooth decay. “To minimise plastic, there are eco-friendly stainless steel straws and bamboo straws alternatives,” he added. The dentists also suggested consuming sugary or acidic food and drinks as part of a meal — for example, at the end of the meal — rather than as snacks throughout the day or a standalone snack. The increased saliva production during meals would help neutralise the acids. “Try to avoid snacking right before bedtime because saliva production decreases during sleep, leaving teeth more vulnerable to acids. “If you must snack at night, opt for a small low-sugar snack, drink water and brush your teeth afterward,” Dr Lee advised. Dr Ho pointed out that some research suggested that brushing teeth immediately after consuming something acidic can damage the enamel, so it may be advisable to wait around 30 minutes before brushing. However, removing food that stick between teeth should be done right after meals, either by flossing or even using a toothpick, he said. 3. NOT DRINKING ENOUGH WATER If you do not drink enough plain water throughout the day, it can lead to a dry mouth, increasing the risk of cavities due to reduced salivary flow, Dr Lee said. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Staying adequately hydrated — with plain water — is essential for maintaining saliva production and good oral health. Rinsing the mouth with water after consuming sweet beverages and food can also reduce teeth’s exposure to sugars and acids. “It helps to dilute and to wash away some of the sugar and acid residues, which can lessen the risk of tooth decay and enamel erosion,” Dr Ho advised. 4. CRUNCHING ICE CUBES, USING TEETH AS TOOLS When munching on hard, crunchy food, it is advisable to exercise caution because that is a common cause of dental emergencies such as cracked teeth or lost fillings. “Hard, crunchy snacks can be detrimental to dental health as they can cause microscopic fractures in tooth enamel. In this hot weather, I also caution my patients against chewing on ice cubes,” Dr Ho said. Examples of hard food items that can cause such tiny fractures over time include nuts, potato chips or certain types of biscuits such as pretzel biscuits. That said, the extent of damage can vary, based on other factors such as dental health, enamel strength and some eating habits. For instance, teeth grinding, trauma from accidents or sports injury may weaken the tooth structure. Or habits such as cracking open chicken bone or crab shells using teeth can also cause stress fractures to accumulate on teeth, which may result in cracked or split teeth over time, Dr Lee said. For denture wearers, consuming hard, crunchy snacks can be problematic as well. “These snacks can exert excessive pressure on dentures, leading to discomfort, soreness or even damage to the dentures. “Also, hard food may cause dentures to become dislodged or loosen, increasing the risk of injury to the mouth or throat,” Dr Ho said. And on one other point, Dr Ho emphasised that “teeth are not tools”. Use the proper tools intended for opening packages and bottles or to crack hard nuts. “Once, a patient told me that whenever she could not rip a snack packaging apart, she would use her teeth instead. “I strongly advise not to use your teeth to open bottles, packages or perform other tasks because it can lead to chipping or other damage,” he said. WHAT YOU CAN DO : Dr Ho has the following tips for minimising the risk of cracked teeth while eating harder or crunchy food. Cut hard or crunchy foods into smaller, more manageable pieces. This reduces the force exerted on teeth If you have dental restorations such as fillings, crowns or veneers, be mindful and avoid biting into hard food items with excessive force. Consider choosing softer alternatives such as nut butters or sliced apples Consuming foods rich in calcium such as dairy products of milk, cheese and yoghurt may help strengthen tooth enamel and make teeth more resistant to cracks and fractures Dr Chan, a consultant at the department of restorative dentistry in NDCS, said that for people with teeth grinding or clenching habits, managing stress or using a mouthguard can help prevent cracked teeth and preserve natural teeth. Then, there are parafunctional habits such as clenching of teeth, frequently chewing on hard foods, which can cause problems. Wearing a mouthguard when playing sports or doing high-impact activities such as skateboarding is also helpful. Regular dental check-ups are essential to detect and treat any emerging problems, which can prevent dental problems from progressing and leading to tooth loss later in life, Dr Chan added. 5. RUSHING THROUGH OR NEGLECTING ORAL CARE ROUTINE Not brushing and flossing properly, or missing spots when cleaning allow plaque to build up on teeth and gums. Brushing and flossing are integral in preventing tooth decay because they remove the “food source” for the bacteria that causes tooth decay. If there is a thick biofilm of dental plaque, saliva cannot penetrate between teeth to help re-mineralise and reverse some of the acid damage on teeth, Dr Lee said. Urging young adults not to delay or neglect routine dental check-ups due to their busy schedules, Dr Ho said that this group of adults may have the perception that they are healthy and do not see the need to visit their dentist regularly. This is not true at all. Improving oral health requires a joint effort between home oral care and guidance provided by a dentist, he added. Besides detecting and treating issues early, a dentist can also give personalised instruction on how to brush and floss your teeth properly based on the person’s dental profile. WHAT YOU CAN DO: Dr Ho advised dedicating three to four minutes to oral care routine at least twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste. Incorporate flossing into your daily routine to clean between teeth and remove plaque from areas that your toothbrush may not reach. Selecting the right dental products matter, too. Use a toothpaste with fluoride to help neutralise harmful acid and strengthen the enamel. Dr Ho advised choosing a toothbrush with soft bristles and consider using an antiseptic or fluoride mouthwash as a form of supplementary oral care. Addressing the misconception that brushing harder or using a hard bristle brush removes more plaque, he said: “We sometimes hear dentists say, ‘Don't brush your teeth like you are scrubbing the kitchen floor’. “This is to emphasise to patients the need for gentle, circular motions rather than harsh scrubbing. “Using hard bristle brushes and brushing too vigorously can be harmful to oral health rather than beneficial.” Pexels Use gentle, circular motions when brushing teeth. Don't scrub them like the kitchen floor. Dr Ho also said that although some studies may suggest potential risks of long-term mouthwash use, such as cancer, the evidence is inconclusive. “Using mouthwash with fluoride regularly is beneficial after brushing and flossing. If you have just had oral surgery, and your dentist advises that you use mouthwash containing chlorohexidine, then you should do so. “Always consult your dentist and voice out any concerns that you may have. It is important to cultivate a trusting relationship with your dentist by having open communication,” he said. Schedule regular dental visits at least once a year, or as advised by your dentist. Dr Ho said that it is advisable to, where possible, try to stick with a regular dentist. “Dentist-hopping could perhaps lead to delay in detecting and treating dental issues and cause more permanent damage down the road.” Related topics Health teeth dentist Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-q3V7ihKhZic')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-NncoFmcvN7o')); Trending Content is loading...

Ms Adeline Tay, 28, regularly shares the ups and downs of living with auto-immune disease alopecia to her 40,000 followers on TikTok First going unexpectedly viral online with a video of a bird, she soon found herself fielding questions on her hair loss Her online series, \"All about Alopecia\", has documented her journey across multiple hair regrowths and relapses, which each take a mental toll Using humour and vulnerability on her platform as she shares everyday adult life, she hopes it helps others feel \"less alone'' By Nikki Yeo By Nikki Yeo Published May 18, 2024 Updated May 20, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — As I prepared to meet 28-year-old Adeline Tay for an interview on her TikTok fame and her journey as an “alopecian”, I found myself mulling over how to be delicate when approaching the subject of her hair loss. Yet, from the moment I walked into the room, any fear of awkward tension — from either of us — quickly evaporated thanks to her warm and bubbly demeanour. In hindsight, I shouldn't have been too surprised by this. After all, Ms Tay is also no stranger to being in front of a camera, as a creative strategist and host at digital publisher Our Grandfather Story and content creator on social media platform TikTok. As one of her more than 40,000 followers on TikTok, where she goes by the username “adelimey” and describes herself as “a botak (Malay for bald) in her trial-and-error era”, I have learnt more about alopecia totalis, the auto-immune condition which causes unpredictable hair loss. A former officer cadet in the Singapore Armed Forces, Ms Tay was first diagnosed in 2016. Her first bald spot appeared to be the size of a 20-cent coin-like patch at the back of her head before becoming larger. At one point, she lost around 95 per cent of her hair, including her eyebrows and eyelashes. One of her most popular TikTok videos showed her colleagues joining her to wear bucket hats as a show of support during an alopecia relapse. Other popular posts include one that showcased the different haircuts proposed by her barber, as well as those that debunk misperceptions about the condition. When I met her earlier this month (May 3), she was in her sixth regrowth, referring to a period when some hair grows back. She was sporting what looks like a pixie cut from the front, though she turned to reveal some patches of hair loss spread across the back of her head. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Ms Adeline Tay has shared her experience of suffering from the condition alopecia totalis, which results in hair loss. Despite describing herself as “pretty awkward” offline, as I sat across from Ms Tay for over an hour, my initial wariness of broaching supposedly sensitive subjects dissipated. What resonated with me, and undoubtedly does too with her online following, is the candour and cheerful courage she brings to navigating everyday life. Her platform started as a way to raise awareness on living with an auto-immune condition that lacks a permanent cure. It has now expanded to feature reflections on anything from mental health to documenting the simple joys of buying an inflatable frog keychain. Almost as if she was comforting me rather than being interviewed by me, much as she does online, she said: “I want to reach people who are trying their best everyday to figure out (how to live) life. \"I hope that if I promote it (alopecia) and normalise it, I get to reach out to people who are like me, and let them know it is fine. We all grow at our own pace.” A LIGHTER APPROACH TO ALOPECIA AWARENESS The start of her TikTok stardom was a happy accident, as her first viral video in October 2021 was the incessant morning call of an Asian koel bird in her neighbourhood. “I have never imagined myself being a content creator. I do make funny videos, but that is just for my friends, and I posted that video not knowing it would appear on other people’s 'for you' pages as well,” said Ms Tay. In her second video of the noisy bird, she accidentally included herself in the video, which drew comments from viewers who asked about her then thinning and mostly white hair. True to her aims to keep things light, she initially joked in reply that her hair loss was because she ate too much instant noodles or because of academic stress. She then made a segue to spread awareness about her auto-immune condition. Ms Tay now has a series of over 30 videos called “All about Alopecia”, where she has shared on how she copes with hair loss and has fielded questions such as: Are you a boy or a girl? Becoming a content creator is another one of life’s twists and turns for Ms Tay, and cracking jokes about her condition is something she could not have imagined years ago. “When I was first diagnosed, I was really depressed and hid away for a good while. I didn't even look in the mirror back then,” she said. She added that during that initial period she and her family had become more dejected as they explored various treatments to no avail. “I didn’t have eyebrows then, but I had a white board marker at home, so I tried drawing my eyebrows with a whiteboard marker. I found it pretty funny, and saw my parents laughing, and I thought: 'Why not? Just learn to find joy in it'.” 'UNASHAMED' OF BEING HERSELF Yet even as Ms Tay’s humour shone through, it did not take long before our conversation treaded into personal matters closer to her heart. Though she set up her platform to spread awareness about alopecia, Ms Tay said it has become like a journal for her, as her physical and mental health journey has been anything but linear. When I asked how she feels about her current stage of hair regrowth, she admitted that she was initially hesitant to talk about it out of fear of the next relapse. “Even to this day, I’m pretty afraid. You get paranoid when you wake up and you see hairs on your pillow or when you shower, there’s more hair than usual,” said Ms Tay. “When I go through a relapse, it’s not just myself, it’s the people around me who go through it emotionally too. I’m afraid of getting people’s hopes up and disappointing them again.” More than a cosmetic problem, she added that the emotional experience of having alopecia should not be discounted as people with the condition can feel helpless as they do not have agency over an important, highly visible part of their appearance. On her TikTok platform, she often shares her emotions in documenting her “growing pains” in the areas of work, relationships and health. “Dealing with mental health and the relapses of alopecia, there are good and bad days. Some days you will be so happy and another I might be crying in another TikTok video.\" She added that there is no formulaic approach to what she does, just a wish to \"document life\" as an adult doing her best. Ms Tay tells me that she makes edits before posting — such as trimming a recent emotional two-minute video on friendship breakups down from 40 minutes. Still, she said that her platform is one where she is “unashamed” to share the downsides of life, as she hopes it helps others feel “less alone”. It is this vulnerability that has connected her with others with similar struggles, many of whom have thanked her over direct messages for sharing her mental health journey and made their own confessions such as having difficulty getting up in the morning. She recalled realising the “very real” impact her videos had when a cancer patient tagged her in a video, stating that she had been inspired to shave her hair off because she had seen Ms Tay openly discussing her hair loss. On another occasion, during a period when Ms Tay had patchy hair, she encountered a mean comment from a group of secondary school students. One of the boys in the group had blurted out while she was within earshot: “What’s up with her hair?” She was stunned, but was then encouraged by the reaction of another boy, who turned out to be familiar with her content and chided his friend by stating that she was a TikTok creator and that her hair loss was because she was sick. “It showed me that people help. Sharing my story does help, because what if out there in a secondary school, there’s someone with alopecia?” said Ms Tay. As for any advice she might have to those who want to try being similarly open or vulnerable online, Ms Tay said: “With every (piece of) content, I think quite a bit before I post. You must make sure that you are comfortable, it shouldn’t be something that’s pressuring.” “A digital footprint is a very real thing, I’m pretty sure there’s a video of me putting tattoos on my head that will be there forever, when I’m 60 I’ll probably have to look at it,” she added with a laugh. “I’m comfortable, that’s why I share it. So don’t feel like you have to do it, because there’s a lot of different ways you can advocate for things, without putting your face in front of the camera.” Related topics The Stories Behind alopecia TikTok Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-9TD9LeOU0Ek')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-iIsZEFMsSV8')); Trending Content is loading...

It can be intimidating to get started when there is so much information out there and so many options to choose from. And so I decided to try out some of the most popular meditation and wellness apps out there to find out which may be best for different segments of the population. I measured the apps based their cost, features, intuitiveness and overall experience. After a week of meditating and hearing soothing voices asking me to close my eyes and focus on my breath, I’ve concluded that finding the right meditation app is a personal journey. Whether you prefer an evidence-based approach or more gentle, mindful ways to move, there is an app that understands and caters to your needs. HEADSPACE One of the most well-known apps on the market, Headspace caters to all levels, with introductory courses all the way to more advanced sessions for long-time meditators. The app offers various structured courses that require users to spend a maximum of 10 minutes a day, from learning the basics of meditation to more targeted courses dealing with issues such as work stress and anxiety. If courses are too much of a commitment, there are also emotion-based single sessions, such as a 10-minute guided meditation for when you are feeling frustrated or gearing up for a difficult conversation. Headspace also offers Sleepcasts, soothing audio to help users fall asleep, as well as animated videos that explain meditation techniques in an engaging way. The app's Mindful Workouts series combines physical exercises and dance with mindfulness practices. For example, their Mindful Cardio series makes running or jogging an intentional and mindful exercise. During the 10-minute run, the coach guides you to check in with your body and notice your surroundings. I enjoyed being especially present during the exercise and aware of both my mind and body working together. I left the short session feeling energised and my mind also felt more alert. My experience with Headspace was a breeze. The app's intuitive design and vast library of content made my meditation journey a delightful exploration. Cost: 14-day free trial, S$17.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription 10 PERCENT HAPPIER 10 Percent Happier is designed for people who may be skeptical of meditation and want to learn the science behind it, or those who prefer a more practical approach to the practice. The app offers videos that break down the psychology behind feelings such as stress, anxiety and phobias, and offer guided meditation sessions related to each video. These in-depth mindfulness and mental health courses are led by experienced meditation experts, including authors of mindfulness books and academics who teach mindfulness courses at universities. The app also has videos of interviews and talks with meditation experts for those who want to understand the nuts and bolts of the practice. Personally, I found 10 Percent Happier’s courses helpful in learning about meditation from those in the field. I like that there is a short and engaging video that preps you before each meditation session. Their single meditation session also covers a variety of topics taught by different experts, something I quite enjoyed. For single meditation sessions, users can choose the length of the session, which can be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 45 minutes. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$19.98 per month, S$138.98 annual subscription CALM Another well-known meditation app, Calm, features guided meditations focusing on stress management, anxiety, and sleep. Like Headspace, Calm offers content such as soundscapes, sleep stories and guided breathwork and meditation sessions. A defining feature of Calm is the Daily Calm session. Each day the app offers up a 10-minute meditation session that is weaved together with a story. The app has also started offering mindful stretching and light exercise guides called the Daily Move, nuggets of wisdom titled the Daily Jay, and a more fun meditation to start your day with the Daily Trip. A unique feature of Calm's Sleep Stories is that they are sometimes narrated by famous personalities. I found the Sleep Stories read by Harry Styles and Cillian Murphy especially soothing, while Lebron James's session on training your mind is a masterclass in focus and how to build mental strength. The strength of Calm is its collaboration with actors and singers to add a mindful slant to content you might be familiar with. For example, the app has an hour-long track by American singer-songwriter JVKE entitled \"This Is What Sleep Sounds Like\", a riff on his album track titles. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$78.98 annual subscription, S$599,98 one-time lifetime subscription DOWNDOG Down Dog is a fitness app that includes meditation and breathwork exercises. You can tailor your meditation sessions by choosing the length, focus and background sounds to suit your preferences. The app integrates seamlessly with Down Dog’s other fitness apps, which offer guided yoga, HIIT and barre exercises. A subscription to Down Dog gives you access to all of these apps. Down Dog is probably more well-suited to people who are already familiar with meditation and want to be able to jump into a session without any extra videos or frills to sit through. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$14.48 monthly subscription, S$88.98 yearly subscription INSIGHT TIMER Insight Timer is an app with an extensive library of guided sessions and a strong community approach. The app includes a customisable meditation timer with ambient sounds, structured courses and workshops, and a strong community aspect, allowing users to connect with others and join interest-based groups. Meditation should not have to cost an arm and a leg and Insight Timer is one of the few apps that offers a free version that allows users access to more than 146,000 guided meditations, talks, podcasts, and music tracks. The free version does not include access to the app's courses, offline listening, or the ability to rewind or fast-forward. I was impressed by the variety of guides available on the app —in addition to the usual courses on issues such as stress and anxiety, boundaries and productivity, the app even offers meditation courses on topics such as beauty and ageing. Insight Timer's seemingly endless library of guides can be overwhelming for those just starting out, but if you are looking to further your practice or uncover other parts of yourself, this would be a good app to dive into. Cost: Seven-day free trial, S$13.48 monthly subscription, S$81.98 yearly subscription As someone who tries to keep up with her meditation practice, this experiment in trying out various apps was a helpful to see what works for me. I was already subscribed to Calm for its accessible Daily Calm practice and Sleep Stories, but now I'm considering a subscription to 10 Percent Happier too. I feel that its evidence-based approach, complemented by informative documentary-style videos, not only enhances my practice but also deepens my understanding of meditation. That said, what is right for me may not be the best choice for everyone else. So I suggest you close your eyes, focus on your breath and start your own exploration of the world of meditation.

New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Four-year-old Atlas Wong is travelling the world with his parents for two years instead of attending preschool Before he was born, his parents had made a promise to each other to take their firstborn on worldly adventures To afford this journey, they saved money for five years, living frugally and prioritising experiences over material possessions Since they started travelling on Jan 17, the family has visited more than 20 countries They plan to continue travelling to more destinations until Atlas turns six , believing that this is a valuable educational experience for him By Amanda Yeap By Amanda Yeap Published May 25, 2024 Updated May 29, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Instead of attending preschool like other children his age , four-year-old Atlas Wong, who was named after his parents' passion for travel , is doing his learning while flying across the globe. Over the last four months, he has travelled to 22 countries including Belgium, France, Greece and Turkiye. His jet-setting life will continue until he is six, with destinations such as Canada, Japan and the United States still to come. His parents, civil servants Rakcent Wong, 35, and Carol Tan, 36, came up with the 50-country list after they promised each other that they would take their child on \"worldly adventures\" before he started formal school. Mr Wong, who like his wife is on a two-year sabbatical from his job, said: \"Atlas means a bundle of maps. Since we already planned to travel around the world, we thought this would be an appropriate name (for him).\" Before Atlas was born, Mr Wong and his wife frequently embarked on short trips overseas. With every trip, the couple said that they learned more about themselves and the cultures in the places they visited. He added: “Travelling has such a strong transformative power, and we want to gift it to our child despite people telling us that we should stop travelling after having a kid.” When I first heard about their two-year sojourn after chancing upon their joint Instagram account Engaging Atlas, I was in awe. The idea of taking time off from work and life to travel seemed so out of reach for an average working adult. Yet here they were, somehow managing to \"live the dream\" with their young son, determined to show him places I might not get to visit in my lifetime. Apart from myself, more than 11,500 followers eagerly tune in to get a glimpse of their adventures through the account, meticulously curated by Atlas' parents. Every day, the couple sets out with their phone camera, capturing various sights, sounds and experiences. Each video is marked with a country flag and the day of their travel so that viewers may easily track when and where the family has been. That was why when I arranged to meet them online on a FaceTime video-call, I had a question that I was dying to ask: How in the world are they able to do all this? To my question, Ms Tan said that their two-year trip is being funded from their savings, which they accumulated from living frugally for five years from the time before Atlas was born. “We set this five-year target because we thought Atlas should be more independent by then. “He should be able to eat on his own and walk a bit further, and when we come back, it would be just in time for primary school. So we felt this was the right time,” Mr Wong said. The family was in Cyprus at the time when we spoke. This week, they are in Nepal. After doing their sums, the couple calculated that the trip would cost them an average of S$150 a day, inclusive of the cost of flight tickets. Mr Wong admitted that it was tough at the start because he had to really scrutinise his wife’s finances. “She appreciates the finer things in life,” he said with a laugh. Ms Tan said that before they made this decision to travel for an extended period of time, she led a more indulgent lifestyle and had no qualms about splurging on cafe food and branded bags every now and then. “After that, I realised I wasn’t truly happy even when I spent on these items. Travelling, however, gave me a different perspective on life. So I changed my mindset to focus on valuable experiences instead of materials, and I managed to save up for our financial goal of travelling,” she added. The couple do not own a car and have been living in a four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat since 2016, before Atlas was born. They mostly ate cheap hawker food and relied on public transport to get around, and made it a point to take the cheapest flights available over the course of their two-year journey. Even with such decisions, it was a trade-off that was unpalatable to some, the couple told me. “Our parents were very supportive because they knew how free-spirited and adventurous we are. But our friends, especially our colleagues, told us we should stop our adventures now that we have a kid,\" Ms Tan said. These comments did not deter the couple but spurred them instead to push ahead with their plans, even if it meant forgoing income and the ability for Atlas' grandparents to see him in person for two years. Rakcent Wong, Carol Tan Mr Rakcent Wong, his wife Carol Tan and their son Atlas Wong in Albania in January 2024. THE TRIP BEGINS Their journey started on Jan 17 when they left Singapore for Greece. The couple decided that this would be their first location for practical reasons — they managed to snag cheap flight tickets for about S$300 a person. There, they visited the black sand beach in the island of Santorini, where the sand is made of volcanic material and lava fragments, and witnessed the sunset at the picturesque village of Oia. Since then, they have visited more than 20 places in Europe, including Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. These were places that I had only read about or seen on television, but never in real life. Truth be told, I was more amazed than envious, because it wasn't that I couldn't afford to travel to these dreamy locales, but it was just an unimaginable thought that I would have to set aside my commitments to be abroad. Also, for a start, travelling to all these places with a young child in tow sounded tiring. However, as Mr Wong and Ms Tan regaled me with tales of their epic travels, it was hard to tell that they were suffering from any travel fatigue. Right before our FaceTime session at 1pm Singapore time, the pair told me that they had not slept in 24 hours. The couple had just reached Cyprus — it was 8am over there — after braving a red-eye (overnight) flight from Turkiye the night before. Yet, to my eyes, I could hardly detect any homesickness or exhaustion, as the couple excitedly shared how their next steps would take them to Nepal, where they plan to stay for a month to maximise their travel visa validity period there. As to exactly where they will be, Mr Wong said that they have no concrete itinerary or plan in place, except that they have to be in Kenya by July because that is the best time for a safari visit. At this point, I thought about how the longest I've been away from home for travels was two weeks. I cannot fathom ever needing to extend a trip just so I could get the most out of my travel visa. After all, I am not someone who can live without Asian cuisine for more than two days. Mr Wong and Ms Tan said that coping with the lack of Singapore food was one of the hardest moments they had to experience during their global adventure. Two weeks after departing Singapore, Atlas asked for char siew (barbecued pork) rice. “Char siew rice was his comfort food because we would have it once every three to four days. It was so easy to 'dabao' (Chinese for take-away) when the stall was just downstairs,\" Ms Tan said, recalling that this happened while they were in North Macedonia. “I felt so bad because I couldn’t find char siew rice for him. His diet was my biggest concern.” Refusing to be defeated by this, she then sought to level up her cooking skills in order to whip up Singapore meals for Atlas and her husband whenever they wanted a taste of home. Rakcent Wong, Carol Tan Mr Rakcent Wong, his wife Carol Tan and their son Atlas Wong in Krka National Park, Croatia in February 2024. BEING GOOD PARENTS To the couple, the most challenging part of their journey was not related to finances, pausing their careers or navigating new places. Rather, it was having to be a good parent to Atlas while coping with travel anxieties. \"Parenting is always a challenge,\" Mr Wong said. \"Balancing it with travel and other responsibilities adds an extra layer of difficulty, especially when we're on our own out here.\" He and his wife admitted that the journey so far has not been all butterflies and rainbows. \"But we embraced the journey as a family, knowing it would be the most rewarding part,\" Mr Wong added. At the end of the day, the trip is not meant for the couple to indulge themselves, they said. It was conceived from the start to give Atlas an enriching adventure. To this, Mr Wong recalled how, in Lyon, France, their son saw the exposed mechanism of a cable car and decided to pepper his parents with questions about it. Far from being put off, Mr Wong said that hearing the boy's questions put to rest any doubts that they had when they first decided to embark on their journey. “Atlas stood there and watched cable cars go up and down for a good 10 minutes. He asked specific questions like, ‘How does this work? Why is it like this?’ “We thought this would be a good skill that he could use further in life because when you learn things, you need to know the reasons why. And when you’re curious, that’s when your knowledge will expand,” Ms Tan said. Asked if she was worried about how Atlas may fit into Singapore's primary school system when he reaches six, Ms Tan admitted that her son might not be \"used to sitting down\". “But with this sense of wonder he has shown throughout the trip, I’m sure he will become an effective learner when he’s older,” she said. I wish I could've seen Atlas on camera, but he was sound asleep at their lodging in Cyprus given that their red-eye flight was just hours before. I couldn't help thinking how it was so good that he has parents who believed that life lessons are best learned through exploration and exposure, and who were willing to pause their own lives to grant him a memorable childhood. It should go without saying that such a sojourn may not be for everyone, but a little part of me wonders if I would have had a different worldview had I gone on such a trip at Atlas' age. As the famed American zoologist Jack Hanna once said: \"The world is the true classroom. The most rewarding and important type of learning is through experience, seeing something with our own eyes.\" Related topics The Stories Behind parenting travel Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-LEiv5ZQ9o0c')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-97q5gsG29ks')); Trending Content is loading...

Mr Benedict Leong, 30, has been trying for years to lose the fat around his chest After a visit to the doctor, he found out that it was due to gynaecomastia, a medical condition causing male breast tissue enlargement Doctors interviewed said that they see a rise in men seeking treatment for gynaecomastia However, stigma and lack of awareness are barriers to treatment, which is straightforward The hardest step for men is getting themselves to the consulting room By Nicole Lam By Nicole Lam Published May 26, 2024 Updated June 11, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Despite years of trying to lose weight, Mr Benedict Leong struggled to shed the excess fat around his chest and could not understand why. The 30-year-old who runs a pet service business has been dedicating himself to intermittent fasting and various exercises, seeing improvements elsewhere in his body, but the weight around his chest stubbornly remained and even seemed more prominent. “My entire life, I’ve been told, ‘You’re a bit heavy' or 'You’ve gained weight'. So I thought anything that looks fat means that it’s just a weight-related problem.” Feeling like he had hit a wall, he decided to visit the doctor, where he was diagnosed with gynaecomastia or enlargement of the male breast tissue. Colloquially, this is sometimes called \"man boobs\" or just \"moobs\", though these are not terms that medical professionals tend to use. The impact of the condition is mainly psychological, though it can also cause discomfort for some. For Mr Leong, it was both a surprise and a relief to know that it was a medical condition and had nothing to do with weight. Moreover, it can be easily treated with day surgery with very little downtime. “I realised that it’s not my fault. It wasn’t that I was not doing enough,” he added. “I didn’t realise it is a condition that can be rectified.” “I decided to go and do it (the surgery) and ever since then, I’ve been feeling great.” He went for surgery in February. For Mr Leong, it was both a surprise and a relief to know that it was a medical condition and had nothing to do with weight. Mr Leong is not alone when it comes to gynaecomastia. Doctors contacted by TODAY said that they have been seeing an increase in men, especially those in their 20s to 30s, visiting their clinics to seek treatment for the condition. There are no official statistics for the number of men being treated here, but one doctor said that based on international studies, on average, 60 per cent of men worldwide exhibit gynaecomastia to some degree. Dr Ivan Puah, medical director of Amaris B Clinic, added: “The prevalence of asymptomatic gynaecomastia is 50 per cent to 60 per cent in adolescents and up to 70 per cent in men who are 50 to 69 years old.” Asymptomatic gynaecomastia refers to cases of gynaecomastia that occur in men with no identifiable cause. Dr Samuel Ho from Allure Plastic Surgery said that although there seems to be an increase in men going for gynaecomastia treatment, this does not necessarily indicate a prevalence of the condition in Singapore but rather a greater incidence of it. “(The number of cases) probably has increased over the years because of awareness,” he added. Dr Ho noted that he has seen more cases in the last five years. Allure Plastic Surgery Dr Samuel Ho from Allure Plastic Surgery. Indeed, on the online forum Reddit, there are several threads from online users in Singapore discussing their experience and sharing information about gynaecomastia. Users on the thread shared insights into which clinic they prefer, the cost of surgery and share post-operative experiences. Dr Puah said that even with online discussion, there is a stigma that stops men from seeking treatment. “Men may be hesitant to seek medical help or discuss their concerns due to fear of judgment or embarrassment.” Dr Ho said: “Just because you’re aware doesn’t mean you would want to get treated because sometimes, they may not know that there are treatment options.” As common and benign as gynaecomastia is, it is still a widely misunderstood condition. TODAY asked the doctors and patients to shed some much-needed light on the topic. WHAT IS GYNAECOMASTIA? Broadly, there are two causes of gynaecomastia: Physiological and pathological. Dr Samuel Ho from Allure Plastic Surgery said that physiological gynaecomastia is usually caused by a shift in hormones that occurs during two stages in a man’s life. “So it is periods of a lot of hormonal shifts. That's the age groups when they are post-pubertal (in their youth) and when they are post-andropausal in their 50s and 60s.” Dr Ho also said that it is extremely common for boys going through puberty to develop gynaecomastia, where up to 70 to 80 per cent experience it. However, there is a chance that it can resolve by itself and surgery might not be needed. Andropause, often referred to as male menopause, is a phase in a man's life typically associated with a gradual decline in testosterone levels, usually in middle-aged and older men. As for pathological gynaecomastia, it is usually caused by medication, illness or the use of anabolic steroids. Doctors told TODAY that some medications can have side effects that cause gynaecomastia, including antidepressants and calcium channel blockers. Dr Ivan Puah from Amaris B Clinic said there is a myth that gynaecomastia affects only overweight or obese individuals, and it is not true. “Gynaecomastia can occur in individuals of any body weight,” he added. “While excess fat can contribute to the appearance of enlarged breasts, hormonal imbalances and other factors can also cause gynaecomastia in individuals who are not overweight.” Collapse to view Expand to view THE SURGERY AND COST Doctors who spoke to TODAY said that the treatment for gynaecomastia is quite straightforward and can be done in an hour or two. A patient undergoing this surgery typically goes through the usual processes of physical examinations, blood tests and ultrasound tests to determine and confirm the diagnosis. Gynaecomastia is classified into four grades, with the first grade being the less noticeable to the fourth grade being the most pronounced and breast-like. Most often, the surgery involves a small incision of 2cm around the areola (area around the nipple) to remove the breast disc and some fat. The technique varies from plastic surgeon to plastic surgeon and is also dependent on the patient’s condition. Dr Tan Chuan Chien, consultant general surgeon of breast and thyroid surgery at SOG Health, said that medical advancement, minimally invasive surgical techniques and improved medical therapies are some of the emerging trends in gynaecomastia treatment. “These advancements offer better surgical outcomes and quicker recovery times for patients.” Dr Ho said that some patients can go back to work the next day if they want to, and most patients can return to physical exercise after a week. Mr Leong said of his experience: “I think the first few days, there was just a bit of discomfort because it’s a wound. “We do have to wear the compression garment, which took a while to get used to, but I think after about a week, I was fine.” Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Dr Ivan Puah (pictured) said that men may be hesitant to seek medical help for gynaecomastia or discuss their concerns due to fear of judgment or embarrassment. The cost of surgery varies depending on the clinic, but it can cost anywhere from S$15,000 to S$20,000. However, because it is a medical condition, it is fully covered by the Central Provident Fund's MediSave or by an insurance provider. For Mr Leong, his surgery cost S$15,000 and was completely covered by his insurance. “That was something that was pleasantly surprising,” he said. “I didn't know that this can be covered under insurance as a legitimate medical condition.” Dr Ho said: “The guys that go through it will discover that the whole process is quite simple. \"It is the ‘before’ of getting to the consulting room that really hampers them.” DEALING WITH BODY IMAGE Even though gynaecomastia is a physical condition, its psychological effects are more than skin-deep, and an hour’s surgery can make a world of difference. For Mr Leong, who had always been insecure about how his chest looked, he was more than thrilled to wake up to a flatter chest. “Immediately after the surgery, when I looked at myself, I said, 'Wow, that is a major change’ because I’ve always seen myself with protruding chest.” Benedict Leong Mr Benedict Leong pictured in December 2020, before seeking treatment for gynaecomastia. There is a level of “social embarrassment” for men when their chest does not conform to a certain ideal. Mr Leong added: “For men, there has always been a major focus on the upper body, on the chest and the abs. That’s generally the first thing when we try to draw the ‘perfect’ physique for a male.” This was compounded by the subliminal messages that Mr Leong received during his schooling days, where the guys in sports co-curricular activities were “favoured” by people in general. He himself was in drama club as the “artsy fartsy kid”. “Everybody was perpetuating a particular kind of ‘look’, especially with certain celebrities that look a certain way, and everybody would fawn over them... So I think subconsciously, all these bits and pieces start formulating an idea of what a man should look like.” In the Reddit post about gynaecomastia surgery, a user named “Queasy-Wear-1” said that he was “depressed” because of his gynaecomastia. He commented: “Every shirt you wear can see those puffy sharp nipples, which is very awkward so I end up slouching hard so it was not obvious. I can’t go swimming with friends, I can’t go shirtless. So there are a lot of (things) I can’t (do) there was no confidence at all.” Singapore, like many other societies, has certain body image ideals for men, Dr Puah said. “The emphasis on a lean and muscular physique often leads to increased concern or dissatisfaction among men with gynaecomastia.” Still, the condition is extremely common and treatable, Dr Tan said. The majority of those who undergo the surgery, like Mr Leong, are very happy with the results. “When I look at myself in the mirror, I feel great,” Mr Leong said, “and I know that it won’t come back.” “I can continue to work on other things that I want to work on in my life. It’s not just an emotional relief but also a mental release for myself.” Related topics body image plastic surgery Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-0xK4sXkfpUc')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-dkWy0Jzn4Qc')); Trending Content is loading...

Only one person can read it at a time,” he said. The lecturer in design communication at Lasalle College of the Arts has collected zines focused on skateboarding and photography for more than a decade. Zines, or fanzines, refer to independently published magazines that are often non-commercial and homemade or self-published in small circulation numbers. Today, Mr Wee’s collection runs from zines he has sourced both here and overseas to ones he has self-published, and even zines created by his students. The zines are largely centred on his hobbies of skateboarding and photography, though he also owns zines that cover topics such as living in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic and dealing with grief and regret over the loss of a loved one. Passion for printed magazines and its subset of zines — shared by readers and collectors such as Mr Wee — has been brought to the forefront in recent weeks. When Holland Village icon and landmark Thambi Magazine Store shuttered on May 5 after more than 80 years in business, there was a public outpouring of sadness and empathy, with many questioning what the future of print magazines would be. Publishers and collectors in Singapore, however, told TODAY that they believe it is unlikely that demand for zines and printed magazines would be completely stamped out anytime soon. While he described Thambi’s closure as “bittersweet”, Mr Wee said: “I’m not really afraid of the printed matter dying out, because there will always be people who want to keep it, or who desire that connection and intimacy — that physical interaction of handing someone a zine that they bought from you or you buying a zine from someone.” Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY A copy of a zine from Mr Timothy Wee's collection.

Project manager Sasitharan Alphonse, 43, has bought and subscribed to various print magazines for several years, including The New Yorker, Literary Review, The Atlantic and Time magazines. For the last two to three years, he has subscribed to physical copies of international film magazine Sight and Sound despite it being more expensive than an online subscription of the same. He picks up his monthly subscription in-person from the Basheer Graphics bookstore at Bras Basah Complex, because it also gives him the opportunity to browse other magazines on display. “For me, it gives some sort of emotional attachment when you hold the magazines in your hand,” Mr Alphonse said, adding that he prefers to collect and physically display magazines where it is content that he especially enjoys. This has led him to continue buying printed magazines in spite of the space constraints he has at home. Mr Alphonse said that the issue of what to do next with his growing collection is something he constantly faces, but he ultimately does not see himself moving away from printed magazines anytime soon. “I still prefer to have it in hand. Anytime I want to, I can go back and see it for reference.” Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Magazine collector Sasitharan Alphonse at his home on May 24, 2024.

Writer and translator Alicia Tan, who created zines between 2014 and 2018 as part of the creative duo Supponstar, said: “Printed magazines and zines really engage all your senses. “The thickness and texture of the paper used, the smell of ink, the vibrancy of the colours, the sound the paper makes when you flip a page — all matter.” A 38-year-old tutor who wanted to be known only as Madam Diana said: “I cannot read digital articles for long. “If it’s a very short article on Instagram — say two paragraphs — I’m still able to read it online. But once the content gets pretty heavy, I need to hold it in my hand.” Agreeing, 21-year-old university student Charles Toh said: “Even just tiny things like feeling yourself turn a page, set a book down, or put it aside, these are what occupies a definitive sense of physical space. “As things get more digitalised and virtual, these ground us in our own reality and make us feel human.” Members of the community said that a key appeal of printed magazines and zines is also how they connect people, often those who share a mutual love for the same subculture. “When you are the person selling the zine, you know who is receiving it,” Mr Wee said. “Most of my zines are collected through fairs, so when I buy it from a fair, I’m seeing the person who created it and I’m talking to them and connecting with them on that level as well.” Mr Pann Lim, 51, whose family of four has collectively created the Rubbish Famzines series since 2013, said that they also try to take part in the Singapore Art Book Fair every year. The co-founder and creative director of design and advertising agency Kinetic Singapore added: “We have even seen some of our readers grow from singles to now becoming married, and some of them even have kids. “We know that we are just doing (the zines) for us, but other than us, there are also people who are looking forward to the next issue. And I think that’s a really good reason for us to keep making them.” Raj Nadarajan/TODAY From left: Mr Pann Lim with his daughter Aira, son Renn, and wife Claire. The family is holding up different versions of the Rubbish Famzines that they have created over the years. KEEPING PRINT ALIVE WITH ZINES Mr Abdul Nasser, the owner of Basheer Graphics bookstore, said that the shop’s sales of printed magazines have fallen over the years, but there continues to be a steady demand for independently published zines. Such a trend is inevitable, especially since some of the more commercialised printed magazines have gone online and ceased their print run, he noted. Many zines, however, are handmade or self-produced and often only available as physical copies. They are also limited in quantities, and so are sought after as collectibles, he added. Agreeing, Ms Tan said that Supponstar had seen interest and sales for zines rise in recent years, compared to when it first started out in 2014. “We didn’t sell many copies in the 2014 Tokyo Art Book Fair, aside from our bilingual The Underwear Zine, but we saw a significant rise in sales when we took up a booth at the 2018 Singapore Art Book Fair.” The duo is currently on hiatus, though Ms Tan said that they are in talks about possibly restarting their zine-making. “There’s definitely a market and demand for zines with either a unique point of view or construction. But consumers are a lot more discerning because honestly, there’s a glut of media right now,” she added. Regardless, Mr Nasser believes that there will always be a demand for the medium of printed magazines and zines, even if it is just within a niche community. Likening it to some consumers’ love for vinyl records alongside the growth of online music streaming platforms, Mr Nasser said that there will always be people who will continue to buy printed magazines and zines purely because they value it.

Today, there is still a growing crowd of zine creators in Singapore who are keeping the tradition alive. One of them is Singaporean poet and editor Tse Hao Guang, 36, who turned to the medium to rally support for emerging writers’ works. Mr Tse is working with a team of other writers and designers to produce three upcoming literary zines — a “pamphlet series” titled Paper Jam — that will be launched on June 8. He said that the zine would mainly feature different works in poetry, flash fiction and short fiction. The team will kick off their maiden zine in June with a 100-copy print run for each of the three pamphlets. After that, they intend to release new issues of the literary zine yearly. While it is still early days for the team, Mr Tse said that the zine’s pre-order figures are “healthy”. “As long as there are good ideas and people working in print, I think zines and other printed matter will continue to flourish,” he added. Agreeing, Mr Lim of Rubbish Famzines said: “Everything can go digital, of course, but we cannot forget the experience of having a physical zine or magazine in front of you — flipping the book, the smell, and everything.” “It’s just like if you get a food delivery rider to send a cup of latte to you, versus you being at a cafe where you like the ambience, the interior design, and you are having a chat with your friend… The experience will never be the same.” With print matter getting scarcer today, Mr Lim who is trained as a print designer desires to keep the tradition alive. “I think print will still be around, because there are many people who love it. But personally, I feel the craft of print will get more scarce. “So for me, being a person in this industry for close to 25 years doing print, all the more I want to keep it alive… and to also share it with the young.” Related topics zines magazine Thambi Magazine Store Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity--cmITPi5Rzw')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-0XlMQ7tPWj8')); Trending Content is loading...

New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Dr Samuel Choudhury, a general practitioner, uses TikTok to share about medicine and health, with a focus on skincare and eye health with his 400,000 followers After a video he made about the Covid-19 Omicron variant went viral, he stepped up his use of the platform, with his most popular video to date racking up a whopping 16.5 million views His interest in skincare was sparked by his own acne and sensitive skin, which motivated him to share skincare tips and products with those who may face the same issues Dr Sam shares that his social media journey also helped him to gain confidence and become more comfortable in his skin By Shynn Ong By Shynn Ong Published May 26, 2024 Updated May 27, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — General practitioner (GP) Samuel Choudhury has amassed a vast 400,000 followers on TikTok through his account \"skingapore\", but what is curious about them is that most of his videos feature only the left half of his face. Dr Sam — as he prefers to be known — is now a natural in front of the camera as he shares content on medical matters and health, but he told TODAY how his acne scars had initially made him insecure about how he looked. The scars, which are barely visible to the casual observer, are from an aesthetic treatment that left complications on the right side of his face, which is why he prefers to show mainly the left half of his face in his videos. “I suffered since (my time in the) army because of camo(uflage) that gave me very bad acne. And then throughout medical school, acne also caused a lot of confidence issues,” he said. He went through bouts of acne treatment to treat the condition, which thankfully did not return, he added. After that, he underwent an aesthetic procedure to try to get rid of a scar on the right side of his face but the treatment caused more complications. “The complications from the procedure happened when I first started my TikTok journey and it affected my confidence a bit because I had to be on camera,\" he said. Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Dr Samuel Choudhury looking at his laptop at his home on May 14, 2024. Over time, though, exposure on the video-sharing platform gradually helped to boost his confidence and made him more comfortable in his own skin. “It was only one year after I started TikTok that I didn’t use filters on my videos because I just felt like it was not worth the hassle. So after a while, I started to accept that and move on.\" CONTENT INSPIRED BY HIS EXPERIENCE AS A GP The educational videos that Dr Sam shares deal with a range of medical and health matters, with a focus perhaps unsurprisingly on skincare, as well as eye health. Some content such as his “New Fear Unlocked” series — where he outlines instructive medical cases so that his followers can avoid committing the same medical mistakes — has racked up more than a million views. His most popular video to date, about a teenager in the United States who contracted hookworms after burying himself in sand on a Florida beach, has a whopping 16.5 million views. In his day job as a GP in family medicine, Dr Sam deals with patients grappling with illnesses ranging from menstrual cramps and diarrhoea to chronic conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Working on the medical frontline gives him some ideas on the content he puts out on TikTok. “Usually I would drive in silence and I would think to myself, ‘Okay, what happened today in the clinic that was interesting? What did patients ask me, or what were they shocked by?’ \"If somebody questioned me about (something), then it means probably a lot of people have the same concerns, then I would do a video about it,” he said. “Being a GP gives me the opportunity to talk about everything, because you need to know everything. Breadth of (knowledge on) medicine is very important as a GP.” Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Dr Samuel Choudhury filming himself on his phone at his home on May 14, 2024. To create a video, Dr Sam said that he can spend six to eight hours solely on research to ensure that the information he puts out is factual and accurate. Filming the video takes up to 45 minutes, while the final editing takes up two hours. “Most of the effort comes from preparation to ensure that the content is accurate. There were times when I would do a story and realise that, ‘Oh, this article is a hoax’ and I had to scrap it.” BEFRIENDING A HATER AND HELPING OTHERS In his journey as a content creator, Dr Sam has had his share of interesting encounters with his followers, including his haters. Talking about how he would look through the comments on all his videos for feedback, Dr Sam recounted the case of one user who would \"post a long reply every time (I) posted about skincare\". \"I could tell that he knew what he was saying and he probably works in the industry.\" Dr Sam said that he later attended an event and introduced himself to a makeup artist who was promoting a skincare line, who then told Dr Sam that he was the user who had been leaving those comments on his videos. “After that, we went out for coffee, then we talked about it, and now we’re friends,” Dr Sam said, adding that his hater-turned-friend would also take him to beauty product store Sephora to pick out makeup products. When he receives messages from his followers thanking him, Dr Sam said that he feels a sense of fulfilment, citing the example of a video he made about the dangers of feeding honey to infants aged under a year old. A grandmother sent him a message thanking him for the video, saying that she was not aware of this and would forward the video to her family to ensure that the boy did not eat honey. Dr Sam said: “All these messages and comments would make me feel like it was the right decision to make these videos and I’ll be motivated to find more interesting things to make content. “When I see the content that I put out is having an impact on the lives of people around the world, it is very fulfilling and meaningful because this is the definition of public health, whereby I can have an impact on the lives of people beyond my clinic. This is the wonderful invention of social media.\" Related topics skincare doctor GP TikTok Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-VjGilSKYiek')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-sbjHiaPuO1w')); Trending Content is loading...

Then in an effort to make my day more productive, I start rearranging my room or doing other things, except what I had set out to do. Then surprise! The panic over the deadline sets in and I get a boost of productivity at night. Suddenly, my work is completed, and I finally go to sleep at 7am. There lies the problem: In rushing to meet my deadline, I have sacrificed sleep, proper meals and even a daily shower. The accumulation of insufficient sleep and poor nutrition often led to me crashing after each deadline. It also left me feeling too tired to socialise and I end up losing precious time with family and friends. I know precisely the problem: I procrastinate too much. So how should I regain my balance and manage this better? WHY PEOPLE PROCRASTINATE Mental health experts I consulted said that there are broadly four reasons people procrastinate: Boredom, low self-confidence, a lack of competence and stress. Finding a task boring, or being overwhelmed by the complexity of the task, can cause one to stall for time. Not having the skills to tackle the assignment or feeling the pressure to finish it can also lead to procrastination. Then there are other things that people deem as important, but which can be a source of distraction. Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters psychological consultancy firm, said: “Tidying up your room or checking your emails are important. Socialising and having a nap can contribute positively to your mental health. “These may not seem like procrastination, but any task can (cause procrastination) when it is one that we use to distract ourselves from our task or goal.” WHAT MAKES PROCRASTINATION BAD? Experts said that it is normal to procrastinate, that it is okay to take breaks while on a task. Ms Amelia Mak from Heartscape Psychology clinic said: “Our limited attention span makes focusing on a task for long periods of time challenging.” Procrastination can even enhance productivity when the deadline draws nearer or when there is heightened concentration, Dr Yang said. However, it becomes an obstacle when excessive procrastination leads to missed deadlines or must-do assignments remain incomplete. At its most extreme, people start to “deny things are important to them” such as school or work, Dr Yang added. Procrastination becomes more than just being unproductive when it harms one’s well-being or their relationships with others. Negative effects can also come in the form of insufficient sleep, heightened stress and anxiety as deadlines approach and no progress has been made. HOW TO DEAL WITH IT The key in regulating procrastination is self-awareness, the experts said. Understanding “how” and “why” one is procrastinating can help with managing the emotions that come with a task. “It is important to set aside periodic breaks from tasks so it is intentional and not merely to procrastinate,” Dr Yang said. Ms Mak advised: “Be reflective on your own procrastination habits and understand these triggers or any patterns to specific tasks.” This means that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to procrastination, but it should instead be adapted to individual preferences and habits. I have tried several ways to deal with my habit of procrastinating: Using the timer application Pomodoro, turning to Study-With-Me videos and putting my phone aside. In the end, I had found them ineffective after a while and, after speaking with the experts, I now know why. So, I decided to give the three methods another try, timing how long it took me to write a 500-word article with each of these methods. Only this time, I tailored them to my individual routines. 1. POMODORO Pomodoro is a timer app that breaks up work into intervals of 25 minutes followed by a short break. It helps arrange time to provide intentional breaks for people to refresh themselves between study sessions. Ms Mak advised that the time intervals should be fitted within the individual’s threshold of attention. So I tried a 35-minute focused session with a five-minute rest, which suits me as I reached the break just as my focus was running out. I was able to finish my task in two hours and 23 minutes. However, having my phone beside me as a timer made it difficult to resist using my phone. As time dragged on, my attention span waned and the 35 minutes started to feel too long. 2. STUDY-WITH-ME VIDEOS Study-With-Me videos are made by creators who film themselves studying while inviting others to join them. Having environmental cues can help in facilitating focus and create a sense of belonging with the shared struggle of having to get work done. Using this method, I completed the task in the shortest time: One hour and 18 minutes. Watching live comments of how others were also struggling with their work helped reduce the stress that I felt from doing the task. Being able to interact with others in the comments also helped me deal with boredom. The only downside was the occasional advertisement that popped up. 3. PUTTING PHONE AWAY Phones can be a major distraction so I tried putting it out of my reach until I completed the task. This was more effective than Pomodoro and it took me one hour and 29 minutes to finish the task. I was able to resist the impulse to check my phone whenever I felt stressed and took a walk around my house when I was tired. However, this method is not always feasible for me since there are times where I need my phone for work. THE CONCLUSION While I found the most success with the Study-With-Me videos, experts said that one can try out different methods and adjust them accordingly. “Most importantly, allow for self-compassion and acknowledge that setbacks may occur in trying to kick the habit of procrastination,” Ms Mak said. Although these solutions don’t guarantee that I will always be productive, it has reduced the amount of time I spend on a task and allowed me to reconnect with my family and friends.

A 34-year-old Singaporean man who had been obese since childhood lost weight through surgery After that, he still had to live with a lot of loose skin folds He then went for body contouring surgery to remove the excess skin It was not just for aesthetic benefits because there were also medical reasons Doctors said such excess skin can interfere with daily activities, affect self-esteem and cause problems with hygiene By Eveline Gan By Eveline Gan Published June 1, 2024 Updated June 3, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — When Mr Bernard Sim shed a third of his 160kg frame within a year after bariatric surgery, he was thrilled and for the first time, experienced what it was like to be able to move “quickly” when he returns to his walk-up apartment. Growing up as “that fat kid”, he had problems losing weight and developed low self-esteem . By age 15, he was morbidly obese, which meant that he had a body mass index of above 37.4. A normal body mass index is between 18.5 and 22.9. Mr Sim, now 34 and working as a programme manager at a bank, knew that it was only a matter of time before obesity led to medical problems . “You don't need a crystal ball to foresee that by my mid-30s, I would probably would have developed a chronic condition,” he said. He tried dieting and exercising, but losing a large amount of weight to attain a healthy weight felt impossible. “Most people struggle to lose even 1kg to 2kg. What more someone who needs to lose 20kg and more?” Bernard Sim Mr Bernard Sim when he was 18 years old. Bernard Sim Mr Bernard Sim with his wife in a photo taken in 2020. In late 2020, he consulted a doctor at a polyclinic and was referred to the Switch team at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH), where he underwent a sleeve gastrectomy. This is a type of weight loss surgery that removes a portion of the stomach to make it smaller. There are two common types of bariatric surgery and Mr Sim chose sleeve gastrectomy. Switch, which stands for Sengkang Weight Improvement Therapy and Complete Health, uses an evidence-based weight loss programme to help people lose and maintain weight in the long term. The surgery was a success, but as the kilos melted away, Mr Sim faced a new problem: Excessive skin folds that interfered with his self-confidence and quality of life. Describing the skin folds as “overhanging off the belly” and “drooping down towards the groin area”, Mr Sim said that they made him feel self-conscious. There was also the matter of hygiene and a risk of skin infection due to the skin rubbing, friction, moisture trapped in between the folds and rashes that can happen. “Going out on a hot day, I’ll be drenched in my own perspiration in 15 minutes or fewer. Naturally, there will be some odour. “And if it wasn’t pleasant for me, it wasn’t pleasant for anyone,” he said. Despite having lost 50kg to 60kg of body weight, he still mostly avoided activities that required him to remove his shirt, such as swimming. “I could (go swimming) perhaps, but it’d be unsightly for others.” After consulting the Switch team, Mr Sim decided to undergo another surgery in 2021 — this time, to remove the excess skin. Around 6kg of excess skin consisting of skin tissue was removed in a type of body contouring surgery known as a circumferential belt lipectomy. During the surgery, excess pannus — the area of skin and fat that hangs over the pubic region — was removed around the entire circumference of the body. Dr Kok Yee Onn, a consultant with the plastics, reconstructive and aesthetics service at SKH who performed the surgery on Mr Sim, said that the remaining skin was “pulled down to meet the groin along the underwear line”, so that the scar is concealed. Recognising that some people may think that these surgeries were the “quick and easy way out” to lose weight and excess skin, Mr Sim — who now weighs about 90kg — told of the determination required. “It took me a lot of resolve, pain and discomfort to get to this point,” he said of the two years from the time he underwent bariatric surgery, then body contouring surgery and recovery. “But it's worth it, and I encourage those who recognise that they cannot (lose weight) on their own to explore this avenue with their doctors. “You don't need to be held back by your frame, by how you look.” WHAT BODY CONTOURING SURGERY INVOLVES The Switch programme at SKH adopts a multidisciplinary-team approach to help patients lose weight and maintain a healthy weight. Bariatric surgery and post-bariatric body contouring surgery are among its clinical services. It is estimated that more than half of the patients who had bariatric surgery at SKH underwent body contouring surgery or were interested in body contouring surgery, though the hospital did not give the exact numbers when asked. In addition to younger patients, the team has seen more older patients in their 50s and 60s seeking to be “healthier and more active”, Dr Kok said. Bariatric surgery is surgery that achieves weight loss by restricting the amount of food the stomach can hold . Patients typically spend two to three days in the hospital and are ready to return to work within three to four weeks, SKH states on its website. As with any surgery, there may be potential risks as well, such as bleeding, leaks and infection. As for body contouring surgery, one private doctor said that she performs one to three a month. Dr Lee Hanjing, visiting consultant and plastic surgeon at PanAsia Surgery, said that the ages of most patients ranged from their 20s to 50s. A common misconception about body contouring surgery is that it is a cosmetic procedure, but there are medical reasons involved. Dr Kok from SKH explained that body contouring surgery is “a medical procedure that is aimed at improving a person’s health and function”. Typically, it involves removing excess skin and fat from various parts of the body such as the abdomen, thigh and chest. It is done through a series of incisions or liposuction, followed by reshaping and tightening of the remaining tissues. Dr Kok said that doctors may recommend body contouring surgery after bariatric surgery, depending on individual circumstances. “Unlike cosmetic procedures like tummy tucks, where patients are well and desire enhancement of a normal body, body contouring offers more than just aesthetic benefits,” he added. He also said that the decision to undergo body contouring surgery is “highly personal” and should be discussed with a plastic surgeon. Another thing to note is that not everyone is suitable for body contouring surgery. Patients with significant medical issues (such as severe ischemic heart disease) or unstable weight may be considered unsuitable candidates, Dr Kok said. “Those with unstable weight are not suitable as they may end up gaining weight after body contouring surgery and waste the efforts of having gone through it.” WHY EXCESSIVE SKIN FOLDS APPEAR AFTER DRASTIC WEIGHT LOSS Dr Lee from PanAsia Surgery explained that following massive weight loss, the soft tissues of the body (underlying skin and fat) deflate as weight is shed. Typically, the amount of weight loss after bariatric surgery tends to be greater than that achieved through natural weight loss. “The skin that had been previously stretched out would now appear as loose skin with folds, because the quality of the skin following massive weight loss or bariatric surgery has poorer elasticity,” she said. “ For some people, it significantly affects their mental health and causes low mood and even depression. In severe cases, the large skin folds may cause mobility issues, increase the risk of infections and cause wounds with repeated hospital admissions. Dr Kok Yee Onn, a consultant with the plastics, reconstructive and aesthetics service at Sengkang General Hospital ” Dr Kok highlighted that excess skin after drastic weight loss can interfere with daily activities, cause discomfort and affect the person’s self-esteem. It is also an obstacle to keeping good hygiene since cleaning between skin folds can be hard. “For some people, it significantly affects their mental health and causes low mood and even depression. “In severe cases, the large skin folds may cause mobility issues, increase the risk of infections and cause wounds with repeated hospital admissions,\" he added. Dr Lee said that “it is not possible” to prevent excess skin after drastic weight loss, and the best way to manage it is to surgically remove it. “The excess skin is a result of the weight and stretch from when the patient was at his maximum weight. “When the soft tissues deflate following weight loss, the surface area of the excess skin is generally still the same as before,” she explained. Dr Kok pointed out that although toning exercises may improve muscle tone, they cannot effectively address excess skin after significant weight loss, which often requires surgical intervention. “The best-case scenario… is the body naturally adapting over time with some minor skin contraction, but not to the extent achieved by surgery,” he said. HOW BODY CONTOURING SURGERY IMPROVES HEALTH Dr Kok said that about four in five patients who have undergone bariatric surgery desire body contouring surgery. Besides improving confidence and psychological well-being, studies in American and Asian medical journals have shown that patients who had body contouring surgery after bariatric surgery experienced significant improvements in physical function and quality of life, Dr Lee added. For instance, a pilot study published in 2023 in the Biomolecules and Biomedicine medical journal found that body contouring surgery led to short-term improvements in insulin resistance. Those who had weight loss surgery also had better long-term blood sugar control and were less likely to experience severe blood sugar spikes compared to those who did not. Even after a person loses a lot of weight, fat may remain under the skin. Dr Kok said: “Body contouring can also improve the patient’s chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension by removing fat, which is a metabolic burden. “In some cases, patients have been cured of their diabetes and hypertension after undergoing bariatric surgery and body contouring surgery.” Dr Ben Ng, an endocrinologist at Arden Endocrinology Specialist Clinic, said it is important to be aware that body contouring procedures are “not a treatment for obesity , and not a weight-loss method”, although fatty tissue is removed from certain parts of the body during the procedure. Although there are several studies looking at the potential metabolic improvements using body contouring surgery, the evidence is “limited at present”, Dr Ng noted. “Currently, metabolic surgery such as the gastric sleeve that targets visceral obesity (fat around the internal organs) are showing the best clinical benefit. “Procedures such as body sculpturing may help, but definitive scientific data on the benefits of these procedures are still lacking.” Dr Ng explained that when a person gains weight, each fat cell increases in size. “During liposuction, for example, the fat cells in a specific area are permanently removed and this alters the shape of the body. “However, if the patient does not maintain a healthy lifestyle, the remaining fat cells will grow bigger,” he said. Body contouring procedures remove subcutaneous fat, which is the fat just under the skin, and not visceral fat. Visceral fat has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and high blood pressure. That said, body contouring procedures can potentially help from a psychological perspective and motivate individuals to want to exercise more, Dr Ng said. “For health benefits and improvements to chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, it important to consider more evidence-based procedures such as metabolic surgery. “I would encourage all patients desiring weight loss to discuss in greater detail with their doctors,” he added. Dr Lee from PanAsia Surgery observed that patients generally feel more confident after body contour surgery, which improves their emotional and mental well-being as well as motivation to keep fit. WHAT RECOVERY PERIOD IS LIKE AFTER SURGERY After body contouring surgery, Mr Sim found that managing the drains and negative-pressure wound therapy machines attached to his body was the most challenging part of his recovery. After the surgery, surgical drain tubes, compression garments and supportive pressure support devices are usually used to enhance recovery, Dr Lee said. Mr Sim had about two negative-pressure machines and four surgical drain tubes attached to his body immediately after the surgery to remove excess fluid and promote healing. “I had to sleep with the surgical drains as well. There were occasions when I found myself just bound up right in the middle of the night and had to untangle myself. “Going out with a hospital bag and tubes sticking out my body also led to some uninvited attention,” he recalled. After the surgery, he was in the hospital for about six days. About three days after he was discharged, he was re-admitted to the hospital for a wound infection. The attachments finally came off about two months after surgery. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Mr Bernard Sim pictured at his walk-up apartment on May 23, 2024. Dr Kok said that the scars usually heal in two to four weeks, and patients can be back to doing physical activities a month or two after that. In the first few months after scars heal, however, exercises that cause excessive skin tension such as sit-ups must be avoided. Moderate activities such as jogging can start from the second month after scars heal; more intensive exercises usually from the third month. HOW MUCH DOES BODY CONTOURING SURGERY COST Dr Lee from PanAsia Surgery said that the cost depends on factors such as the areas being done on the body. Several areas can be combined in the same surgical setting. If multiple areas are bothering the patient, the surgery may be split into different operations. The amount of excess skin removed also varies. Body contouring surgery following bariatric surgery is subsidised at public hospitals because it leads to health improvements in chronic disease, confidence and function, Dr Kok from SKH said. It can also be claimed using the patient’s Central Provident Fund Medisave account. Mr Sim estimated that he paid around S$4,000 for the bariatric surgery and body contouring procedure after subsidies. He stayed in a Class C or six-bedder ward. DIFFERENCES BEFORE AND AFTER WEIGHT LOSS AND SURGERY The drastic weight loss and extensive body contouring surgery have been life-changing for Mr Sim. Recalling how he used to “stick out like a sore thumb” everywhere he went because of his weight, he said: “Living in Asia where most people have a smaller frame, it completely pulverised my self-confidence. “You go on a bus and you’re not able to share seats with people. “Your size is the first impression that people have of you, so right at the onset, everyone just knows you as ‘that fat kid’ — and that becomes your complete identity.” He would frequently get unwanted questions about his weight. “Out of nowhere, I would have people asking, ‘Have you thought of losing weight?’ or saying, ‘If you lose weight, you’ll be very handsome’. “It got to a point where I would expect these comments all the time. “I just carried on with life — not that it didn’t hurt,” he said. In social and professional settings, Mr Sim felt that he was often overlooked when he was at his heaviest. “I noticed that I wasn’t as ‘seen’ or ‘heard’ when I was at my heftiest — ironic. “I think there was a pre-judgement, that maybe bigger-sized guys don’t really know their stuff,” he added. “Whereas today, I notice that people and colleagues are more likely to want to get into conversations with me and understand my thoughts, whether it's seeking out my opinion or clarifications.” Bernard Sim Mr Bernard Sim and his wife on holiday in Indonesia in 2023. Besides having newfound confidence, Mr Sim also appreciates being fitter and more mobile. “I live in a walk-up apartment and now, I can get from the ground floor to my unit really quickly — that’s something I’ve never experienced before. “Previously, I will probably have to take breaks, struggle a lot. Getting onto airplane, sharing seats and sitting next to people, I don’t feel as self-conscious anymore. “Being able to be myself and not get pre-judged based on how I look is probably the icing on the cake.” Related topics Health obesity skin body image weight loss Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-Q0ng-wEgUfM')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-3N5u8lBKDoM')); Trending Content is loading...

Ms Wee Ai Ling, 31, is a hospital-to-home community nurse with the Singapore General Hospital She manages patients who are discharged from the hospital and are well enough to go home Community nursing, piloted here in 2018, emphasises preventive health and patient empowerment The number of community nurses have since been growing significantly Ms Wee was inspired to become a community nurse after working at the hospital's intensive care unit By Shynn Ong By Shynn Ong Published June 1, 2024 Updated June 3, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Think \"nurses\" and most people would picture health professionals bustling around a busy, sterile hospital setting. It is time, though, to broaden that notion now with the emergence of a growing number of community nurses. For Ms Wee Ai Ling, the sphere of work for nursing extends far beyond hospital walls, encompassing a vital role often performed far from the public eye. The 31-year-old is a hospital-to-home community nurse with the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), whose work revolves around managing patients who are discharged from the hospital because they are well enough to go home. The community nursing programme places an emphasis on preventive health and the empowerment of patients to take charge of their health. Piloted in 2018, it has become a permanent feature of the healthcare scene here. Ms Wee is part of a growing cadre of healthcare professionals who play this crucial role in delivering holistic care and support to patients beyond the hospital environment. Like their hospital peers, these nurses wear uniforms. The number of community nurses at various health service providers has jumped over recent years as the role became more integral to the health system. The number under the National University Healthcare System (NUHS) — which includes National University Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Alexandra Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital — rose from 10 in 2017 to about 50 in 2023, CNA news channel reported last year. Tan Tock Seng Hospital has seen its numbers more than double from about 20 nurses in 2018, while Singapore General Hospital has 82, up from 34 in 2018. Ms Wee said in an interview with TODAY: \"Nowadays, due to the Healthier SG initiative, everything is about preventive health and empowerment. \"You do very little on (preventive health) when you are working in the hospital environment, but when I work in the community, I am able to empower my patient to take charge of their own health and to stay well.'' When I prepared to meet Ms Wee on a recent Monday morning, I expected a chatty, outgoing individual given that interacting with a diverse number of people is part of her job. Instead, Ms Wee struck me at first as a meek and mild figure, her soft voice and quiet demeanour the complete opposite of what I had expected. She may have been unassuming in nature, but I got a better sense of her true character as I observed her conversing with a doctor about a patient. She readily answered the doctor's questions, offering insights and recommendations with precision and clarity. Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Ms Wee Ai Ling conversing with a doctor about the patients under her care before heading out for home visits on May 20, 2024. Perhaps her reticence stemmed from the presence of the TODAY photographer who was following her about in the busy office located in SingHealth Tower within the hospital grounds that was bustling with numerous other healthcare workers. Ms Wee's demeanour transformed entirely when we later accompanied her to visit a patient for a post-hospitalisation check-up. She become more cheerful and talkative when she spoke to him and his caregiver. BECOMING A COMMUNITY NURSE Nursing was not Ms Wee's chosen vocation. She had graduated with a diploma in food science and technology, before taking on a nursing degree at the National University of Singapore (NUS). \"To be honest, I did not always want to be a nurse. I wanted to be a dietitian,\" she said. \"When I found out that I was eligible for a nursing degree offered by NUS, I decided to go for it and when school started, I fell in love with every aspect of nursing.\" Ms Wee added that her decision to study nursing was a leap of faith for her and came with a steep learning curve. \"It wasn't an easy switch from my food science and nutrition background into nursing, because most of my peers already had a nursing diploma, so they already had a nursing background to help them in their studies. Whereas for me, I had to start from scratch.\" She had to put in extra effort to catch up with her peers, especially in the practical aspects such as inserting a urine catheter. After graduating from university, Ms Wee was posted to the general surgery department of SGH for two years, before making the switch to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU), where she worked for another five years. The impetus to work in aftercare came from observing how some ICU patients required interventions to help them breathe, such as tracheostomy where a tube that carries air from the throat to the lungs through the front of the neck. Ms Wee said that she decided she would like to be involved in a patient's aftercare following such invasive procedures, so in August last year, she applied for the hospital-to-home programme in order to become a community nurse. \"Aftercare is what I would say is very critical for the patient because if they are unable to be taken care of well in the community, or their caregiver cannot take care of them well, then they will come back to the hospital for a lung infection very easily,\" she explained. \"Working in the ICU, we don't usually do discharge planning. So, by joining community nursing, I get to be involved in what will happen to the patients after they go back home.\" Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Ms Wee Ai Ling's job involves doing phone and video consultations to follow up regularly with her patients after they have been discharged. Ms Wee's job now involves doing phone and video consultations to follow up regularly with her patients after they are discharged, as well as conducting home visits to ensure that patients are recovering well or their caregivers are taking the correct steps to reduce complications. \"Now as a community nurse in the hospital-to-home programme, I find it rewarding to see patients take charge of their health and transit smoothly back into the community,\" she said. MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PATIENTS' LIVES With most of her patients aged 80 and above, Ms Wee told me that she has to put extra effort into building rapport with them to convince them to change some of their ingrained habits. Some elders may be stubborn and resistant to change , she added. \"I once had a patient that smoked one pack (of cigarettes) a day and he had stage four lung cancer. So I had to spend quite a bit of time talking to the patient and explaining to him about the risks and consequences of smoking.\" At first, the patient did not take her advice well, but with regular follow-ups, she built rapport with the patient who eventually quit smoking. \"After all the home visits and the education that we gave him, he realised that he shouldn't be smoking so much since it can worsen his lung condition,\" she added. One way she builds rapport with patients is by speaking in the language and dialect in which they are most comfortable. Ms Wee told me that she is conversant in English, Mandarin, Malay and the Chinese dialect of Hokkien. There is the sense of fulfilment when patients are receptive to her advice, but there are bittersweet moments on the job as well. Recounting an incident where a patient of hers died shortly after one of her visits, Ms Wee said that the patient's daughter expressed her gratitude for the work she did. \"I checked in with the daughter and she was very appreciative, saying that thanks to our home visits, it helped them to know what to do when their father's condition worsened and to manage their father's last moments as well,\" she recalled. \"When I receive such compliments, I feel like I've made a difference and that our programme benefited them in the long run.\" As I followed Ms Wee on her rounds, I noticed her whole demeanour brightened when interacting with her patient, as she spoke in Mandarin, English and Hokkien so that the 90-year-old could better understand her. When I asked the man what he thought of Ms Wee's services, he gave a thumbs-up, saying in Mandarin: \"Very good! She helps me to take care of my health very well, she's very good.\" Ooi Boon Keong/TODAY Ms Wee Ai Ling checking on a patient during a home visit on May 20, 2024. As our interview concluded and we made our way to the lift lobby, I observed that Ms Wee lingered behind to have a conversation with the patient's son-in-law. She pointed out the patient's slightly swollen feet and advised the younger man to seek medical attention promptly if he noticed any worsening of the patient's condition, leaving me impressed by her meticulous attention to detail and strong sense of responsibility towards her patients' well-being. My initial impression of Ms Wee's meekness and diffidence had transformed into a profound appreciation for her dedication and passion. Witnessing her light up while discussing patient care and her zealousness in every interaction, I could not help but feel inspired by her and have no doubt that she will continue to make a significant impact in her career.

In 2006, 13-year-old Freddie Almazan was walking home from school when he was shot in the back of his head The attack left him partially paralysed It also marked the start of a decade-long battle with depression, before he eventually decided to turn his life around during his university years Now 31 and a youth motivational speaker, he wants to help others bounce back from the challenges they face in life He attended the Rotary International Convention 2024 held in Singapore, where he was a conference speaker By Deborah Lau By Deborah Lau Published June 2, 2024 Updated June 2, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Warning: This article discusses suicide. SINGAPORE — Nov 11, 2006 should have been like any other day for 13-year-old Freddie Almazan. All he remembers is that he was walking home from school that afternoon. Then he woke up in the hospital a few weeks later. He had been shot in the back of his head on his walk home in California. Till today, he does not know who had shot him. The incident, however, left him partially paralysed. It also marked the start of what would be a decade-long battle with depression, before he eventually decided to turn his life around during his university years. Today, Mr Almazan, a youth motivational speaker, speaks extensively about how one can find “beauty in the broken pieces”, and thus grow and bounce back from the challenges one faces in life. Because he decided to share his story, his words also saved someone from suicide. Mr Almazan was speaking to TODAY on the sidelines of the Rotary International Convention 2024, where the 31-year-old is a conference speaker. Rotary is an international service organisation connecting more than 1.4 million volunteers from more than 46,000 Rotary clubs globally to tackle issues of concern. The organisation meets at the annual Rotary International Convention, which is held in a different city each year. This year’s convention was held in Singapore between May 25 and 29, and saw more than 14,000 Rotary members and participants from 151 countries and more gather at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands. Rotary International Mr Freddie Almazan speaking at the Rotary International Convention in Singapore on May 27, 2024. ‘WAKING UP TO A NIGHTMARE’ Mr Almazan remembers little of what happened that afternoon in November 2006, apart from how much his life had changed as a result. “I just remember walking home and then a few weeks later, I remember waking up to what I thought was like a nightmare,” he said. He was surrounded by doctors at his bedside. They asked him several questions — including if he knew what the date was and if he could feel his arms. “That was when they told me that I had been shot.” The shotgun used in the attack had been loaded with several ball bearings. Some of these had hit the back of his head and neck, damaging his nerves and leaving him partially paralysed. He underwent many surgeries and therapy sessions — including physical and speech therapy — to regain his mobility and ability to speak. He was discharged from the hospital some time in January 2007, about two months after he was shot. He was caring for his little brother one night when the realisation of his situation fully hit him. “I thought the entire time that I was dreaming and that one day I would wake up. “Being there with (my brother) made me realise that maybe this wasn’t a nightmare, because every single day, it was the same story and I wasn’t going back to the way things were. I realised that... this is my life now.” When he eventually returned to high school later that year, things took a turn for the worst. “I started comparing myself to other people, and I realised nobody looked like me. I had a balance issue, and I was paralysed in my face. I was very different. \"I became very depressed. I started self-harming and I was even suicidal.” This marked the start of what would be a decade-long battle for Mr Almazan. It was when he studied sociology at the University of California that he decided to turn his life around. REBUILDING CONFIDENCE During his university years, Mr Almazan had the opportunity to spend a semester studying in Brazil — a chance he jumped at because he believed the new environment would do him good. Up till then, he had been very insecure throughout his schooling years because he feared that people would judge him based on the way he looked. He shied away from others and did not have many friends. “I thought if I went to a new country where everything was completely different and nobody knew anything about me, my life would change. “But I got to Brazil and I realised my life was the same.” The realisation that nothing had changed prompted Mr Almazan to ask himself if he wanted to continue living his life the same way — or if he would try to move forward with his life. He started making little changes to how he lived his life. One of his biggest fears was to talk to people, afraid that they would judge and reject him. Thus, a first step out of his comfort zone involved taking a risk to put himself out there and start talking to more people, Mr Almazan said. “Doing that and realising that nobody really cared about the way I looked gave me confidence to try more, and more, and more. “I started talking to more people, I started going out and I started doing things. “It wasn’t a shift overnight. It was just little things that I was doing over and over again, and I was slowly building my confidence.” ‘YOU SAVED MY DAUGHTER’ After his time in Brazil, which he described as an “emotional experience”, Mr Almazan knew that he wanted to share about this and to help others as well. Rolling up his shirt sleeve during the sit-down interview, he revealed a tattoo on his left arm that reads: “The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.” Mr Almazan recalled how — when he was applying to university — he had chanced upon clips of motivational speaker Nick Vujicic sharing his story online. “I remember thinking that I was going to do that one day, that I wanted to be like him one day,” Mr Almazan said, though he did not act on it at the time. One day, after he had graduated from university, Mr Almazan was speaking with a friend when he began sharing his story in detail with her for the first time. She got visibly emotional and asked if he would consider becoming a motivational speaker. Mr Almazan began to seriously explore how he could do so, and eventually signed up for a mentorship programme that would guide him on his motivational speaking journey. Months after embarking on the programme, he had a memorable encounter. “I was talking to this woman in my community. I shared with her my story and then she started crying, (saying) ‘Oh my god, you saved my daughter’,” Mr Almazan said. The woman’s daughter was also battling depression at the time. Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Mr Freddie Almazan showing the tattoo on his arm with words that remind him of his purpose in life. CELEBRATING SCARS On what he hopes others would also take away from his sharings, Mr Almazan said: “We can’t always control everything that happens in life — people go through things, and life happens. But these challenges don’t have to define who we are.” Referring to the Japanese practice of kintsugi — the act of repairing broken pottery by mending them with gold — from which he draws inspiration, Mr Almazan noted how people often try to replace broken things with something new. “But what kintsugi does is that it repairs that damage… and where it’s fractured, they cover it with gold, so it highlights the scars. “Kintsugi teaches us that our scars shouldn’t be something that we should be ashamed about. It’s something that we should be proud of, something that we should embrace, something to be celebrated.” He said that embracing this has helped him to realise that the challenges he faced were also what developed his character and made him who he is today. “(These challenges) gave my life a story. And because I have that story, my life is different, I am different, and I am more valuable because of that story.” WHERE YOU MAY SEEK HELP Samaritans of Singapore: 1-767 (24-hour hotline) or 9151 1767 (24-hour CareText via WhatsApp) Singapore Association of Mental Health: 1800 283 7019 Emergency helpline of the Institute of Mental Health: 6389 2222 (24-hour hotline) Related topics gunshot depression Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-I8idCBIe9TY')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-q3W48Mu7gx0')); Trending Content is loading...

An hour or so later, he found himself with several others on a trail in the forested area of Mandai in the wee hours of Jan 7, raring for action despite a lack of sleep. \"Jasper\" is not some National Service codeword flashing on a television screen, which signifies an ongoing mobilisation exercise for servicemen. Instead, it refers to the rare and elusive Jasper cat snake, which was spotted by a member of Mr Hamad’s “herping” chat group who alerted the rest of his sighting along a Mandai trail. This was the reason why Mr Hamad and four other members of the herping community were in Mandai: To catch a rare glimpse of the greyish-brown snake speckled with black and pink with their cameras. Herping refers to finding and observing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats. This often involves hiking, exploring and carefully observing different habitats to see these creatures to photograph them. Mr Hamad, who also goes by his Instagram handle \"Tobi\", said that it was a double delight because the group recently spotted another rare snake — a banded krait. “We were ecstatic mainly because the Jasper cat snake was an extremely unexpected, rare sighting, and this came seven days into the new year,\" the herping enthusiast said. Hamad Azam The Jasper cat snake photographed on Jan 7, 2024 at a trail in Mandai. Another avid shutterbug, Mr Terence Szeto, 32, said that interest in the wildlife photography hobby swelled during the Covid-19 pandemic when overseas travel was forbidden , though he said that their numbers probably declined after borders reopened. Still, that did not stop hundreds of passionate photographers and curious onlookers from gathering near a large tree in Telok Blangah in early May, after a pair of baby Sunda owls were seen nested there. The incident sparked ethical concerns about the role that these wildlife photographers play in an urban setting such as Singapore, with some people voicing their fears that such congregations risked affecting the young birds. Responding to these concerns, the wildlife photographers who spoke to TODAY urged their fellow shutterbugs not to take part in these large crowds around wild animals or stay for extended periods of time in order to avoid harming them. Mr Szeto said that he would rather avoid such crowds because of the added bonus of being able to enjoy the tranquillity that nature offers. He mainly photographs wildlife by himself or with his wife. Co-founder of Hatched Productions, a commercial video production company, he added: “The fun in the photography process is trying to find the animals by yourself, and I also prefer the quiet of nature.” Mr Hamad’s group believes in non-interference with nature as well. His posse of four photographers keep to official trails, since it is illegal to venture off marked paths. Anyone caught straying off designated trails in nature reserves can be fined up to S$2,000. Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Avid wildlife photographer Hamad Azam, 21, looking for snakes to photograph in Pasir Ris on May 28, 2024. Shutterbugs such as Mr Hamad urge others to put the welfare of the animals first. Mr Hamad, who specialises in photographing snakes and has been doing so for nearly three years, said that rushing out to spot rare creatures is especially memorable when they are the only humans there. At the end of the day, their photography hobby serves a bigger purpose of spreading awareness about the wild ecosystem here and should never be just about the photos alone. “I started wildlife photography to share with Singaporeans that we have all these amazing animals,” the youth said. “I want to eliminate the misconception and the fear that snakes are out to get you... in reality, they are not.” INSPIRED BY NATURE DOCUMENTARIES Both Mr Hamad and Mr Szeto said that their interests in animals came from watching nature documentaries from an early age. Mr Szeto said: “I grew up watching nature documentaries, like National Geographic, BBC Earth and all that, and that got me interested in animals.” That allowed him to combine his love for animals with his field of study, which was filmmaking at university. Terence Szeto Mr Terence Szeto (pictured), 32, an avid wildlife photographer who mostly photographs primates. At first, Mr Szeto was drawn to primates such as orangutans and other “ big, charismatic animals ” that could only be found overseas, including tigers in India and rhinos in Nepal. During the pandemic lockdown, when he could not travel to these locations, he started to focus on wildlife in Singapore. “I didn’t know that there were so many species locally. If you put the charismatic giant animals aside, you will find that Singapore has many very interesting species to offer.” Like other budding wildlife photographers, Mr Szeto was amazed at the biodiversity that a tiny island such as Singapore has to offer — from more than 400 species of birds to being home to rare animals such as the culogo (a small mammal resembling a flying squirrel with webbed feet that glides), the mouse deer and the pangolin . As for Mr Hamad, who also found himself drawn to animals through nature documentaries, it was the Instagram page of well-known nature photographer Jayaprakash Bojan here that made him take the plunge. “I got inspired, so I took my sister’s camera (an old Nikon digital SLR) and went to Pasir Ris Park for fun,” Mr Hamad said, adding that he was hooked after spotting his first snake, a mangrove pit viper, there. “I couldn’t believe it because, wow, a viper in urban Singapore.” Terence Szeto A Raffles' banded langur photographed by Mr Terence Szeto, after he spent nearly a year looking for them in the wild in Singapore. The langur is known for its distinctive black fur and white bands on its chest and inner legs. Miss Zoee Lim, 22, an ecologist who first came up close with animals following a volunteering stint at the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) from 2017 to 2022, said that she got into the hobby after that. In addition to her work as a fauna specialist for biodiversity consultancy, Miss Lim does guided walks, wildlife photography and raise caterpillars. She photographs a variety of insects and reptiles, and said that these macro images of spiders, millipedes and butterflies help people see “beauty in the small stuff”. “I like to give a voice to the voiceless,” Miss Lim said, having been in the wildlife scene for seven years. “My goal is to capture the beauty of creatures that people would not even glance at and show that they, too, have their own intrinsic value.” Her motivation for photographing insects is in the hope that people can slow down to appreciate nature. “I want to sort of be the bridge between humans and wildlife to help humans appreciate and understand nature more,” she said. “Hopefully, this might inspire some people to want to protect them even more.” Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Ecologist Zoee Lim (pictured), 22, photographs a variety of insects and reptiles as a hobby, after being exposed to animals at a younger age. THE SNAKE PIT OF WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY The photographers interviewed by TODAY said that most people do not realise how physically demanding wildlife photography can be, because it involves walking or hiking long distances, lying in wait for subjects to appear, and carrying heavy camera equipment. After all, when it comes to wildlife photography, shutterbugs may not always get their payoff since their subjects can come and go as they please. When Mr Hamad began taking photos of wildlife, he started with birds and found out that patience was a key aspect of the hobby. “There is a lot of walking and a lot of waiting. I think the longest I’ve waited for a bird to show was about four hours.” For snakes, the difficulty level ramps up more since these creatures are better at hiding from humans, Mr Hamad added. Outings can begin at 9pm and last until 5am. More often than not, these trips also end in vain. However, he said that insects are the hardest to photograph, given their size and closeness needed to shoot them, especially with a macro lens. For a higher chance of success with insects, doing some research about their habitat and having some in-field experiences will help. “(Photographing insects) is the hardest because even if you do get to spot a spider, then comes getting the proper angles of it, and they can scurry off anytime,” Mr Hamad said. Then, there is the constant frustration of not getting the shot, which can leave some young photographers disheartened. “I’d say that for most people, there will be other outings where you will go out and you will not get a single image at all, or a single usable image,” Mr Szeto said, adding that this may scare away budding photographers. “But I think it’s very rewarding when all the stars align.” For him, it took several months before he spotted the Raffles’ banded langur , which is a type of monkey with its distinctive black fur and white bands on its chest and inner legs. Mr Szeto said that since the langur prefers to be high up in trees, it can be challenging to get a good angle of them. “I think it took maybe a year to finally get that particular shot that I wanted.” Besides relying on chance and an individual's skills, wildlife photography can also be an exercise in teamwork, because it often depends on a community of like-minded spotters to track down rare creatures in the wild. Although the wildlife photography community here is generally friendly and welcoming to young photographers, with so many people vying for that one shot, some friction is bound to happen, those interviewed told TODAY. Mr Szeto said that he has seen squabbles among fellow shutterbugs who try to \"gate-keep\" certain locations where they found sightings of rare creatures, though such conflicts happen infrequently. Agreeing, Miss Lim said: “It has moments where it can get overly competitive. “If your luck happens to be better than others, (other photographers) will be very competitive in sharing locations (of animal sightings) with you.” Zoee Lim A shore pit viper, known by its nickname Blu, as photographed by Miss Zoee Lim. The snake rarely makes an appearance and typically emerges once a year. THE ‘HIGH’ OF GETTING THE PERFECT PHOTO Despite the challenges, Miss Lim said that the hobby is a rewarding one. She recalled how she managed to photograph a shore pit viper nicknamed “Blu” in Pasir Ris Park in June 2022. Blu was so named because shore pit vipers in Singapore are primarily purplish brown, but the one that she saw had a brilliant blue colouring on its head. To add to the allure, Blu is known to only make a public appearance once a year or every few years, making sightings of it extremely rare, she said. When a friend tipped Miss Lim off that Blu was found, she was in the middle of entering data from a field study. She dropped everything she was doing and went down to catch a glimpse of the snake as soon as she got the message. “The distance it was at was perfect. The shot was beautifully framed, and it wasn’t moving,” Miss Lim said of the photograph she took of Blu. The photographers admitted that the euphoria of getting the perfect shot can sometimes lead people into a frenzy. Mr Hamad said that he has witnessed photographers prioritising their photographs over the welfare of the wildlife. \"I can tell they are about getting the shot. They don’t really care about the welfare of the animal, or (are not there) to admire them.” In the end, ethics and the welfare of the animal can sometimes take second place. In the case of the Sunda owls, many nature groups voiced their concerns over the crowds gathered around the nest. The Singapore Bird Society said in a statement on its website: “Nesting birds are sensitive. When they sense that the site they selected is untenable, abandonment can happen.” On May 10, Acres said on Facebook that photographers and members of the public should minimise crowding in the area when the owlets were learning to fly. “This is a critical stage, and we sincerely appeal to photographers and the public to not surround the area. \"Presence of many people around fledged owlets can prevent the parents from giving the much-needed guidance,” the animal welfare organisation added. NO NEED TO OBSESS OVER THE 'POKEDEX' For Mr Hamad, he said that there were times when he was caught up in getting the shot and filling up his \"Pokedex\" with rare animals. A Pokedex — the term originating from the Pokemon game franchise — is used to describe a comprehensive collection or database of related items or knowledge. “I found myself no longer doing this as a hobby, and I was chasing after these birds. I found it quite unhealthy, so I took a break,” Mr Hamad added. An unhealthy obsession beyond the point of rationality can explain why some photographers end up crossing the line. Ultimately, they have to ensure that the welfare of the animal must be at the forefront of their hobby. “I definitely try to place the animal’s welfare above my own photography needs,” Mr Szeto said. Noting that some photographers would clap or make loud noises to get the animals to look at the camera, he said that such acts go against what nature photographers stand for in their work. \"While I (may not) have such a high chance of getting great images to take home, at least I won’t feel guilty, because I don’t do any of those (actions),” Mr Szeto added. Miss Lim agreed, saying: “Yes, you might desperately want the perfect shot, but what are you willing to give up in exchange for that? “The animal should come first. Your photographs should not be the priority.” Related topics nature nature groups wildlife photography Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-IjEK11jKBqA')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-RUUWjRpj2V0')); Trending Content is loading...

Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. In a bid to better control the time spent on electronic devices, one of TODAY's journalists tried a health fad Commonly known as a \"dopamine fast\", it is to refrain from activities that trigger dopamine release Mental health experts said it is all right to falter at the start of this \"fast\" They suggested that it might work better if it is done progressively rather than go cold turkey By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 3, 2024 Updated June 4, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — My family recently pointed out that even outside my official working hours, I spent a significant amount of time glued to my mobile phones or tablet, sometimes until late at night. I demurred, saying that those little pockets of time are just moments for me to unwind from work before moving my focus to something else. Deep down, though, I was aware how the bad habit could affect my life, if it hasn’t already. First, it was taking a little time away from the family. Second, it was eating into time that I could otherwise use to do things I truly enjoy, or at least have proper rest . Incidentally, someone in the office mentioned a health fad called “dopamine fasting”, a way to detox and untether from our digital devices, among other things. Sure, she brought this up as a not-so-subtle way of asking me to try it out and write the next Gen Zen column. But hey, it sounds like a potential solution to my situation, so I gave it a whirl for about a week. For sure, this is not the only way to unplug. Some colleagues tried other ways, like going cold turkey for a longer period. More of that in the coming weeks. But for me, I’m just taking the small step by trying to conscientiously cut the time spent on my devices — and so far, I’ve gotten mixed results. WHAT IS DOPAMINE FASTING Dopamine is known as a \"feel good\" hormone, so in today's age, digital scrolling is a type of activity that gives people pleasure. Some proponents believe that such activities may lead to reduced sensitivity to dopamine. Hence, dopamine fasting is simply the act of unplugging ourselves from our phones, in the hope that it can help the brain’s dopamine receptors “reset”. However, experts believe that this may be an oversimplistic or even erroneous take on dopamine. Dr Lim Boon Leng, private psychiatrist from Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, said: “It’s pertinent to note that the dopamine reward pathway is hypothetical and dopamine fasting is somewhat of a misnomer as it suggests our dopamine level can be directly manipulated by behavioural changes.” Dr Praveen Nair, senior consultant at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, also said that there may be a misunderstanding of the purpose of dopamine. He added that the dopamine systems within the brain are “implicated in addictions”, but also in memories and behaviour reinforcement. “Do note that getting dopamine is not a bad thing. Someone else can get the same sensations from playing tennis, for instance, compared to playing video games. “The truth is that many of the suggestions of this trend are part of more established therapeutic modalities such as mindfulness. The overall package, though, appears to be a simplification of complex neural mechanisms, which can lead to misunderstanding and misuse.” For me, I feel that if I can do Ramadan fasting yearly, going 13 hours without food and drink, how hard could it be to just cut down on X (erstwhile Twitter) and the ‘gram, right? Wrong. JUST UNPLUG? NOT SO... FAST I tried this “fast” for the first few days by simply filling up my schedule with leisure activities. This way, I thought I could cut down the free time on hand I can spend on my phone. On the first day (it was a Friday), I took more than an hour of slow walking at a park near my home before work. The second day was filled with errands-running and other activities, while on the third, I caught up on shows, went out and sang karaoke for three hours. (I almost lost my voice, but Celine Dion makes it worth it.) In that manner, I fully occupied myself from 8am to 8pm, or so I thought. And I felt good — physically and mentally — after doing these activities, so I really came out thinking that I’ve successfully fasted. To my surprise, when I opened the application activity tracker on my phone on the fourth day, I discovered that I have been spending roughly the same amount of time (if not more) on my social media apps as before. Upon a quick reflection, I realised that I might have, out of habit and without noticing, slid in pockets of time to glance at my social media apps throughout the day. At night, I pushed back my bedtime significantly to catch up on the social media scrolling I had missed in the day. So I took a more drastic measure, setting a time limit for my commonly used social media apps to half the amount of time I was spending on them. Over the next few days I did this, I felt that it did not help much. More than once, I tapped the \"add 10 more minutes to timer\" prompts when the time limit for the app ran out. But taking a step back, it’s better to have those pop-up reminders telling me I might not be doing as well as I thought in this fasting challenge, than to continue scrolling mindlessly for hours. IT’S OKAY, ‘YOU ARE HUMAN’ Dr Nair said it was okay that I found this difficult, “because you are human”. Dr Lim outlined four possible reasons I found it tough to cut myself off from my devices, despite wanting to do so: The use of screen time has become habitual; once formed, habits are hard to break We feel good when using social media, which triggers the release of dopamine, and the mind seeks these positive feelings The all-time presence of digital devices makes it very hard to avoid them or the temptation to use them There can be elements of behavioural dependency and addiction whereby a person may have withdrawal symptoms or discomfort trying to decrease screen usage Although using these devices more frequently than I’d like may be problematic, it does not necessarily mean that I’m addicted to social media, the experts assured me. “Addiction is often characterised by fixation on the addictive behaviour, compulsions to do so despite negative consequences, losing control over the behaviour and harmful use,” Dr Lim said. “Should these criteria be present, one should seek professional help.” However, barring an addiction, how problematic a certain level of behaviour (in this case, frequent usage of social media) is depends on the individuals, they emphasised. “For instance, being a reporter, it can be a safe assumption that being engaged with social media can have links to work (for instance, being closer to the latest news),” Dr Nair said. “As such, would such a behaviour really be maladaptive?” In the meantime, Dr Lim said that if I’m mindful that I indeed am having a problem, he suggested these practical steps to address them: Gradually decrease my usage of social media rather than go cold turkey Schedule breaks to step away from the digital devices Have alternative activities such as socialising and playing sports, to take myself away from the screen Looking at the steps, it sounds like I’m on the right track. I just have to keep it up and bear in mind that breaking old habits — especially ones that make you feel good — is not going to happen overnight.

Singapore has been seeing a number of wildlife sightings in urban areas The National Parks Board (NParks) Wildlife Management team was set up about five years ago to handle issues relating to human-wildlife interactions The team includes officers who manage public feedback on wildlife encounters, conduct awareness programmes in schools and do research on wildlife population dynamics By Shynn Ong By Shynn Ong Published June 8, 2024 Updated June 11, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Otters dawdling in shopping malls, wild boars roaming around heartland shops and crocodiles turning up at popular beaches are becoming more common on this island nation. As cities expand and natural habitats shrink, wild animals are venturing into human territories more frequently, increasing the need for effective management and co-existence strategies. These animals have captivated the public's attention with some people reacting favourably towards them, while others are less enthused — highlighting a complex challenge for the National Parks Board (NParks), which manages greenery, biodiversity conservation and animal welfare in Singapore. TODAY speaks to officers from NParks' Wildlife Management team, which was formed in 2019 and has around 30 staff members working to address public concerns while balancing the needs of wildlife creatures. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Ms Kerine Leong, wildlife management and outreach manager at NParks, near the Wallace Education Centre on May 27, 2024. FROM SNAKES AND OTTERS, TO BATS AND MACAQUES Unlike her peers who became teachers or worked in other literary fields, English literature graduate Ms Kerine Leong found herself drawn towards a career that involved caring for animals. After graduating from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2021, Ms Leong joined NParks as a wildlife outreach officer. She felt like it was the \"natural pathway\" for her to go into after doing internships at the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) as an advocacy and education intern and as a part-time keeper at Mandai Zoo. Her current role at NParks involves managing public feedback on wildlife encounters, as well as doing outreach events to various communities on how to safely respond when one chances upon such creatures. While it may seem odd to some, Ms Leong said that her job perfectly blends her passion for animals with her academic background. \"I think it's a good mix between the arts and my love for animals. I feel like my English literature degree helps to convey technical information such as wildlife safety measures in a captivating and engaging manner to the public,\" she said. Apart from this, Ms Leong also works with grassroots leaders, other government agencies and animal welfare groups to mitigate wildlife-related conflict and come up with win-win policies on animal management. \"For example, for issues related to otters, we work with members of the Otter Working Group which comprises representatives from government agencies, academia and the community to monitor the otter population and develop holistic solutions for otter issues,\" she said. While raising awareness and working with other agencies form part of her job, the bulk of her time involves handling feedback from members of the public. Together with other NParks officers, Ms Leong handled about 9,700 cases of feedback in 2023, although not all reports involved human-wildlife conflict. That number is an increase from the 8,200 calls in 2021 and the 7,900 calls in 2022. The most common species of animals that individuals seek help for? Snakes and bats, said Ms Leong. \"It can get quite daunting... because the calls that we receive involve different types of wildlife, from snakes and bats to otters. So it was quite challenging because you never really know what and when the next case might come in,\" she said of manning the NParks duty hotline. Ms Leong said that officers are required to react quickly in a calm manner and think on their feet. She also emphasised the delicate balance required of officers who have to navigate human-wildlife conflicts while empathising with members of the public. \"In some cases when people call us to say they have a snake in their house, I have to respond calmly so they don't panic. \"I once had a case where an otter ate a (house owner's) koi fish. The callers got a little bit frustrated so I had to be more patient and understanding and keep in mind that these people had lost their pet koi.\" After an officer receives feedback, certified specialists from third party wildlife management companies are activated to attend to the situation. NParks officers may then personally follow up with the feedback provider on site, or through email or a call if they prefer, and explain to them how to stop future occurrences. Mr How Choon Beng, group director of wildlife management at NParks, said that when dealing with wildlife like pest birds, long-tailed macaques and crocodiles, among others, NParks considers an array of different factors. This includes the species’ habitat range, natural behaviour, threats to public safety, animal welfare, as well as the impact on native biodiversity, habitats and the community. Basing their assessment on these factors, he said that a range of measures may be adopted, including public education, habitat modification to reduce food sources and translation of animals away from urban areas, among other things. Teaching homeowners about these options as well as how to prevent wildlife from entering their premises is also a part of Ms Leong's job. For example, she tells homeowners that they can prevent otters from entering by fitting their main entrances with exclusion barriers or closing their windows and avoiding putting food near windows to stop macaques from entering. Some outreach programmes that Ms Leong has conducted include roadshows for residents moving into new public housing estates near nature areas and conducting programmes for children with the National Library Board. \"There was once when this preschooler came up to me after my talk and told me 'I really enjoyed your talk'. It felt quite nice for someone so young to appreciate my talks,\" she said. Ms Leong also said that some animals like snakes \"get quite a bad rep\" because of how they are portrayed in the movies or shows. \"That's where my team comes in to help educate the public that snakes are very shy (creatures) and they wouldn't really come and bother you if you leave them alone,\" she said. \"Sometimes feedback providers might be quite against them (the animals) in the beginning, but seeing them change their minds after explaining to them wildlife behaviour is quite a rewarding thing.\" Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Monkeys at Dairy Farm Nature Park, May 27, 2024.

WILDLIFE — JUST LIKE REAL-LIFE POKEMONS As a child, Mr Tay Li Si spent a lot of time playing Pokemon games — which involves searching for different characters, including some elusive ones. The 27-year-old likens his current role as a researcher in NParks Wildlife Research Management to that of a Pokemon trainer. \"When I was younger, I played a lot of the Pokemon games. That was something that really inspired me because the animals and plants that we have around us are just like real-life Pokemons,\" said the Environmental Earth Systems Science graduate from NTU. His work involves conducting a variety of research projects, including field surveys like setting up cameras to monitor wildlife population dynamics. He also evaluates the effectiveness of human-wildlife conflict mitigation measures, such as crossing structures built to allow animals to traverse nature reserves safely. This includes a recently concluded study by NParks on wildlife crossings via culverts and roads at Old Upper Thomson Road. \"We have seen that they have been quite effective in facilitating the movement of animals and we do get quite a wide variety of animals using them including rare animals like the Sunda pangolin,\" he said, adding that the crossings reduce the likelihood of these animals ending up as roadkill. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Mr Tay Li Si, wildlife management research manager at NParks. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Mr Tay Li Si demonstrates how to attach an audio recorder to a tree for his field surveys to monitor wildlife on May 27, 2024. Since a significant portion of his job involves fieldwork two to four times a week, he has also encountered his fair share of surprises in the forest. \"Sometimes the weather may not be in our favour, sometimes we may take an unfamiliar path (and) a tree may fall. Or you may also come face-to-face with a wild boar or a snake may slither past you,\" he said. While these encounters sometimes startle him, he keeps in mind that these animals' first instinct is to run away and they do not mean any harm to humans. \"We are so much bigger than them, so they don't really want to approach us as well. As long as we are calm and collected they will move away on their own.\" Despite Singapore's land size, Mr Tay said that unknown to many, the nation is home to a wide variety of interesting wildlife and biodiversity, including the Malayan porcupine, spiny hill terrapin and giant forest ant. Part of his job is also to share as much information as possible about these animals to foster greater appreciation and understanding among the public. For example, the Asian Koel, known for its loud mating call — which Singaporeans have frequently complained about and termed as the \"uwu\" bird — also plays a special role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. \"The Asian Koel is known to be a brood parasite of the house crow. So in a way, they help to manage and reduce the population of crows in Singapore,\" said Mr Tay. A common question his team is frequently asked about is the population size of different species. Mr Tay said the question, while seemingly simple, is very difficult to answer and requires a lot of research strategies to collect data to model and estimate the population sizes. Despite the challenges of the job, Mr Tay said: \"Being able to go out and be immersed in nature is something that I wanted to do since I was young. And I'm happy to be able to do this right now.\" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article cited Ms Kerine Leong giving advice to homeowners on ways to prevent intrusions by meerkats, and that she had graduated in 2022. This is incorrect, as she was referring to macaques and she graduated in 2021. We are sorry for the errors.

By Nikki Yeo By Nikki Yeo Published June 8, 2024 Updated June 10, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — As I inch closer to my 25th birthday, I find myself becoming increasingly nostalgic for when I was 15. Back then, I was thick in the struggles of secondary school mathematics, but with the perks of seeing my friends every day and being able to enjoy extended breaks in the form of school holidays. Financial decisions? Nothing more onerous than choosing what to buy for lunch at recess. Yet on the flip side of longing for my school days, as seen through rose-tinted glasses, is some wary wondering. Where did all that simple joy disappear to, and why? While this job at TODAY is not my first taste of full-time employment, my previous stint working in the education field abroad was reminiscent of residential college life. Back then, I was still immersed in the lively atmosphere of college activities and deadlines. Now, in my second year of full-time work since graduating in 2022, conversations with my friends in our rare catch-ups tend to inevitably revolve around what occupies most of our days: Work. And while there are perks, such as greater financial independence, so many of those around me are often tired and stressed. This could be from projects, anxiety about office dynamics, financial planning or an existential uncertainty about where all this is leading to. An NTUC Youth Taskforce identified the top three challenges faced by most young adults when transitioning from school to the workplace: Achieving work-life balance Adapting to the work environment Being able to decide on a career path without being limited by the expectations of others “In both the workplace and school, there are opportunities to meet diverse people and build social and professional networks, which are important for personal and career growth,\" said Ms Natasha Choy, the executive secretary of Young NTUC. \"However, school often provides a safety net, whereas the professional workplace can be an unfamiliar environment with new tasks.” In the spirit of my full-time role, I spoke with career experts and a counsellor to find out more on why the jump from school to work feels like such a leap for young adults, and how to better cope. SCHOOL VS WORK ENVIRONMENT Ms Shannon Toh, a career coach from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) career and attachment office, said young adults tend to hold onto the “student mindset” when first beginning work, such as approaching a task like submitting an assignment without thinking a few steps ahead or taking ownership of the given task. Unlike the teacher-student dynamic, fast-paced work environments may also leave little time for seniors to train new hires, leading them to face challenges in completing tasks and being criticised for poor quality work, she added. “Many who did not go through internships may find it challenging to apply theoretical knowledge to the real-world task given, which may cause them to feel demoralised.” Agreeing, Ms Amanda Tay, a counsellor at Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre (EMCC), said that while goals are pre-defined for students, there is no “one straight path to success” in a career, which can create a sense of loss. She said the academic environment is akin to riding a bike with training wheels, and the \"huge\" transitional challenges of full-time work are like having those training wheels removed. More than learning how to apply familiar content to real-world assignments, young adults also have to traverse the social minefield of interacting within a workplace hierarchy. “Even the most veteran colleague faces this challenge; learning to understand the complexity of office politics and work culture, and navigating through these winding roads may become a stressful situation for a lot of young adults,” said Ms Toh. 'FREE FALLING' INTO NEVER ENDING GRIND? In a conversation with a close friend from my school days, she called the transition to full time work after graduating university “free falling”, a metaphor experts said was apt, as work can feel endless in a less structured environment. Tasks are no longer apportioned into timetables but can come in the form of juggling multiple projects and abstract benchmarks like promotions or appraisals. The stakes of working life as compared to the academic world are also higher, as young adults begin to take on financial commitments such as insurance premiums, working towards a house and even caregiving responsibilities. The daunting ambiguity at the start of one's career stems from many youths still trying to identify their interests and strengths or come up with long-term goals, said Ms Eve Puan, a career specialist from NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). She added that many young adults commonly struggle to land their first job with limited work experience and may have had to deal with a stressful and repetitive job search process, which can affect young adults' confidence and self-esteem. Ms Toh from NTU said that project and task objectives at work, too, can be “ambiguous” during the initial planning stages, leaving young employees unsure of where or how to start. “In a workplace, while one is expected to ensure that the deliverables are met when a task is given, they are also expected to think ahead or strategise, and be prepared to make changes along the way,” she said. Employees also have to get used to last-minute changes, as projects can be scrapped before implementation or have to be reworked entirely, she added. “Young adults are still trying to find themselves, and it is common and normal to feel lost at some point, especially when the challenges are out of your control,” said Ms Tay from EMCC. Unlike the predictable routine of working independently or with similar age group peers for school assignments, working with different groups of people can be foreign and daunting. “Moreover, it is useful to manage your expectations that sometimes we must go through the mundanity of tasks, especially as a junior staff, before we connect the dots and grow stronger from it,” said Ms Tay. TLDR: I MISS MY FRIENDS Perhaps the most simple and crucial of all the ways work differs from schooling life is the isolation and inevitable distance that comes as young adults’ lives diverge into different careers. Coordinating hangouts at university was easy as my friends planned out their timetables to have rest days. But working across industries with different busy seasons and leave allowances has made rainchecks frequent and forgivable. Unlike the comfort and security of people who have seen me grow up, meeting people in the workplace can come with a side of “imposter syndrome”. Ms Tay calls this “the fear of not being able to live up to the company's, their families, or their own standards”. She said that having social plans with family and friends could help to keep young adults “grounded” as they navigate work-life boundaries. “Akin to being in education, time and resources are needed to be intentionally carved out, to strengthen and foster relationships and social lives outside of work,” said Ms Tay. That doesn’t mean you can’t be social at work, either, she added, as joining social activities at the workplace and social clubs or interest groups outside of work could help foster social connections in and outside of work. Even when conversations do tread towards day-to-day work life in social gatherings among friends, I often end up feeling much better overall after a catch-up or impromptu weekday dinner. This manifests in the office, too, where lunch conversations about the projects we’re each working on, or even non-work topics can lead to meaningful insights for a story, or life-related gems such as tips on meditation and crochet. SO WHAT CAN YOUNG WORKERS DO? Seek connection and fun Experts said that finding a way to stay connected with those we cherish and making meaningful bonds in the workplace are key strategies to cope. Ms Roberta Balagopal, a senior consultant at career counselling firm Gary and Pearl International, said that having fun often “falls by the wayside” in young adults’ transition to work. “We need daily doses of happiness to live, without this balance we can fall into burnout, and we've seen this happen at increasingly young ages, like (those in their) early 20s,” said Ms Balagopal. “Make time for hobbies and relationships, and make sure there is something fun to do daily, not save up for the weekend or a once-a-year holiday. It can be something small and simple; just do it daily.” Experts also suggested finding a mentor at work to speak to, as they can also share their experience and encouragement when work starts to look dreary. Structure your own time Restoring an independent sense of structure and forming a new routine, especially since workplace deadlines may be self-directed, is also important. Experts suggested making checklists, prioritising urgent to non-important and non-urgent work tasks, and building one’s own timeline, especially when handling multiple responsibilities simultaneously. Ms Balagopal added that cultivating skills in time management, to learn to prioritise one’s efforts and energy, is crucial to minimise stress. And learning how to say “no” is a key skill. A way of finding one’s own rhythm is giving oneself “protected time” at work, said Ms Toh from NTU, who recalled an alumnus who set aside lunch time to recharge herself. A CHANCE TO WORK ON ME Like my commiserating chats with peers, it was affirming to hear experts' assertions that I’m not alone in the “free-fall”, nor is it a new challenge as generations of students before me similarly took the leap into the workforce. Immersion in the workplace after almost two decades of school life is daunting, but Ms Tay suggested viewing the challenges as opportunities to learn more about oneself, such as reflecting on whether their definition of success is in line with the company's. Ms Puan from NTUC's e2i also suggested adopting a mindset open to learning to be put in good stead as one's career progresses, and working with a career coach to help one identify their skills gaps and plan out next steps. \"If you have been enjoying most of your work and company culture, it is likely that you’ve found the right fit,\" said Ms Puan. \"If the job aligns with your skills, values and long term goals, it will be easier to thrive and grow in the workplace.\" It is almost as if I’m “back to school” but on a whole new level of self-discovery, learning more about my values as I try to find my own healthy mix of work, life, and everything in between.

Since then, Ms Lam, 40, along with her husband Rudy Taslim, also 40, have shuttled between Ukraine and Singapore around 10 times. The couple were also granted residential status in Ukraine after being invited to do so. In that initial solo visit, Ms Lam lived at the refugee camp in Bad Blankenberg, Germany for a month, where she cooked for, counselled and cared for Ukrainian refugees. “When the month was up, we were supposed to come back to Singapore, but I just felt like I could do more,” Ms Lam told TODAY. “If these refugees were already so in need, I was wondering where is the need the most? I can only imagine it would be in Ukraine.” This prompted her to enter Ukraine itself to continue serving its citizens and residents on the frontlines of the war. Her husband joined her in June 2022. The couple are the founders of architecture firm Genesis Architects in Singapore, whose projects have included a resort in the Maldives, a residential development in Australia and various projects in Singapore. The success of the business helps to fund their humanitarian work in Ukraine, as well as other good works around the world, including helping vulnerable children in the Amazon basin in Brazil. In Ukraine, they have built more than 500 emergency houses for vulnerable members of the community, including the elderly, the young and the physically disabled. The homes are in various parts of the country, including villages near the cities of Lyman, Slavyansk and Kramatorsk, which are all in the country's east. Other emergency homes have been built in villages such as Moschun, outside the capital Kyiv. The projects also provide employment to Ukrainian locals, whom they hire to help build these houses. The couple are co-founders of humanitarian organisation Love on Ukraine. Besides building homes for vulnerable Ukrainians, they also bring in generators from the Netherlands, and provide free electricity and internet access to individuals and organisations such as hospitals and orphanages. This allows those in need to charge their mobile and medical devices, communicate with family members outside of Ukraine, and obtain information online on getting food and medical aid, if needed. To date, they have planted more than 80 “lighthouses” – the name they give to these areas of refuge – in several locations across Ukraine. Through Love on Ukraine, the couple also extend financial and social support to pregnant women who have lost their husbands to the war, and individuals with special needs or disabilities who are unable to leave the country. The couple, who shuttle between Singapore and Ukraine every 10 weeks or so, were awarded Ukrainian residential status by the government in 2022. Mr Taslim told TODAY that the Ukraine government recognised their commitment to rebuilding the country, and the couple were invited to apply for residential status. They were granted residency, which allowed them to continue their works in Ukraine. They will next return to Ukraine on June 13, where they will focus on setting up rehabilitation hospitals for wounded casualties, and train chaplains and community leaders involved in trauma counselling. They will also convert more vehicles in order to make them suitable for transporting casualties, and expand existing orphanages’ capacities. Before each trip back to Ukraine, the couple prepare themselves by spending time with their families. They also wean themselves off coffee, sugar and chocolate, and cut down their daily intake by one meal to ensure they can keep functioning even without easy access to food. The pair also obtain medication to regulate heart palpitations, which they experience at times while serving on the frontlines of the war zone. Mr Rudy Taslim and Ms Lam Bao Yan, founders of Genesis Architects, take on pro bono infrastructural projects globally, including building emergency homes in Ukraine. HEART WORK Ms Lam and Mr Taslim are no strangers to such work – with Love on Ukraine being just the latest in a string of humanitarian projects they are involved in. In 2013, the couple, who are Christians, attended Iris Harvest School, an evangelistic missions training school, in Mozambique. Ms Lam said: “Twelve years ago, after building many big malls and buildings and infrastructure, we asked ourselves: Could there be more to architecture than all these big buildings?” They decided to buy a one-way ticket to Mozambique to be trained as missionaries. It was also on that trip that the couple learnt how their specific skill sets could play a part in designing and building a local university, to create educational opportunities for the next generation, said Mr Taslim. Armed with a heart for mission work and equipped with vocational skills in architecture and entrepreneurial work, the pair sought to use their skill sets to practically meet different communities’ needs. For example, Mr Taslim’s architectural training has helped him to quickly identify basic amenities to be built into the emergency homes in Ukraine, to ensure they are “fit for purpose” and able to “withstand for a good number of years”. “Even after the war ends, people will still need to pick up their lives, to save money, before they can start building their homes again. “These houses are permanent and can last them till then. And even if they were to build a house after that, they can consider our homes as an extension of their final home.” Rudy Taslim Mr Rudy Taslim and Ms Lam Bao Yan with a recipient of an insulated house in Moschun, Ukraine, August 2022.

OTHER PROJECTS AROUND THE GLOBE Besides building insulated and shock-resistant homes for displaced Ukrainians, the couple have also taken on several other pro bono architectural projects around the world. These include building a university in Mozambique, a school for blind children in Rwanda, and an air strip in the jungles of Borneo to help evacuate members of the indigenous Dayak tribe who face medical emergencies. Most recently, the couple are working towards building a school in the Amazon basin in Brazil to bring education to children in the community who have been rescued from trafficking and exploitation. It took the pair 44 hours on four different plane rides to reach the community nestled in the Amazon rainforest. Ms Lam said: “(We want to) overcome injustice with good, and good looks differently to different people. ‘Good’ could look like a word of encouragement to some, (but to us) ‘good’ looks like our skill sets. “We are not politicians, neither are we militarians, so we cannot overcome injustice with these because we are not influential people like that. But we overcome all this injustice with the good that we know – our skill sets and our lives.” Rudy Taslim Mr Rudy Taslim (in yellow) attempting to create a cement block in Pinoh Selatan, Borneo, July 2023. Rudy Taslim Ms Lam Bao Yan and Mr Rudy Taslim with a family along the Amazon River, May 2024. NOT WITHOUT HARD WORK On how they fund these volunteer projects, Mr Taslim and Ms Lam said their work is largely self-funded through Genesis Architects. Mr Taslim said that their practice is “commercially sustainable”, which allows the couple to then redirect part of their profits into their pro bono projects. But to do so and ensure the business stays up and running, the pair continues to work remotely on their humanitarian trips – even if this means they have to log on or off in the wee hours of the day, amid the time zone differences. Along the way, the couple have also received donations from family and friends who offer to support the couple’s work in their own ways. “I think, in some ways, we kind of model it for them… like ‘I can’t go there, but I can help to maybe pay for 10 doors, or I can pay for 200 pairs of shoes for the children going to school’. And then they sort of started helping out very organically,” said Mr Taslim. Ms Lam added: “And it’s not just money, though money is important. Some of (our family and friends) give us very good professional advice… like teachers, counsellors, medical doctors, nutritionists. So these are very precious resources… and all this professional knowledge is very helpful for us.” Ultimately, their business is just a means to an end, and a way to ensure the pair can sustain their pro bono work. While building commercial architecture like shopping malls and hotels is great, Ms Lam said they hope to also construct buildings – such as schools and hospitals – which will create lasting impact on the generations to come. “We want to make an impact with our architectural practice for the human good, and not just for enjoyment.” THE ‘POWER OF ONE’ And while Mr Taslim said it is difficult to project what an “end goal” to their volunteer work would be, his hope is that the work they do would “demonstrate the power of one” and help others to recognise the difference even one person can make. “If we were all individually to really look at where we are, the potential circles of impact that we have, and plant the seed of impact right there and then – I think the world really can become a better and nicer place to live in.” Agreeing, Ms Lam said that everyone has different skill sets, backgrounds, connections and networks. What’s crucial is to be willing to “start small” and to serve in the ways one is able to. This could look like what some primary school children in Singapore did, when they wrote cards and drew pictures for the couple to distribute at a children’s hospital in Ukraine. Others, like a community of elderly women in Singapore, knitted several scarves in different sizes and materials for the couple to give out on their trip, said Mr Taslim. “We gave (these scarves) to them, and everyone was crying. They feel like ‘wow, I have never seen these grandmothers and I will never be able to see them’, but it touched their hearts. “I felt like these women are amazing. They really caught the spirit of just believing that they can make a change. “And you don’t have to go to Ukraine or Amazon to do this, but there are absolutely avenues even within Singapore for you to make a difference.” Related topics Ukraine architecture volunteer Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-ZutgRRFgJQI')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-s3MkVuYhiC8')); Trending Content is loading...

Mr Hossain said his home village does not have paved roads, which would make skating there “very difficult and dangerous”. Though he has worked here for almost 15 years, he started rollerblading only in April this year, after a friend introduced him to a skating interest group for migrant workers. Before this, Mr Hossain said he usually spent his free time on Sundays just relaxing, or going around Singapore to visit places of interest. But such is his love for his new pastime that he prefers to spend his free time skating these days. On what drew him to the sport, Mr Hossain said: “It’s very good, but learning is hard. Everybody has a sport they like – some want cricket, some want football. I like this one, my choice.” Mr Hossain is a member of a skating interest group made up of more than 200 migrant workers from four countries: The Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh and India. The group – the Skate Club Singapore – was founded by six friends from the Philippines in September 2022. It has since ballooned in membership through social media postings and word of mouth. Ms Ella Lyn, 35, one of the six friends who founded the interest group, told TODAY that she was very surprised when the group started getting bigger. She did not expect people to join them as they were not professionals in the sport, but she believes that prospective members probably saw the “energy, fun, good vibes and pictures of places we have been to ride”. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY A group picture of Skate Club Singapore at the 100Plus Promenade on June 2, 2024. ‘SKATING KEEPS US STRESS-FREE’ Ms Lyn, a domestic helper, said that the original group of six had started skating during the Covid-19 pandemic, as they were limited by the type of activities they could do outdoors together. They all grew to love the hobby. \"Skating helps us because it keeps us stress-free for the whole week,” she said. “I started with nothing, I didn’t know this type of sport. But we just tried it, and we like it. “We’re not professionals. Most of us just like the pictures we take while skating and the adventures in the park. We just enjoy it – the views, the parks – we can go around Singapore and we enjoy it.” Ms Lyn said the group welcomes anyone who wishes to join. The only prerequisite is that members buy their own rollerblades and safety gear such as knee and elbow pads. The club’s members take turns to guide and teach newcomers on the basics of rollerblading. Today, Ms Lyn is an administrator of the skate club. The group meets between 9am and 9pm every Sunday, at gate seven of the National Stadium’s 100Plus Promenade. A member of the group would usually cook and prepare food each week, which they share in the morning before setting off to skate, said Ms Lyn. They aim to attempt different routes each week, which could include skating from the stadium to East Coast Park, Marina Barrage or Marina Bay Sands. When TODAY met the group on June 2, they had just returned from skating at the Jurassic Mile along the Changi Airport Connector. Sporting a yellow and black custom-printed T-shirt designed by a club member, Ms Lyn said: “Actually we were just thinking, if we rode in one place or in one park and we were wearing different outfits with different colours, it’s not that nice. “So we thought it's better we have a uniform. So each place we go, we have nice pictures because we’re all wearing the same T-shirts.” The bright yellow shirts also serve as an avenue for recruiting new members. Ms Lyn said: “A lot of people see us and they go, ‘Oh! This is a skate club?’ when they read our uniforms. “When we go skating, people will approach us on how to join our team. So we just tell them to come to the stadium, buy your own gear and skates, and we will guide you.” To date, the club has had three iterations of their T-shirt. These include a long-sleeved version, to offer sun protection during long rides under the sun. The third and latest T-shirt design is an “international version of our uniform”, said Ms Mercy Dumlao, who designed the shirts. She is also part of the original group of six friends who founded the skate club. This version features the national flags of the four countries the club’s members hail from. The group also started a Facebook group to collate and share pictures of the views from their skate routes around Singapore. “Our old pictures and memories will stay there (online),” said Ms Lyn. “Because we are not citizens of Singapore, when we go home, at least we have memories of rollerblading here in Singapore.” Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Members of the Skate Club Singapore showing their skating moves at the 100Plus Promenade on June 2, 2024. A COMMUNITY AWAY FROM HOME It is also through the group’s Facebook page and other social media platforms such as TikTok that members Mr Mithu Arifurzaman and Ms Reynalyn Cidro came to join the club. Mr Arifurzaman, 36, a construction site supervisor from Bangladesh, joined the group in November 2022 after seeing their Facebook page. He remembered thinking that rollerblading looked fun, after watching some videos of the group. He did not know how to skate and only picked up the sport through the club. Today, Mr Arifurzaman also serves as an administrator of the skate club’s WhatsApp group for male members. As administrator, he helps to plan the club’s weekly routes, broadcasts announcements to other members in the WhatsApp group, and documents pictures and videos of their rides to be uploaded onto the club’s Facebook page. For Mr Arifurzaman, who works long hours from Mondays to Saturdays – sometimes stretching from 5.30am to 10pm – being able to spend his rest days rollerblading breaks the monotony of work and brings him happiness. “Coming here, I have more friends, more brothers and sisters… and I also enjoy (myself) more here,” he said. Agreeing, Ms Cidro said: “I joined the skate club because I want to enjoy my day off, and to meet others from other countries and be friends.” The 31-year-old domestic helper from the Philippines joined the group in October last year. She had reached out to club members after seeing videos of the club on TikTok. Ms Cidro picked up the sport in a day, and now also helps to coach newer members of the club. She said that Sunday’s skate trip from the National Stadium to Changi Jurassic Mile is her favourite route to date, and that she generally feels much happier being able to spend her free time rollerblading. Besides building new friendships and finding a community of their own away from home, Ms Joan Soria Villanueva, 38, said the weekly exercise makes her body feel good. While she was initially apprehensive as she did not know how to skate, she was thankful she could pick up the sport slowly and at her own pace through the club. Today, the domestic helper said she also joins her employer on rides to Marina Bay in their free time. Asked about her hopes for the club as it approaches its two-year anniversary in September, Ms Lyn said: “I hope for more people to join us and experience the good vibes – to share more ideas and opinions with each other. She added: “Being far away from our family is not easy, so we plan more excitement and help each other to be fit mentally. “As I always remind them, we are not (of the) same culture and character, but we can be the same by showing respect and being kind, so each and every one has the memories to remember when we go back home.” Related topics skater Migrant Workers hobbies sports Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-TP06c9zQmjM')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-b2tmv_WQJLE')); Trending Content is loading...

Since its opening on Jan 30 last year, some families with young children have been frequently visiting the Toy Library, which is located within Punggol Regional Library The only one of its kind in the National Library Board's network of libraries, the space is dedicated to children aged six and under, who can get to play with regular toys, educational aids, puppets and costumes for free Parents lauded the initiative and said their children picked up important values of sharing and saving money NLB also worked with Minds Fernvale Gardens School to offer work attachments to students to maintain the Toy Library Because of this programme, the special needs students have become more independent in managing themselves and learning to care for others By Jasmine Ong By Jasmine Ong Published June 9, 2024 Updated June 11, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Every week, Ms Summer Chen takes her one-and-a-half-year-old son to a special spot in Punggol Regional Library, where there is a children's wonderland for him to spend hours tinkering around with various toys and playing with other kids. Located in a corner of the library's ground floor, the Toy Library features some 70 educational toys that are meant for kids aged six and under to play with free-of-charge. He usually gravitates to puzzles or sensory toys, such as an orange-coloured toy board with locks and latches. Now and then, he summons the courage to interact with other kids — and the toys help to break the ice. \"Since coming here, he has learned to be more social and tries to interact with others,\" said Ms Chen, 31, who declined to give her son's name. \"(This is) unlike when he is at an outdoor playground, where he would keep to himself.\" The valuable social lessons that the place has given to her son is why Ms Chen and her husband are all too willing to commute for an hour each week from their home in Tampines to Punggol by public transport. Found within the five-storey Punggol Regional Library, which is located at lifestyle hub One Punggol, the Toy Library was opened on Jan 30 last year by the National Library Board (NLB) as part of Singapore's first public library to offer a range of services for persons with disabilities. Since its launch, Punggol Regional Library has welcomed more than 1.3 million visitors, making it the most visited library in 2023. The Punggol estate also has one of the highest proportions of children below five years old in its resident population, according to NLB's website. When TODAY visited last month at around 2.30pm on a weekday, there were five families visiting the brightly lit space, which consists of tables for children to play their selected toys as well as small booths for their parents or caregivers to watch over the kids . However, the toys cannot be loaned out and are only available for play and learning onsite at the library. The Toy Library is also managed partly by beneficiaries from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds) who help to sanitise the toys and maintain the cleanliness and tidiness of the space. Minds is a social service agency serving persons with intellectual disability, caregivers and their families. Ms Kavita Ilangovan, senior manager at Punggol Regional Library, said: \"We want to help young children aged six and below to learn through play as toys are an essential part of play, which comprises creative, dramatic and sensory elements.\" NLB is also continuing to explore opportunities to expand its offerings across the library network, collaborating with \"like-minded partners\" to maintain and extend the educational benefits of learning through play to more children, she added.

WHAT THE TOY LIBRARY OFFERS Apart from regular toys, the Toy Library also features educational aids, puppets, costumes as well as toys with sensory enhancements. Each cater to different types of play, which can be grouped into four categories. The first is to spur creative play, which aids a child's motor skills, hand-eye coordination and stimulates brain development. A second approach is dramatic play, which encourages the child to use his or her imagination to recreate scenes from stories. Next, some toys encourage sensory play, which develops a child's fine and gross motor skills, and cognitive growth. Finally, the library also features tinkering aids, which offer children the ability to experiment and find creative solutions to basic design and engineering challenges with their parents and caregivers. These toys are selected based on their educational value, developmental benefits, inclusivity and safety in order to cater to a diverse range of interests and abilities, said Ms Ilangovan. According to Ms Ilangovan, the Toy Library has around 70 educational toys, which include 10 costumes, five sets of puppets, seven sets of tinkering toys, and 48 sensory and creative play toys. They are also changed regularly to provide variety. Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Mr Andrew Tan’s daughters playing together with hand puppets at the Toy Library on May 27, 2024. LIBRARY HELPS KIDS CULTIVATE CURIOSITY: PARENTS Speaking to TODAY, Ms Chen, an engineer by profession, said she first heard about the Toy Library through a friend who showed her a photo of the location. The idea piqued her interest when she saw that it was an air-conditioned space with a variety of toys available at no cost. \"Looking for a similar indoor space is a big difficulty as most of them require a fee, so if we can find a free one in the library, it's great (for us),\" she said. Other parents also lauded the free initiative, adding that its presence helped impart important educational values to their young children. Ms Suhaila, 35, who declined to give her full name, said it was only her third time at the Toy Library, but she found that the space had offered her a good and interactive way for her youngest daughter to be engaged with literature, as she did not have a long attention span for reading. She said her older children have become more independent and curious as a result of visiting the library, and she wanted the same for her youngest child. \"(With the Toy Library), my youngest especially, who is six, would venture around the space on her own and be interested to find out more about how different toys work,\" she said. Another parent who frequents the library, Ms Juliana Rasid, 40, agreed that the Toy Library is a great way to introduce her one-year-old son and five-year-old daughter to the library environment of books and reading. \"It is a pre-activity before we move onto books as my children love to play with toys... But there is also a social element to it as they get to interact and play with other children while learning patience,\" she said. Ms Juliana said that her family does not have the habit of buying toys for the children as they might not always be a hit with her children. With the variety of toys available at the Toy Library, however, she is able to observe what interests them most. SHARING AND CARING FOR A FREE RESOURCE Considering that the toys at the Toy Library are free for all to use, parents said the library also helps to teach the kids about sharing a public good and caring for these toys as if they were their own. Mr Andrew Tan, 42, a stay-at-home dad who visits the place twice weekly, said he began seeing a positive change in two daughters' behaviour when it came to sharing toys. Watching his eight-year-old daughter pull out a princess outfit from a rack of costumes at the Toy Library to dress her four-year-old sister, Mr Tan said with a smile: \"They love to share now, because now they know that there are other children who would want to play with the toys and they learn how to give the toys to the younger children.\" On top of that, they have also come to appreciate that toys are valuable as they cost money to buy, and thus toys that are shared among many children at the library deserve to be treated with care. Said Mr Tan: \"They learned that they don't have to buy toys (for themselves), because there are places where they can share toys (instead).\" He also hopes for the concept to be implemented in more libraries in the future so as to benefit more children by teaching them values and instilling some discipline at a young age. Though she hopes to see more music-related offerings at the Toy Library, Ms Stephanie Chang, 36, has found the Toy Library to be a great space to explore with her 22-month-old son. \"We are from the UK where libraries host free playgroups for children with toys to play with, but since being in Singapore, we have not found anything like that which is free,\" said Ms Chang. Since visiting the Toy Library, she has noticed that the space provided a great way to reduce wastage of toys and her son is able to try out different toys at different developmental stages without having to clutter the home. \"He certainly loves the space and I find that we can stay longer in the library as we alternate between the books section and the Toy Library,\" said Ms Chang.

MAINTAINED BY SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS In order to keep the Toys Library in good shape for visitors, students from Minds Fernvale Gardens School also take on work attachment opportunities at NLB to help maintain the library. The school is dedicated to persons with disabilities, aged seven to 18, to stay engage through programmes and learning experiences to develop critical skills while nurturing their interests and talents. The idea was first conceived back in March 2020 to make Punggol Regional Library accessible to persons with disabilities. Currently, four students undergo the work exposure programme, which takes place weekly between the school's second and fourth terms, every year. During school holidays, NLB would take over the maintenance of the Toy Library. Said the school's vice-principal Evelyn Soh: \"Through this work attachment at Punggol Regional Library, we hope that our students can learn and gain work readiness skills as well as soft skills like time-management to complete assigned tasks independently. \"We also hope that they will pick up independent living skills such as travelling home from the library and finding solutions to the obstacles that they encounter at work.\" Besides sanitising the toys and maintaining the general cleanliness and tidiness of the toy library, the Minds students also attend to visitors' queries and are trained to approach the library staff for assistance when they are unable to answer the queries. Since the work attachment began, Ms Soh said that she has observed positive changes in her students as they become more independent in managing themselves, including reporting to work on time. The students also learned to show care and concern to their peers, look out for one another and offer help when needed. \"Through this collaboration, we hope that the community can better appreciate that persons with intellectual disabilities have the propensity to learn, and with the right support and opportunity, they too can be valued contributors to society,\" said Ms Soh.

It made me happier and more productive — sort of SINGAPORE — There is an abundance of academic studies that link excessive smartphone usage with health and psychological problems. Nurjannah Suhaimi/TODAY New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. In a bid to \"digitally detox\", TODAY's journalist decided to go cold turkey for a week on all things that made his smartphone smart An addictions specialist said that going cold turkey may prompt an immediate change in removing one's addictive behaviours However, managing the withdrawals can be a big barrier The journalist found new pockets of time for \"productive\" tasks, but could not get quick fixes for moments that involved difficult emotions He also encountered many inconveniences since mobile phones are part and parcel of modern life By Renald Loh By Renald Loh Published June 10, 2024 Updated June 10, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — There is an abundance of academic studies that link excessive smartphone usage with health and psychological problems. One 2023 study by University of Queensland researchers that I saw online found that more frequent smartphone use resulted in more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and poor sleeping quality, though I reckon one doesn't have to look very far to see examples of this among friends and acquaintances. I’m not sure if the average of four hours a day I spend on my phone counts as excessive or problematic — the daily average for Singaporeans clocks in at 4.51 hours daily — but the prospect of potentially improving my mental well-being through less phone-time sounds appealing to me. I’ve always romanticised the idea of living in a bygone, less tech-reliant era, where we don’t rush to our devices whenever a notification beckons. So, when the idea of a “digital detox” was first floated by my colleagues, naturally, I put my name in the hat. Last week, my colleague wrote an article detailing his unsuccessful attempt at “dopamine fasting” , though he somehow ended up spending even more time on his phone and on social media, when the goal was the exact opposite. I decided I wasn’t going to fall into the same traps he did. The rules I set myself were simple: For a week, I would go completely cold turkey on all forms of social media and leave my phone untouched as much as possible. My iPhone 14 would be used the same way I would use an old-school Nokia — text and call only. Smartphone? No, just phone. WHY GO COLD TURKEY? Well, why not? Last week, an expert who spoke to my colleague suggested against going cold turkey, recommending instead that having a schedule would be more useful to wean oneself from digital devices. I didn't want to doom my mission before it started, so I sought another expert for more answers. Mr Ganesh, who goes by one name and is a senior counsellor at Viriya Community Services who has a specialist interest in addictions, told me that going cold turkey may prompt an immediate change in removing one's addictive behaviours. However, the efficacy of the cold turkey as an intervention method largely depends on an individual's circumstances. \"Severe substance abuse, for example, may likely result in significant disruption to overall functioning. Hence, it may be more detrimental in the short-term to introduce a sudden stop without professional assessment,\" he added. The ability to sustain the cold turkey treatment and manage its resulting withdrawals is another big obstacle. Indeed, friends of mine who have successfully quit smoking have told me that while going cold turkey was the most effective tactic for breaking the habit, they experienced rather \"painful\" periods of nicotine withdrawal. To combat this, Mr Ganesh pointed to research showing that the presence of \"positive social support\" helps with addiction recovery and reducing the risk of relapse. So, to improve my chances of making it out of my digital detox successfully, I garnered the endorsement of some friends and family for my cold turkey plan and embarked on my mission. Did going cold turkey on social media and superfluous phone use make me happier and more productive? Well, sort of. RECLAIMING PRECIOUS ‘ME’ TIME On the first night of the experiment, I decided I would take a stroll down to my neighbourhood coffee shop, phone-less, to order a bowl of bak chor mee (minced pork noodles) for dinner. I was excited to finally be \"untethered\", and somewhat nostalgic of the times I used to attend primary school as a kid, unencumbered by the burden of the world in my palms. That excitement merely lasted the duration it took me to walk from my door to the lift. I had never been so afraid of the elevator breaking down, or perhaps a family emergency occurring the minute I decided to partake in this silly experiment, where I would be completely unreachable. Thankfully, nothing of that sort happened. Then, as I sat in a corner of the busy eatery waiting for my order, I grew increasingly uneasy — fiddling my thumbs and scanning my surroundings like a restless child. A tangible itch started to surface between my temples that I tried hard not to scratch. I studied every item on the large menu hung above the counter. Then I emptied the contents of my wallet and read the front and back of every card I owned. Then I counted the strands of hair I had above my knees. More than my stomach, my mind was starving to occupy itself with something. No doubt, I knew that if I had my phone with me, I wouldn't pay the slightest attention to my surroundings until my buzzer for my food rang. I would continue to feel instances of this discomfort over the course of the week. However, overall, I found that my self-imposed phone restrictions were a net positive. On days that I didn’t have work, the inability to scroll mindlessly on online forum Reddit or watch YouTube videos meant that I often found myself standing in the middle of my room wondering what to do with my sorry self. Forced to find a way to kill time, I was suddenly able do the things I always said I didn’t have time to do. I managed to read several books that were gathering dust on the shelf, complete some unnecessarily complex jigsaw puzzles I found lying around, and reorganise my mess of a room more times than I can count. When I did reach for my phone, it was a purpose-driven task to text or call the person I intended to, without inadvertently finding myself in the midst of my 50th YouTube Short an hour later, wondering how I got there. This sense of accomplishment for being “productive” outside of work brought me a wave of happiness each time. However, it also meant that there were no quick fixes for the moments in which I had to deal with difficult emotions. These were the toughest parts of my week-long experiment. When I got stressed or annoyed, all I wanted was for a stand-up comedian to make me laugh, a conspiracy theory to make my mind wander, or a cheesy rom-com compilation to make me tear. Essentially, I was looking to replace whatever negativity was within me with a quick dose of another, more pleasant emotion. I wouldn’t consider the experience of having to sit there with my thoughts pleasant in the slightest. Instead of distracting myself with the phone, I now had to confront my feelings head-on and acknowledge that they are there. Doing that and opening up to people I am close to is a much healthier approach than suppressing my feelings, I reckon. Indeed, clinical psychologist Maximillian Chen of Annabelle Psychology told me that using social media to distract from unpleasant emotions only brings about short-term relief. It leaves the root causes of unpleasant emotions unresolved and can potentially lead to poorer mental health in the long run. Having open conversations with people you trust can help you better organise your thoughts and may bring about a more lasting resolution to the unpleasant emotions, he said. I'm glad that was the option I chose. STUBBORNNESS AND INCONVENIENCE What I did not expect from this experiment was how my daily dependence on my phone for all other practical purposes, beyond just browsing on YouTube or social media, added to my frustrations. My efforts to leave my phone untouched as much as possible felt increasingly futile over the course of the week as well. When I was unable to connect my laptop to Wi-Fi networks outside, I required my phone to provide a hot spot to do work. When a family member suddenly complained of intense abdominal pains, I jumped to Google to find out what the problem might be. Forgetting to take along cash, I needed my Wallet application to pay for public transport. When I had to drive a relative to the hospital urgently, I used Google Maps to guide me there. At every instance where I reluctantly turned to my smartphone for help, I felt as though I had let myself down. Am I a slave to Big Tech after all? Am I not committed enough to this “digital detox”? I spent a good portion of the week chiding myself for these supposed failures, but upon some reflection, I realised I shouldn’t have. I wasn’t upset at having to use technology per se. I was annoyed at breaking my own rules. In most of these instances, having technology at my fingertips was beneficial to me in helping me navigate life’s unexpected problems and inconveniences. The problem was the cold turkey. Mr Chen of Annabelle Psychology had called it: While going cold turkey on my smartphone usage reduced its harms, it also reduced its benefits. I could use physical Ez-Link cards, have some cash with me and carry road maps around, but does that make me cultured or just stubborn against change? To completely remove oneself from using smartphones is, in my view, pointless given the society in which we live. Modern life in Singapore very much favours the digitally connected native (especially when restaurants stubbornly insist the only way to order food is by scanning a darned QR code). On the other hand, equally counterproductive is allowing the addictive nature of social media to sweep you into the deep ocean of doom scrolling just so you won’t have to confront the hard things in life. Perhaps there is another way. Another colleague of mine also tried her own digital detox — with rules that are a lot more reasonable than mine. I can’t help but think a more balanced approach like hers would be more effective and less frustrating. So watch this space next week for her account of how that went. In a book I read about digital minimalism by Cal Newport earlier on, he explained that the purpose of undergoing a digital detox such as this is to escape a state where “passive interactions with your screens is passive leisure”. My brief but semi-successful abstinence from social media did open up new pockets of time that weren’t previously there to do things I previously wouldn’t have done. I should give myself a pat on the back for that.

It is not surprising since he hails from a family of MMA fighters, all of whom are highly respected in the community. Adrian's oldest sister, Angela , was the youngest MMA world champion in history when she won the One Championship women's atomweight world title at the age of 19 in May 2016. As for Victoria, she was dubbed a prodigy, who held a 3-0 record before taking her own life on Boxing Day in December 2022. She was 18. Victoria's death was the turning point of Angela's career, as the older sister, now 27, retired last September to focus on mental health advocacy. Both sisters had fought at One Championship events alongside their brother Christian, also a world champion, representing Singapore and the United States. And now Adrian, 18, is ready. Having trained under Christian, 25, he is the first Lee sibling to fight in the ring again after Victoria’s demise. Adrian made his debut at the One Championship in Bangkok, Thailand, on June 8, defeating fellow newcomer Antonio Mammarella via a rear naked choke. “I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life. I’m so happy I got my turn,” Adrian said to commentator Mitch Chilson after the fight. Watching his grit and determination in the octagon, it was hard to imagine that this was the same boy I had spoken to in a virtual interview just a few days before. On camera, he was slightly sheepish, doing his best to tell his story. I was anxious, too. With tough questions to ask, I didn’t know how he would react, especially those related to his sisters. Yet, Adrian remained cool and positive, smiling as he described what it was like to follow in his siblings' footsteps. \"It's been amazing. I'm so blessed and lucky to be born into a family full of accomplished athletes. I've seen step-by-step what it takes to get to the top, and I'm excited to start my journey.\" He acknowledged feeling the pressure of being the youngest fighter in the family, but much of this is due to his own high standards and expectations. “One expectation I have is that I’ll always finish all my fights, either by knockouts, TKOs (technical knockouts), or submissions. I don’t plan to leave the decision to the judges,” he said confidently. “And so far, I’ve had great success doing that.” Before his One Championship debut, Adrian's credentials were already impressive. He was a four-time national youth MMA champion and he had also won the Pankration World title at a wrestling event in Hawaii. ON LOSING VICTORIA It is dizzying just looking at all that Adrian has accomplished at his tender age — he first started training at the age of three and was competing in competitions at four. However, I had to ask him about how he dealt with loss, especially one that shook not only his family, but also the world. My heart pounded as I brought up Victoria, who was undefeated in her career. She made her debut at 16 at a One Championship event at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in 2021 and dominated all three fights that year. She was so young when she lost her life, the same age Adrian is now. I wanted to know how he coped with the tragedy almost two years ago, and what helped him stay focused and motivated in his own journey. Adrian’s replies were brief and polished: “I stay motivated and focused by staying in the gym. As long as I’m training, there are no other thoughts.” He continued: “My sister Victoria has inspired me in all (aspects) of life, and she’ll continue to walk by my side throughout my journey.” I could sense Adrian was putting up a brave front, but just a tinge of hesitance gave it away. I quickly apologised to him if my questions made him uncomfortable, but he was cordial about it and told me that it was okay. Then, when I asked for more personal anecdotes on how Victoria had inspired him, he said: “I’m sorry. Can we skip it?” I readily obliged.

ON ANGELA’S RETIREMENT His response was not entirely unexpected, considering the profound impact of Victoria’s death on the family. The Lee family later closed their United MMA gym in Hawaii. It was a decision made by their father, Mr Ken Lee, a Singaporean martial artist who holds black belts in Brazilian jiu-jitsu , pankration and taekwondo. In September 2023, Angela revealed in an online article for The Players' Tribune website that she herself had attempted suicide in 2017, a period marked by immense pressure and expectations as well as personal challenges . The website features athletes writing stories or letters in first-person and Angela's article was titled Resilient. She wrote then that she got to a point where she had pushed her mind and body too far, and her car crash in November 2017 was not an accident. Highlighting the often-hidden struggles faced by some individuals, even those who appear strong and successful, Angela encouraged people to seek help and not to suffer in silence, stressing that mental illness can affect anyone. After retiring, Angela established Fightstory, a non-profit mental health charity, in Victoria’s honour, advocating for mental wellness in the global fight community. Adrian said that Angela is no longer involved in MMA. “I think it's great that my sister has started a new path with Fightstory and wants to encourage others to open up about mental health.” The family's gym has also reopened as Prodigy Training Centre, where Adrian trains for his fights. In the last eight months, his preparation work intensified from his usual training to set the stage for his debut. He had three training sessions almost every day, each session lasting about two to three hours. Adrian said that he maintains his mental wellness by staying focused in the gym. “I put all my focus into MMA because I love it. It’s familiar to me, and it’s my lifestyle.” He feels fortunate to have made his debut under the guidance of his brother Christian, who keeps him disciplined and on track. Christian now holds both the One lightweight and welterweight world titles, and was the youngest male world champion in One Championship history, achieving this milestone at 20. Adrian said: “One piece of advice he's given me that I’ll always remember is to stay focused on the game plan because there are going to be a lot of things that come with MMA, such as media and photoshoots. “I just have to remember what I came here to do, and that’s to fight.” LOOKING FORWARD So, what’s next for Adrian? He told me that after beating Mammarella, he aspires to become a lightweight and welterweight champion, just like his brother. Adrian’s parents are throwing their support behind their youngest, too, constantly checking in on him to ensure that he is mentally and physically sound. “They support me by buying healthy groceries, which helps keep my weight in check. Sticking to a healthy diet may be difficult at the start, but it’s now very easy for me to stay disciplined.” To get a better idea of what an 18-year-old aspiring world champion’s diet looks like, here’s what Adrian has been eating since he was 15: Various sources of protein, vegetables and grains, and nothing fried and processed. Still, he enjoys digging into carbs, such as pizza and French baguette, on his \"cheat\" days. “Usually, I’ll allow myself to eat whatever I want on those days, then when I get back to my healthy diet, I stick to it.” He is clear about his goals and pursues them with unwavering dedication. In his shoes, I doubt I would have the same level of determination. To young, aspiring fighters who dream of a career in MMA, Adrian offers this advice: “As long as you have the heart, motivation and the will to win, you’ll be able to achieve your dreams and goals in MMA.” Related topics MMA Angela Lee Victoria Lee One Championship Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-lkTWjljjEd4')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-eDK231pRdZA')); Trending Content is loading...

Spinal muscular atrophy is a genetic disorder characterised by the loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy It is a rare disease in Singapore but has recently made headlines when at least four families needed to raise more than S$1 million each for a drug The drug Zolgensma helps their children to live closer to \"normal\" lives, one parent said Ms Sherry Toh, who has the disease, has been fundraising for more than a year and unable to meet her target to fund her costly medication Patients may receive some financial respite soon with the Medication Assistance Fund By Nicole Lam By Nicole Lam Published June 15, 2024 Updated June 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Drinking a glass of water is an act that most people do not give a second thought to, but for 25-year-old Sherry Toh, it is a task that takes her exactly 52 seconds to complete. Since she was diagnosed with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) as an infant at 13 months old, she has struggled with even the simplest tasks because the congenital neuromuscular disorder, which is characterised by the loss of motor neurons, leads to muscle weakness and atrophy. Most patients are unable to stand or sit unsupported, and as the disease worsens, they have problems swallowing, speaking and breathing. Ms Toh, who spends most of her time on the sofa, needs cushions to prop up her head and back. She found some respite recently through the drug Evrysdi. Apart from no longer being out of breath when speaking or getting through daily tasks such as typing, she took just 16 seconds to finish that cup of water — almost the same speed as an average adult. This marked improvement in her condition, however, was short-lived. When her crowdfunding campaign to pay for the costly drug did not hit its target of S$375,000 to pay for a year’s supply, the drug’s manufacturer Roche donated a three-month supply to her in May last year. She took her last dose of the drug in September last year. “I’m very out of breath when I drink water now,” she said of one of her many struggles. Her crowdfunding campaign is still up more than a year later but has raised just S$89,425 — 23 per cent of her goal. Her doctor can only prescribe her the drug when she can pay for at least half a year’s supply of the drug. Research has shown that patients only show improvement after six months of taking the drug. Ms Toh said that she does not want whatever money she has raised to go to waste and if she does not meet the target, she will donate it to another SMA patient. SMA is a rare disease with 40 to 50 people suffering from it here. The condition made headlines in the last few years due to several crowdfunding campaigns to bring in Zolgensma — one of the world’s most expensive drugs — to help at least four babies diagnosed with the condition. There is no cure, but there are treatments that can improve patients’ quality of life and the Health Sciences Authority now approves the use of Spinraza, Evrysdi , and the gene therapy Zolgensma, although these drugs are not subsidised. Zolgensma, which was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2019, is a one-time therapy that must be administered before the patient turns two years old. In Singapore, it costs S$2.4 million and must be paid up in full before administration. Prices vary globally, generally around S$2.7 million to S$2.8 million in the US and Europe , but in Australia, the treatment is fully covered under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For Evrysdi, an oral medication taken daily to increase the production of a protein that SMA patients lack, it costs about S$375,000 for a year's supply. Spinraza, which needs to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid and requires a hospital stay, costs between S$845,480 and S$1.1 million for four injections in the first year and then S$507,000 for three doses in subsequent years. There is some hope for sufferers, though, with the Agency for Care Effectiveness on June 4 recommending that the Medication Assistance Fund subsidise drugs such as Evrysdi from Aug 1. The agency, which was set up by the Ministry of Health (MOH), is the national health technology assessment and clinical guidance agency. Following the agency's recommendations, MOH will review the matter. TODAY has reached out to the ministry to find out whether Evrysdi will be subsidised from August. Until that happens, Ms Toh wants to continue finding ways to fund her medication, adding that she has “many dreams she wants to accomplish.” Recently, her work as a video games journalist earned her a coveted spot at the Game Awards’ Future Class programme last year, which recognises leaders in the video game industry. Those selected will have opportunities for networking, career development and will get to attend workshops and panels. The programme picks just 50 applicants out of thousands every year, and Ms Toh is the sole Singaporean participant this year. She hopes to work in video game development and create a game that can help others feel like they are seen for more than their disabilities. “There are still options. There is hope and a way to stall the progression of your disability, and even to reverse some of the effects, you still have options. There are still things to do and live for,\" she said. Even though she is relieved that families with babies who have SMA were able to receive the donations they needed, Ms Toh feels “left behind”. “I don’t know if it’s that people just haven’t heard my story or if it’s got something to do with the fact that babies are cuter,” she said of the inability to raise money for her condition. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Ms Sherry Toh in her home on May 21, 2024. LIFE AFTER FUNDRAISING FOR THE ‘MIRACLE DRUG’ Even though fundraising was a “nerve-racking” experience, parents of children with SMA told TODAY that seeing how well their children have responded to these expensive medications made it worth their while. The treatment is not a cure for the condition, but it has given patients a better quality of life, allowing them to lead a close to “normal” life. For example, before receiving the gene therapy, Ms Shuwen Devaraj's son Devdan, who was diagnosed with Type 2 SMA at seven months old, found it difficult to feed himself, she said. He had to constantly lower his head to his spoon since he did not have enough strength in his arms to lift the spoon to his mouth and had hand tremors. Ms Devaraj said that five-year-old Devdan is now “getting really strong”. From not being able to lift the spoon to his mouth, he can now wheel himself around in a wheelchair. “He’s growing up like a normal child; he’s just weak in walking, but he has gained some independence,” she added. She remembered the trepidation she felt after doctors from National University Hospital told her it would cost S$2.9 million for him to get Zolgensma. This amount seemed staggering for the interior designer and her civil service husband, both 36, to come up with on their own. She had heard of other fundraising bids that did not raise enough money or were met with scepticism by the public where some donors insisted on getting their donations back. Still, she knew that she had to try because Zolgensma had been dubbed the “miracle drug” for young patients of SMA. She contacted the online fundraising platform Ray of Hope as a last-ditch effort because Devdan was already nearing his second birthday. “I probably didn’t sleep for those ten days,” Ms Devara said. “I didn’t know there were so many kind people in this world. I think it has changed me and changed my life.” After a crowdfunding campaign that raised S$2.87 million in 10 days, Devdan received Zolgensma in September 2021. While the boy will not require any long-term medication, he attends physiotherapy sessions at a private clinic, which costs about S$240 an hour. During the first two years of receiving Zolgensma, Devdan attended these sessions a few times a week to build his strength. His parents said that they had to reduce their household expenses to pay for his physiotherapy sessions. Shuwen Devaraj Five-year-old Devdan Devaraj (pictured) was diagnosed with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy at seven months old. EVERY IMPROVEMENT A CELEBRATION Data centre specialist Nabeel Abdat, 32, and homemaker Syahirah Yakub, 33, similarly had to raise money for their son Zayn to receive Zolgensma. Zayn was diagnosed with SMA Type 1 , the most severe form of the disorder, when he was barely a month old​​​​. “It was a tough journey because we started in mid-August (in 2022), and we only got the funds about October, and the medication only came in about late November that year,” Mr Nabeel said. “Every day was nerve-racking because we explored every possible means to get the word out there.\" The couple’s donations plateaued at around S$1.5 million, leading them to make posters to place at churches, temples and mosques. “We were very desperate,” Ms Syahirah said, adding that at the time, they were overextending on their credit cards to pay S$15,000 for a bottle of Evrysdi because Zayn’s condition deteriorated while they were fundraising. “We were just thinking, what would happen if this were to happen to someone who just doesn’t have that kind of money?” Ms Syahirah asked. “It’s quite critical. Every minute is ticking, so we need the drugs as soon as possible.” Ms Syahirah suggested that if there was some kind of government subsidy, it would not leave parents in this situation “hanging”. “The doctor predicted that Zayn can’t even sit on his own and only make minimal movements. But now, he can sit on his own for five minutes and he’s also learning how to walk and stand on his own.” Raj Nadarajan/TODAY Two-year-old Zayn Nabeel Abdat, who has Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy, with his father Nabeel Abdat and mother Syahirah Yakub in their home on June 12, 2024. These improvements have renewed hope in Mr Nabeel and Ms Syahirah that their son may lead a more independent life that many children who have SMA Type 1 without treatment might not be able to do. They are looking forward to one day taking him overseas for a holiday. “At this stage, Zayn is like in between a Type 1 and Type 2 (for SMA) because he’s able to sit down where most type 1 patients are not able to,” Mr Nabeel said. “We’re not expecting him to run, but at least when he’s in the wheelchair, he can still stand up and have a few walks to maybe go to the toilet, that kind of thing.” With Zolgensma, his breathing has also improved — Zayn can now spend about 90 minutes off his ventilator a couple of times each day, compared to being on the ventilator constantly. “It’s like a small celebration for us,” Ms Syahirah said.

Collagen-infused food and drinks are often marketed as being a beauty supplement that is good for the skin Medically, there is no guarantee that orally ingested collagen will enhance the skin’s condition Experts gave their take on how worthwhile collagen supplements are They also offer advice on how to maintain skin health By Rachel Fong By Rachel Fong Published June 15, 2024 Updated June 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Behold the marketing claims that say collagen broth or the “beauty hot pot” will give a youthful glow to your face and prevent wrinkles or the loss of elasticity to your skin. No matter how enticing it is, as a consumer, you need to know the science behind how it works, so that you understand what happens as you watch that translucent jelly-like collagen melt in the pot or swirl in your bubble tea. Collagen-infused food items continue to flood the market here — from personalities putting their names behind collagen soup mixes to hawkers selling collagen porridge or food prepared in collagen gravy, and stores stocking collagen broth in frozen packs and even collagen \"hot pot\" instant noodles. A nutritionist, dietician and an aesthetic doctor explained how collagen really works, what to look out for as buyers, and gave tips on what else you can do to improve your skincare. WHAT IS COLLAGEN Collagen is a type of protein that the human body produces naturally using amino acids from protein-rich or collagen-rich food such as bone broth, fish and meat. It makes up 65 per cent of the total protein found in the body. As the largest protein, collagen is a chain of more than 1,500 amino acids. It is found in skin, hair, nails, tendons, cartilage and bones. Collagen works with other substances to maintain skin elasticity, volume and moisture. It also helps make up proteins such as keratin that form skin, hair and nails. Dr Edwin Lim, medical director of Edwin Lim Medical Aesthetic Clinic, said: “Additionally, collagen supports the function of fibroblasts, which promote continuous regeneration and repair of the skin.” However, the rate at which the body produces collagen naturally starts decreasing when individuals reach their mid-20s and this accelerates over time. Aside from the ageing factor, sun damage, smoking and alcohol and sugar consumption all decrease collagen production, leading to thinner and weaker skin. Ms Jaclyn Reutens, clinical and sports dietitian with Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants, said that genetics, too, can influence the collagen synthesis rate, just as how they influence the amount of melanin (hair, eye and skin pigmentation) every person has. Genetics also determine how much elastin and keratin the body produces. WILL COLLAGEN IN FOOD AND DRINKS REPLENISH WHAT IS LOST? The answer to this is: No, the collagen found in food and drinks will not help to increase collagen production. The science is simply this: The human body cannot absorb collagen in its whole form to replenish the collagen lost. The molecules are too big to directly enter the bloodstream or the skin. When it enters the stomach, collagen gets broken down into peptides during digestion, which are short chains of amino acids. Once it is broken down, there is no control over and no knowing how much of it is absorbed. The body will deposit it where it is most needed, which may not be the skin but in muscles, bones, tendons or cartilages. Singapore-accredited nutritionist Adlyn Farizah said that the amino acids can also be found in many other protein-rich foods, not only from collagen-infused foods. In other words, your everyday food such as meat, poultry and seafood have just as much to offer in terms of protein intake to help your body make collagen. And you are paying for soup or bubble tea that may be adding more sodium or sugar into your body. ARE COLLAGEN SUPPLEMENTS WORTH TAKING? As for collagen supplements, there are still no large-scale studies to prove they work. Doctors Payal Patel and Maryanne Makredes Senna wrote in an article on Harvard Health Publishing’s website under the Harvard Medical School that no human studies have clearly proven that collagen taken orally will end up in the skin and hair. What exists are some trials regarding the use of such supplements. Most of the studies on the benefits of collagen supplements and skin health are small-scale trials done by companies that manufacture the collagen products themselves, Ms Adlyn the nutritionist said. Ms Reutens the dietitian said that these supplements typically contain a hydrolysed form of collagen, which means that it has been broken down into smaller peptides to ensure more of it gets absorbed into the body. There are keywords that consumers can look out for in the packaging's ingredients list to discern whether a collagen supplement is more likely to work as advertised, Ms Reutens added. They include collagen peptides, marine collagen, and hydrolysed collagen on the packaging, rather than simply “collagen”. Terms such as hydrolysed marine collagen peptides, in particular, are considered a superior form of collagen compared to bovine-sourced collagen or collagen derived from cows. However, people allergic to fish and shellfish should not consume marine collagen. Look out also for prolyl-hydroxyproline and hydroxyprolyl-glycine — two peptides that have undergone more research and been proven to improve elasticity, texture and wrinkles. These supplements also usually contain ingredients such as vitamins A and C, zinc, antioxidants, and hyaluronic acid that are equally beneficial to skin. That said, individuals who suffer from kidney and liver problems should be mindful of their protein intake. Ms Reutens also recommended steering clear of products with fillers such as iron oxide, mineral oil, and carrageenan. Pexels Collagen derived from fish (left) and from cows (right) sold as oral supplements. Ultimately, more research is still needed to determine collagen’s actual impact in these results. Another aspect that requires further research is the safety of consumption and the potential long-term effects. One of the reasons for this is that the quality and sources of collagen supplements can vary significantly. Dr Lim from the aesthetic clinic warned: “Some supplements may contain additives or contaminants that could pose health risks.” Unlike medicine, supplements do not require approval and are not evaluated by the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore before they can be sold here. This may mean that the purity and content of such products vary. Similarly, there are no guidelines from the Singapore Food Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration for a food or drink product to be defined as containing collagen, Ms Reutens said. Furthermore, there are no established upper safety limits of collagen, though some studies have suggested that the recommended amount to take for effectiveness is between 2.5g and 15g daily. Consumers are therefore strongly encouraged to exercise due diligence when buying or taking collagen supplements. HOW TO STIMULATE COLLAGEN PRODUCTION So without oral ingestion of collagen, you are better off sticking to the tried-and-tested methods of caring for your skin. When choosing skincare products that help to stimulate collagen production, Dr Lim suggested picking those that contain ingredients such as retinol and vitamin C, which are more likely to yield visible results. Retinol is a derivative of vitamin A, and promotes cell turnover as well as collagen synthesis. With consistent use, it can reduce wrinkles and improve skin texture. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that works to protect the skin against environmental damage and support collagen formation. Like any other skincare product, it is worth noting that their effectiveness can be influenced by factors such as one’s skin type, the product’s formula, and the concentration of active ingredients. Dr Lim also said that there are a number of treatments that can directly stimulate collagen production in the dermis (middle layer of the skin). One of them is high-intensity focused ultrasound, which uses ultrasound energy to heat the layers of the skin. Others include the CO2 fractional laser and microneedling, both of which create controlled micro-injuries in the skin to trigger the body’s natural healing response, leading to a boost in collagen production. CO2 fractional laser is also taken up by people looking to heal acne scars. Due to the direct nature of these treatments, they can provide more visible results compared to supplements and topical products, Dr Lim said. The results tend to last longer because they are able to target the deeper skin layers. FOOD AND LIFESTYLE HABITS THAT PROMOTE COLLAGEN PRODUCTION Although a decrease in natural collagen production rate is a natural part of ageing, there are still plenty of natural food items and lifestyle habits that can help to maintain skin health. Protein-rich food such as meat, poultry and seafood can help boost collagen levels and these food groups are rich in collagen themselves as well, especially in parts such as the bones, joints and skin, Ms Adlyn the nutritionist said For vegetarians, they can achieve the same effect with egg whites, dairy products, cabbage and legumes such as beans and peas For vegans, besides vegetables like cabbage and cucumbers and legumes, there are also soy products and beancurd. These foods are high in proline, which is one of the amino acids needed for collagen production Food types containing the following nutrients can also support collagen synthesis: Vitamins C and E, zinc and copper Vitamin C can be found in a variety of citrus fruits, bell peppers, and berries, while vitamin E is present in nuts, seeds and avocados Zinc can be found in meat, shellfish, eggs, and whole grains, and copper can come from nuts, shellfish and leafy greens In terms of lifestyle habits: Minimising exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun and applying sunscreen regularly can go a long way towards maintaining one’s collagen production rate. UV rays contain free radicals that can damage the skin barrier and accelerate skin ageing as well Cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol not only degrade collagen, but also decrease the body’s production of it Making sure that your diet is low in sugar and refined carbohydrates (pastries, white rice, white bread) will help Excessive sugar intake can lead to a process called glycation, where sugar molecules bind to proteins such as collagen molecules and damage them To go one step further in supporting skin health, consider other types of supplements beyond collagen-based ones, Ms Reutens suggested. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties that can reduce skin damage and lower one’s risk of skin cancer, she added. Biotin, a B vitamin, is beneficial for not only skin health, but hair and nails as well. You may also take a vitamin C supplement if you are not getting enough amounts from your diet. Now that you are educated about collagen, the next thing to do is to inform those who are not as discerning. As an informed consumer, you should have the mind to keep to common-sense health habits that will also help you make some savings: Pay less for the rich collagen hot pot, stop smoking cigarettes, reduce alcohol intake, and have a well-balanced diet. For a well-balanced meal, Ms Adlyn the nutritionist recommended following the Health Promotion Board’s My Healthy Plate guide. This would mean filling one’s plate with: Wholegrains (one quarter of the plate) Protein (one quarter of the plate) Fruits and vegetables (half of the plate) If you must consume alcohol, keep to two drinks or fewer daily for men or one drink or fewer daily for women. If you have any pressing concerns about your skin or hair conditions, talk to your doctor or a dermatologist for advice.

We find out what motivates them to be better dads every day. By Renald Loh By Renald Loh Published June 16, 2024 Updated June 19, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Barely five months after he was born with cerebral palsy in 1964, Mr Alan Pek was placed in the care of a foster family because his biological parents had decided that they did not want to raise him. His condition meant that he took much longer to walk and speak than his peers. He had to be piggybacked to school until he was in kindergarten. He underwent session after session of speech therapy as a child. You could say that it was a life destined to be difficult. Yet, fast forward nearly six decades and Mr Pek, 60, was speaking to TODAY articulately, animatedly, unabashedly — now an assistant vice-president of a major international bank, a graduate of a university in the United Kingdom and a proud father of two. “The only thing I give up on is ‘giving up’ itself,” he said with his trademark grin in his cosy four-room flat in Jurong West. Mr Pek’s smile was at all times wide and infectious. Then, when he spoke about his children, he beamed. His older daughter is 22 years old and a final-year student at the Laselle College of the Arts. His younger daughter, 18-year-old Pek Ling Fei, studies at the Lee Kong Chian Gardens School at Movement of the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds), and is neurodivergent . Early in her life, Miss Pek Ling Fei was diagnosed with an intellectual disability known as global developmental delay. Due to her condition, she has a limited vocabulary and often feels overstimulated in crowded places with loud noises, at times triggering meltdowns where she cries uncontrollably in public. She also tends to get anxious in the presence of strangers, but she was comfortable being herself in the presence of her dad’s guests on this day. As the interview was done at the coffee table and Mr Pek was talking about the many obstacles he has had to face growing up with cerebral palsy, his younger girl broke into dance a stone’s throw away in the living room. He turned his gaze towards her and gushed with pride: “She’s incredible.” In all his years of being a father, with all its highs and lows, Mr Pek said that he has learnt to “embrace every moment, and (do so) with unconditional empathy”. PERSONS WITH DEDICATION Mr Pek is a man not short of confidence in his own abilities in work and in life. From the variety of experiences that he shared with TODAY over two hours, it was clear that he does not view his cerebral palsy as a debilitating ailment. He asked this reporter what “PWD” stands for, an acronym commonly used for persons with disabilities. When told the answer, he countered: “No. The ‘D’ stands for dedication, determination.” When he sat for his Primary School Leaving Examination decades ago, he had been given an extra 30 minutes to finish his papers. He left the examination hall earlier than his peers and still aced the exam. When he was not allowed to convert his overseas driving licence to one valid for use in Singapore, he dutifully took all his theory tests again and surprised his driving instructors with his abilities on the road. He also encountered a fair share of scepticism from peers when he was hired by Deutsche Bank 27 years ago. He is now a senior member and an integral part of the bank’s global infrastructure team, where over the years, he has had to coordinate projects around the clock. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Mr Alan Pek, 60, posing for a photo at home with his youngest daughter Pek Ling Fei (left at back) and wife Sue Wong Shu Ju (right at back), 51, on June 13, 2024. With a neurodivergent daughter and years of experiencing discrimination for his condition, Mr Pek has done his bit to try to make Singapore society more inclusive, starting at his own firm: He is one of the founding “fathers” of dbEnable, a voluntary group aimed at advocating for the employability of people who are differently abled. The programme includes a work placement offering 10-week internships to neurodivergent students from Singapore’s universities, some of whom secure employment with the bank upon graduation. “Having experienced a lack of support upon joining the bank in 1997, I wanted to create an environment where interns felt welcomed and had someone to turn to.” As a “differently abled person”, he had always felt the need to work twice as hard to prove that he was just as capable as anyone else. And when it comes to parenting, Mr Pek brings that same level of energy and zeal. His wife Sue Wong, 51, an auditor, said: “He’s always very positive… he brings light to our family and he is a very important pillar of our family. “Being parents in Singapore is very stressful, but with what Alan experienced over the course of his life, he shows us that we can do it.” ‘CARE FOR THEM HOW YOU WANT TO BE CARED FOR’ At Minds, the teachers of Mr Pek's younger girl train and nurture her independent living skills, and expose her to various activities that involve music, art and sports, in addition to traditional academics, he said. Still, he believes that parents play the most crucial role in a child’s development. “Children need their fathers more than their fathers realise… I made myself a promise. If one day I become a father, I will not become like my own father.” Although Mr Pek’s foster family provided him with “unwavering love and support”, his biological father had been absent in his adolescence, meeting him only during the annual Chinese New Year festivities later in his life. As Mr Pek prepares to celebrate his 22nd Father’s Day this Sunday (June 16), he told me that he had always wanted to do for his children what his own father did not do for him. Whether it be parent-teacher meetings, award ceremonies or overseas holidays, Mr Pek would not let his responsibilities at work and volunteer organisations stop him from being present at all of his daughters’ important milestones. When asked what his fondest memories are of his daughters, he said without missing a beat: “Every moment is precious.” He added: “My elder girl has grown into a fine young lady, with kindness and righteousness. We are also very open and can discuss anything under the sun. “As for Ling Fei, every accomplishment — from basic tasks like sleeping and dressing independently to moments of joy such as dancing and playing the electric organ — fills me with immense pride. \"Her laughter and comforting hugs are so precious.” Was he ever concerned that his cerebral palsy would be a hindrance to his parenting? “I always believed I could do it. But thinking that you ‘can’ is not enough, you must be willing to do it and put in the effort.” As soon as he said this, like a moth to a flame, his younger daughter hopped over to her father and gently leaned against him, initiating a warm embrace. He appeared surprised by this, but he returned the gesture swiftly. “Love you, love you, love you,” he said to her.

Free football hard courts mostly vacant as noise complaints, hot weather drive users to paid artificial turfs SINGAPORE — Walking by some of the outdoor street football hard courts in housing estates, one cannot help but wonder if they are falling out of favour with recreational football players and the young. Nuria Ling/TODAY A street football court at a public housing estate on North Bridge Road seen on May 6, 2024. New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now.

Hard courts in neighbourhoods for people to play street football are not used as much now compared to at least 10 years ago, some residents observed They reported seeing fewer children playing at these free facilities, saying that numbers dwindled especially after the Covid-19 pandemic The increasingly hot weather and the availability of indoor artificial pitches may also be contributing factors Artificial turf operators and younger players talked about why these paid facilities are appealing By Sufiyan Samsuri By Sufiyan Samsuri Published June 16, 2024 Updated June 16, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Walking by some of the outdoor street football hard courts in housing estates, one cannot help but wonder if they are falling out of favour with recreational football players and the young. Quite a few look like they have seen better days and in need of a spruce-up. Student Lee Kok Jun, 24, who has lived at least two decades in a public housing block located next to a football hard court, observed that in contrast to 10 years ago where people of all ages were using the facility, only a few children are seen playing there now and then these days. On weekdays, it is rare to see anyone using the court near Block 339 Clementi Avenue 5. On weekends, mostly children of primary school-going age would show up to kick around with a ball, Mr Lee said. A check with some residents, players and operators providing alternative pitches showed that there may be some factors contributing to the lack of use. They are: Singapore's hot weather conditions that have only been getting hotter in the past years The demographic profile of residents living near the hard courts Possible noise complaints The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic The unfavourable conditions of the courts The provision of artificial pitches by private operators When TODAY visited the hard court near Mr Lee’s home on Clementi Avenue 5 on a weekday morning, it was empty and the flooring did not seem to be in the best condition. Sufiyan Samsuri A street football court near Block 339 Clementi Avenue 5 on April 29, 2024. Retiree Patanannadan Aspatraja, 73, who lives in the same neighbourhood, agreed with Mr Lee, saying that he normally sees the hard court being used for kickabouts only during the weekends, and occasionally on weekday evenings. “Unless it is a school holiday, generally the usage rate on a weekday is really low,” Mr Aspatraja added. “This could possibly be caused by the noise complaints from the residents. The noise level is normally boisterous when there are people playing and may travel up to high-rise floors.” However, Madam Puteh Ahmad, 72, a housewife who has lived in the same neighbourhood for 45 years, said that there are usually sounds of balls being kicked and bouncing off the surrounding fence, but to her, it was not so bad that they warranted complaints. She noted that the number of people playing at the Clementi court has halved since the recent pandemic, adding that it is now mainly used by children having kickabouts about once a week. When contacted by TODAY, Jurong-Clementi Town Council said that this court has not been fully utilised primarily due to the demographic profile of residents in the area, which comprises mostly middle-aged and older residents. \"Recognising the importance of maintaining functional and safe communal spaces, the town council is committed to refurbishing the soccer court floor. “With the refurbishment, we hope to enhance its appeal and attract more users, fostering social engagement and inter-generational connections,” it added. The town council did not comment further when asked to elaborate on when the low utilisation began, what kind of social and inter-generational activities it is looking at, as well as the frequency and costs of refurbishing the court. At the end of last year, the public use of a hard court was in the news. Some residents in Bedok North approved of a short-term closing of a football hard court not just because of the noise but because of inconsiderate users who dirty the place and occupy it for other purposes. Member of Parliament Tan Kiat How, who is also Senior Minister of State for National Development, said at the time that residents’ profiles change, so their needs may be different and may prefer wanting inter-generational public space for them and their grandchildren. IS COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO BLAME? Over at another hard court in Aljunied Crescent, retail employee Nur Aisyah Afandy, 32, said that there were roughly at least two to three times more people using it about four years ago, before the pandemic struck. Another Aljunied Crescent resident who gave her name as just Mrs Chong, 52, said that the younger generation might have gotten used to staying indoors since the pandemic. This made the young turn more to playing with electronic gadgets , the housewife reckoned. Sufiyan Samsuri A view of a street football court in Aljunied Crescent on May 3, 2024. When contacted, Marine Parade Town Council said that it does not keep any specific data on the use of the five street football courts under its purview — including the one at Aljunied Crescent — since they are open to the public for use without any charge. There are no plans to repurpose any of these courts for other uses. \"In recent years, the town council has also not received any feedback or complaints from residents regarding the use of the street soccer courts in our town,\" it added. In the North Bridge Road area, a resident living close to a hard court said that before the pandemic, there used to be street football competitions held there, but these slowly died down. Ms Suhaily Sohdi, a 47-year-old caregiver to her father and who has been in the estate for around 16 years, added: \"Sometimes, I see preschool teachers taking the school kids out there to play, but it is not for football, just free play or other type of games led by the teachers.” Mr Guntmar Kerbl, 41, who came from Austria and has lived in Singapore since 2001, said that the poor design and choices of material has led to the low usage of the court on North Bridge Road. The semi-retiree and former info-technology professional suggested that artificial grass or outdoor carpeting, instead of poorly painted concrete, would reduce risk of injury and noise. “Ultraviolet-resistant goal netting would last longer, a higher cross bar on the goal would also reduce injury.” Nuria Ling/TODAY Peeling paint and cracks on the floor at a street football court in a public housing estate on North Bridge Road seen on May 6, 2024. When TODAY visited the site, the court had cracked flooring and torn goalpost nets. Mr Kerbl added that from what he had seen in the past, shortly after repair works for the court were done, it would start looking worn out again. Jalan Besar Town Council, which oversees this hard court, has not responded to queries by publication time. THE DRAW OF ARTIFICIAL FOOTBALL PITCHES Separately, the needs of some segments of football enthusiasts are being served elsewhere. The emergence of artificial football pitches by providers has been drawing people who want some form of privacy and exclusivity to play in their own groups. When TODAY visited some artificial football pitches in Kovan on a weekday morning in May, there were two groups of players having a kickabout there. Nuria Ling/TODAY A group of students playing at a sheltered football pitch at Kick Off!, located at Kovan, on May 7, 2024. The eight pitches are managed by futsal venue operator Kick Off!. It charges an hourly rate of S$55 during off-peak hours and S$105 at peak hours. Off-peak hours are weekdays before 6pm. Peak hours include weekends and public holidays. Mr Jubilant Chew, a 22-year-old undergraduate, said that he goes to these \"astro turf\" pitches because they have a more “professional feel”. He has been playing football since he was around six years old, he added, but he has never played at an outdoor street football court before. He now plays with a group of close friends about once a week. “With the (artificial) grass surface, I think the risk of injury is lower as well. I do not mind paying for the additional cost as we are able to split the cost among 10 to 15 players.” He added: “Generally, the football scene in Singapore is becoming quite developed with grassroots football and academies being more accessible, so I think there has been a shift from casual, leisure play to a lot more organised football such as this.” Marketing manager and boxing coach Grace Ke, 33, who plays futsal regularly about two to three times a week, said that street football courts are hard to find and difficult to secure. She stopped playing at such hard courts since secondary school and has since played the sport on paid artificial pitches. “As adults, time is precious and we don’t really have hours to spend waiting around for a court to be empty,” Ms Ke added. For student Dhia Sufi Suhaimi, 19, who has also stopped playing at these hard courts since secondary school, he prefers to play football at artificial pitches to prevent blisters and injuries. “I think the courts are not in good condition and players can potentially injure themselves, especially for younger kids playing.” Another student Daiyan Rizqi, 15, who plays futsal about twice a week, has shifted from playing at hard courts to artificial pitches. \"Playing on an artificial turf allows me to put on my football boots and there is a better feeling due to the softer surface.\" However, he lamented about the high prices of renting such facilities. \"As a teenager, I think the prices of artificial turf are not really affordable, even after splitting it among the players.\" Nuria Ling/TODAY Mr Jubilant Chew playing football at Kick Off!, a sheltered court located in Kovan, on May 7, 2024. Mr Huang Jiaming, 34, director of Kick Off!, told TODAY that the growth of venues providing artificial turfs can be attributed to the advancement in technology. “Although the set-up cost might be higher, but in the long term, it is cheaper as it requires a lot less maintenance. This is why more companies are coming into this business to invest in artificial turf.” Being a fully sheltered facility, Mr Huang said that people would also rather pay money to reduce the risk of calling off a game due to the bad weather, such as when they have to play outdoors at the hard courts. “In terms of safety, as parents, I would definitely want my kid to be playing on the (padded) astro turf as compared to a hard soccer court.” When it comes to safety, investing in the right footwear for football games is important, but that can also mean that parents have to spend more to satiate their children's roving eyes. The range can be mind-boggling with new boots being launched frequently. They run the gamut from those made for soft ground, hard ground and “multi-ground” to those for astro turfs or natural grass pitches. The fit also depends on the role of the player on the pitch, not to mention that the studs and cleats on the soles of boots matter for performance. Mr Huang attributed the power of marketing from big sporting brands such as Nike and Adidas as the main contributing factor causing a shift where younger people prefer paying to play on artificial pitches rather than the open-for-all street football courts. “With children now being exposed more to social media, they see their idols wearing new boot designs and want to emulate them,” Mr Huang said. Mr Rajesh Mulani, 54, director of The Cage, told TODAY that about a quarter of its customers are youth aged 18 or below. The company was set up 19 years ago and now operates 12 pitches in total for 5-a-side games at its Kallang and Dempsey locations. The Cage/Facebook Children playing football at an artificial pitch run by The Cage in the Dempsey Village area. Like Kick Off!, The Cage also offers student-discounted rates, which are around S$69 for a two-hour session during off-peak hours at its Kallang venue, for instance. Mr Mulani said that playing on a good-quality turf offers shock absorption to the joints, helping to reduce injuries for players. He also said that Singapore's heat is \"uncompromising\", so that led him and co-founder Sanjay Danani to design a weather-independent venue to host small-sided games for players. \"We must recognise the impact of our weather on outdoor sports. Heat, rain, lighting — these are real. And it is high time that we, in Singapore, develop our own intelligence in how we design our public spaces to offer sensible shelter systems, which seems to be ignored right now.” Of the 12 residents who spoke to TODAY, 11 said that the street football courts should still be made available to the young. As it is, the likelihood remains that children tend to choose to play ball games close to home at the void decks below housing blocks , even though that is not allowed. Mr Lee the Clementi resident said: “It is good to preserve these hard courts. Not everyone has the privilege to rent astro-turf futsal courts to play. \"Since it is not allowed to play at void decks, street soccer courts give a place for children who likes football to play the sport near their homes.” Related topics football sports Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-GXc8U7hJpWw')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-tnk_S3H129s')); Trending Content is loading...

By Nikki Yeo By Nikki Yeo Published June 16, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — For artist Peter Zhuo, pursuing his artistic dreams and clinching four Guinness World Records has long been about fulfilling a promise to his late grandfather. That promise was to be a great artist one day, to make others smile with his drawings. Now, as a relative latecomer to fatherhood, he is also inspired by his seven-month-old son Oliver — and has even decided to work from home full-time to get maximum time with his boy. He has also offered his six full time employees in the animation studio that produced characters Ai and Aiko the option of working from home. \"I encourage my team to spend their time however they want, on the condition that they continue to meet the key results we all agreed on,\" he said. Mr Zhuo, 39, who also goes by the name Peter Draw, is the creator of digital characters Ai and Aiko, a red-shirt clad boy and his friend, a brown dog. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Mr Peter Zhuo, 39, and his son Oliver. In his other hand is a plush toy of one of his creations Ai. The characters can be seen via various media such as 3D animation, digital comics, Japanese-style stop motion, exhibitions and toys. They have generated more than 64 billion views on Giphy, a platform that allows users to search and share animated Gif files. Becoming a first-time father has put a new perspective on his work, which he was first encouraged to pursue by his grandfather, who died when Mr Zhuo was 16. “After my grandfather passed away, I always somehow felt he was somewhere where he could see I was still trying to keep my promise,\" he told TODAY. \"I had a crazy urgency to draw as big and as much as I can, so hopefully somewhere, he could see.” Working with and for children has also been a constant in Mr Zhuo’s work. He noted that his four Guinness records incidentally were all achieved in the month of October and have coincided with Children’s Day. The records were for: The largest caricature in the world in 2007 Conducting the largest art lesson in the world in 2010 with close to 1,900 participants across 12 countries The longest drawing in the world by an individual in 2014 The longest drawing in the world in 2014 CHANGING WORK DYNAMICS AS A DAD Towards the third trimester of his wife’s pregnancy with Oliver, Mr Zhuo made the “difficult decision” to switch to fully working from home in preparation for his son’s arrival. This may have changed work dynamics with his colleagues, but fatherhood has brought a greater attention to detail, and given him a fresh artistic perspective, too. Mr Zhuo said that it was almost akin to “reliving (his) life as a child” and adopting the wonder and curiosity of a baby’s “beginner’s spirit”. “It’s re-living, an opportunity for me to go to the library again, hopefully go to the zoo, animal parks, go to places that we haven’t experienced for 20 years.” Working at home has also meant that he has been on hand to celebrate his toddler’s small achievements such as balancing and rolling. He tracks Oliver’s milestones in a WhatsApp chat he “insisted” on starting with his wife and Oliver’s grandmothers, where the couple sends daily updates of their toddler. The young family’s living room has been converted into a padded gated playpen for Oliver to roll around and explore, with photos of his life so far lining a kitchen shelf. “You realise for babies, their world is very limited to the environment they are in, so it makes me realise the meaning and purpose behind Ai and Aiko, and how we can expand their world and imagination a little more with our storytelling.” Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Mr Peter Zhuo, 39, trying to play with his seven-month-old son Oliver at their home on June 11, 2024. Beyond thinking of the world from Oliver’s point of view and being motivated to inspire more \"wow\" moments for young audiences, working from home has shaped his mindset as well. “Now I have this image of Oliver looking at me everywhere I go in the house, (so I think), is this the right decision you’re making? Is this a good decision that I will be proud of?” A DAD'S DREAM For Mr Zhuo, being a father is a dream he once doubted that he would ever realise, despite growing up saying he wanted to be the first among his friends to be a father. He had imagined that he would be “single forever” before marrying in November 2022 at the age of 38. “Some of (my peers), their kids are already in secondary school, and here is Oliver, seven months.” Mr Zhuo's strong relationship with his father and grandfather, one that he wants to replicate, has helped him navigate his creative career and this new journey of fatherhood. Looking back to his own childhood, one early turning point was when he got kicked out of a free trial art lesson at six years old, being told that he could not draw or hold a pencil properly. His family was too poor to afford future lessons. To comfort him, his grandfather told him a story of a boy “just like (him)”, who had thick eyebrows, loved to wear red T-shirts and held pencils with four fingers around the pencils, and who also got rejected. “I said, 'Ah gong (grandfather), you’re just repeating what I told you'. But he said, ‘No, but that boy never gave up and eventually created Disneyland and became very successful’.” His grandfather hesitated on the name of this boy, who would become an aspirational figure for Mr Zhuo for many years, before confidently mistaking Disneyland's creator Walt Disney for the famous Spanish artist Picasso. Driven by a desire to become this “Picasso”, the design of Mr Zhuo's characters Ai and Aiko are a nod to his grandfather’s mash of Picasso and Walt Disney. Ai's hair is shaped after Picasso's illustration of a dove and the character's round face was inspired by Disney character Mickey Mouse. While his grandfather was not an artist, Mr Zhuo recalled the pencil sketches of sparrows that the old man would give him, which he thought were very life-like at the time and “the best drawings in the world”. Another “happiest moment” from his childhood was hearing the jangle of keys at the gate of his father, who was a taxi driver on the night shift, returning with supper or an early breakfast from a coffee shop. Cherishing these memories of the two generations of fathers before him, who have inspired his creative work, it has left him excited to make new ones with Oliver as a first-time father. These could be simply eating together as a family or collecting all the toddler's first drawings. “And if one day he becomes an artist, and (will) do even better than me, then I’ll be his biggest fan, again shouting and cheering,” Mr Zhuo said.

She aspired to creating her own game one day so that she could bring the joy she got from games to others. Her passion for technology led her to learn about coding, and this year Miss Jiang, now 18, created a music game called Tambourine Story. That game has propelled the Raffles Institution student to be one of 50 \"distinguished winners\" of Apple's Swift Student Challenge from around the world. It earned her a fully paid trip to Apple Park in California in the United States, hosted by the technology giant's chief executive officer Tim Cook, whom she had met in April when he visited Singapore. Back then, she showed Mr Cook her Tambourine Story game. She also got to rub shoulders with other developers at the California event. The international competition, launched in 2020 by Apple, is designed for students to showcase their coding skills and creativity by developing app playgrounds and earn real-world experience that they can take into their careers. It is named after Apple's programming language Swift.

EXPRESSING EMOTIONS THROUGH GAMES The event Miss Jiang attended on Monday (June 10) was Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in Cupertino, California, an annual gathering where the company announces new software capabilities for its devices. A total of 300 developers were \"regular\" winners at this year's event, along with the 50 \"distinguished winners\", an innovation this year. Miss Jiang is one of five Singaporeans to receive an award for the Swift Student Challenge for this year, but the only one to clinch one in the distinguished winner category. She was also one of the regular winners of the competition last year with a game dealing with mental health. She said that her latest game, Tambourine Story, which took one of the \"distinguished\" awards this year, was inspired by her love for music, having played the piano and guitar. Two years ago, she formed a band with her schoolmates and started to rehearse and play music together. “There was something different about playing music together and everything coming together and sounding really good,\" she said. \"It feels like you're part of something special. So I wanted to create something to capture that feeling and called my game Tambourine Story.” The story-based game follows a little girl’s journey of trying to join a band. Unlike other rhythm games that makes the player tap on the screen to play it, Tambourine Story requires the user to shake the iPad like a tambourine in order to play. Miss Jiang thought of the idea late last year and worked on it for two months, she said. “I just really love expressing emotions through games. I think it’s a really powerful medium.” Apple Miss Jiang Tongyu presenting her Tambourine Story game to Apple's chief executive officer Tim Cook at the Apple Developer Centre in Singapore on April 18, 2024. ‘FELT LIKE I COULD DO ANYTHING WITH TECHNOLOGY’ As a child, Miss Jiang spent a lot of time playing Minecraft and rhythm games, which also inspired Tambourine Story. Since joining the infocomm club in secondary school in 2019, she had taken part in hackathons and coding competitions. A year later, she entered Apple’s Swift Accelerator Programme, where secondary school students learn to develop a “Swift” application over the course of a year, and then publish it on the App Store. After her group’s to-do list app was published, she felt that she “could do anything with technology” and wanted to do more projects using the Swift coding language. This was when she decided to sign up for the Swift Student Challenge last year, where she created a game called City Night, focused on mental health. It clinched an award.

HOPES TO FIND A ‘MEANINGFUL’ CAREER Miss Jiang, who is now taking Higher 2 computing classes at school, said that one-third of her class are girls and that “most of them are better than the boys in coding on average”. Does the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) sector lack women? Miss Jiang responded: “I feel like most people wouldn't outright say it. But sometimes you can feel it’s a little different. “For example, when you go to a tech conference, the guys are talking. But I feel like there's definitely been a lot more recognition over the past few years. “I've been to a few events such as Girls in Tech, specially organised for students. And I think it's really good that there are all these opportunities for girls to try out different tech without being judged.” She added that society should not generalise that all girls and women do not like working in the Stem field. While she acknowledged that pursuing a tech career can lead to a good living, she felt that it makes more sense to pursue a career that one finds meaningful. Apart from considering a tech career, she is also looking at fields such as the arts. “Most people would think that tech and arts are on the opposite side of the field. But... the intersection is really interesting to me. So I would love to explore more on new media, games and animation.” Following her A-Level examination at the end of this year, Miss Jiang hopes to pursue tech or the arts at a university here or in the US. She also hopes to keep developing Tambourine Story into a longer game that would one day be on the main Apple App Store.

So I sought a healthier relationship with it instead SINGAPORE — I'd thought about committing to a digital detox for some time, especially given the rigours of my work, which requires me to be connected to my phone all day. Nurjannah Suhaimi/TODAY New: You can now listen to articles. Sorry, the audio is unavailable right now. Please try again later. This audio is AI-generated. Increasingly, people are becoming aware of the importance of mental health and well-being in our lives. In our weekly Gen Zen series, TODAY looks at ways that we can feel better while coping with the mental stresses of modern life. TODAY's journalist tried going cold turkey on her phone use outside working hours, spurred by the appealing concept of a \"digital detox\" She quickly found that trying to abstain from phone use and reclaim some mental space was not very practical and her experiment failed Acting on experts' advice, she turned to other ways of setting goals and boundaries to reduce dependency Using technology such as apps and cutting out non-essential notifications can help prevent excessive screen time, they said Small changes, instead of drastic actions, work better to create positive reinforcements By Shynn Ong By Shynn Ong Published June 17, 2024 Updated June 18, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — I'd thought about committing to a digital detox for some time, especially given the rigours of my work, which requires me to be connected to my phone all day. The concept of going cold turkey, at least during non-working hours, was appealing to me, especially after I read what my colleague Renald wrote last week. He experienced some measure of success in his week-long cold turkey experiment . I was also confident that I was disciplined enough to stick to my detox routine. I was piqued by his conclusion that he was able to reclaim his time and mental space even with the constant notifications and demands for instant responses that have become routine. However, when I gave it a go, things turned out differently and my digital detox quickly turned out to be a resounding failure. For starters, technology seemed unavoidable even as I tried to cut it out from my life. Like what Renald experienced, navigating unfamiliar places required me to use my phone as a digital guide. Even at restaurants, QR codes often replaced physical menus. Then there was also work-related communication, which I could not simply ignore. Knowing that I would never be able to function normally with zero use of my phone, I sought the advice of experts on how to instead cultivate a healthier relationship with the device while still staying connected and productive. It was through their help that I found a better solution — one that involves setting boundaries that are customised to my needs and lifestyle. USING YOUR PHONE TO HELP YOU DISCONNECT The old adage “If you can’t beat them, join them” rings true when it comes to managing phone dependency, and using technology to help us disconnect may work more effectively. Ms Chern Hui Ying, a counsellor at Huggs the Heart Therapy, recommended wellness applications like Forest, which claims on its website to help users stay focused \"on the important things in life\". In this app, users set a time limit to how long they wish to stay off their phone and a virtual tree will grow as long as they stay off their phone. If they exit the app to use their phone, the tree withers and dies. I was immediately taken by the concept. For starters, it's a cute play on the carrot-and-stick approach, though I had some reservations about whether using the app meant that I'd still be tempted to use the phone for other purposes — like doom-scrolling on social media. So, over several days, I tried out the app. I found it incredibly useful in managing my phone usage, although I admit that I gave up more than once, which caused my virtual forest to be decimated. Whenever I reached over to check my phone, the app displayed messages including \"Stop phubbing!\" and \"Get back to work\", which effectively reminded me to stay off my phone. The calming and soothing forest sounds it played in the background also created a serene environment that made concentrating easier. Perhaps it was also the discomfort of seeing my hard-earned forest wither away due to a lack of discipline that kept me motivated. Overall, Forest transformed the challenge of reducing screen time into an engaging, pleasant experience. Besides Forest, there are also other apps such as Flipd or Offtime that can also enforce breaks and provide insights into phone usage patterns, promoting a more mindful and balanced approach to phone use. ESTABLISHING GOALS AND SETTING BOUNDARIES Ultimately, these apps seek to reward healthy behaviour and punish unhealthy ones, but not in a manner that could cripple your daily life, vis a vis not being able to use the phone. It boils down to setting clear goals and allocating set periods for screen-free activities, and in reality, you don't really need an app to do that. Ms Chern said that to strike a balance between necessary phone use and reducing screen time, one way to do so is to set \"smart goals\", which refers to specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely goals. “A goal such as ‘to not use my phone’ may not be as effective as ‘to reduce time spent on my phone by 50 per cent a week’. This is due to the latter being measurable and achievable,” she added. Another expert said that setting physical and virtual boundaries for phone usage can help reduce the urge to scroll impulsively. Ms Priscilla Shin, principal psychotherapist of Range Counselling Services, said that utilising focus modes or \"do not disturb\" settings during work or relaxation times can significantly reduce interruptions. This could involve designating phone-free zones such as the dining area or bedroom and setting specific times for phone use, such as limiting social media to certain hours. In terms of virtual boundaries, turning off non-essential notifications also reduces interruptions in the hours you have set for yourself to use the phone, Ms Shin recommended. Using screen-time trackers and app blockers can also help us to monitor and limit screen time, she added. That said, how do we determine what goals and boundaries to set in the first place? Mr Chirag Agarwal, co-founder and chief growth officer of online counselling and coaching platform Talk Your Heart Out, said that we should first be honest with ourselves about how much we depend on our phones for various uses like work, administrative tasks or even entertainment. “This way, when you draw up plans to limit your usage, you do so in a way that does not disrupt your life and so you are less likely to give up altogether,” he advised. This approach can help us to work out how much is a reasonable amount when it comes to duration of phone use, he added. Acting on their advice, I set a goal to reduce my screen time on Instagram, the app I use the most, by 25 per cent. I also designated my bedroom as a phone-free zone. I admit, it was tough trying to stick to the rules I had set for myself, and the lure of instant gratification tempted me more times than I could count in the week when I tried this new approach. However, I stuck to my resolve through sheer willpower, using strategies such as disabling Instagram after 9pm and placing my phone somewhere else during my dinner time, which is a screen-free period. Gradually, I found that my urge to check my phone diminished, and I enjoyed more restful evenings without the distraction of social media. WHY SETTING BOUNDARIES IS BETTER THAN THE COLD TURKEY METHOD Compared with going cold turkey, Ms Shin from Range Counselling Service said that setting boundaries and being intentional with phone use is a more sustainable approach because it gradually reduces phone use and eases the transition. This allows people to develop healthier habits over time without the shock of an abrupt cessation. “This gradual approach also reduces stress and anxiety associated with sudden withdrawal, while positive reinforcement from incremental improvements boosts motivation,” she added. Some of Ms Shin’s clients who have adopted these methods reduced their screen time by 30 to 50 per cent, and reported that their productivity and focus levels also got a boost. Mr Agarwal from Talk Your Heart Out said that because mobile phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, it is difficult to unilaterally decide to stop using them and any attempt to go cold turkey is more likely to fail. “The idea here is to find a new healthy balance in terms of phone usage that you can sustain for the long run and not ‘kick the habit’ like you would with smoking, for instance, where the cold turkey approach may work.” HOW DO I MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE? For people (like me), who lack discipline in setting boundaries and following rules, Mr Agarwal recommended starting with small changes such as leaving the mobile phone outside the bedroom and building your way up to more challenging changes such as uninstalling a social media app. Ms Shin said that using positive reinforcement such as rewarding yourself when meeting your goals is another way to help you stay on track. “For example, giving yourself a full 30 minutes of your favourite Netflix show is one way you can celebrate a milestone,” she said of the entertainment streaming provider. Infusing fun and engagement into daily activities instead of merely trying to avoid phone usage is another approach that Ms Chern suggested, recommending that people seek out offline activities such as playing board games or spending time outdoors in the park to enjoy more fulfilling experiences. “When you are living life more fully and in the moment, there would be a reduced likelihood of being tempted to rely on your devices for entertainment,” she added. Since adopting these strategies, I felt like I had gotten more restful nights of sleep thanks to a phone-free bedroom and I also noticed fewer problems such as eye strain from excessive screen time. Socially, my interactions with my family have been more meaningful and present, where we talk about how our day went over dinner instead of being distracted by digital notifications. While these changes indeed took time and discipline, such an approach helped me to foster a more balanced relationship with my phone. For now, I will try the next step that will require even more discipline on my end: Whenever I'm left to my own devices every Saturday, I want to reduce my mindless scrolling of TikTok. And I think I can achieve this with the help of the Forest app, because it's either I cut my TikTok usage, or the app cuts down my field of carefully grown trees.

Back then, when his aunt called him out of the blue asking for a spare set of keys for her flat, Chiang knew that something was amiss despite his aunt's calm voice. He learnt that his uncle, who was locked inside his home, had collapsed from a stroke while she was at work. Since she was not home, paramedics could not open the house gate. Unable to find the keys in his family home or his grandparents' home in the same housing block, Chiang rushed to his aunt's home while another relative headed to the nearby market to find a locksmith. “ Although she was relied on to take care of my uncle who had suffered a stroke before, she was not trusted enough to own a set of keys. And that lack of trust had consequences. Film director Chiang Wei Liang, speaking of a domestic worker in his uncle's family ” When he arrived, he was greeted by a terrifying, chaotic situation — paramedics were shouting instructions through the flat's locked gates as his uncle lay motionless on the floor and their young domestic worker from Myanmar knelt by his uncle's side, rubbing his hands. \"The young girl didn't know what to do because she spoke little English. By all accounts, she was very attentive and responsible, having worked for my aunt for three years,\" Chiang, now 37, said in a video-call interview with TODAY. \"Although she was relied on to take care of my uncle who had suffered a stroke before, she was not trusted enough to own a set of keys. And that lack of trust had consequences.\" Paramedics finally gained access to the flat but the stroke left his uncle bedridden. Chiang, who has been mainly Taiwan-based for more than 15 years, was in Singapore at the time to become a caregiver for his sick mother and sister when the incident occurred. The incident left him thinking about the relative trust that the family had placed in him compared to that in the domestic worker. Later, while back in Taiwan working on a film, Chiang met a group of migrant workers moonlighting as caregivers for the old in the rural areas of Taiwan. The similarities between them and his aunt’s helper in Singapore struck a chord — and he made it the centre of his debut feature film, Mongrel. The two-hour film is centred around the character Oom, played by Thai actor Wanlop Rungkumjad. Oom is a Thai illegal worker who becomes a caregiver to a sick elderly woman and her handicapped son in the Taiwan mountains. E&W Films A movie still from Mongrel, a film about an illegal migrant worker who has to look after an elderly woman in the mountains of Taiwan. E&W Films Thai actor Wanlop Rungkumjad (left) plays Oom, an illegal migrant worker taking care of an old woman and her disabled son in a rural area in Taiwan. As Oom struggles under the unreasonable demands of his exploitative boss, he is forced to choose between dignity and survival. The sombre film not only premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in France last month — it was also awarded the Camera d’Or Special Mention. The Camera d'Or recognises the best first feature film at Cannes, while the special mention is for films that do not win the main prize but deserve recognition. It is not awarded every year and was last given out in 2009. A film critic from Britain's newspaper The Guardian last month gave the film four stars out of five, saying it is a \"Zen-like tale of compassion and suffering among migrant care workers\". In 2013, Singaporean film Ilo Ilo became the first film to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival when it clinched the Camera d’Or. Although Mongrel may be the first Singapore film to get a special mention, Chiang admitted that his first reaction to learning of the award was concern about where to get outfits at short notice for his parents who were attending the ceremony. AFP Singaporean director Chiang Wei Liang (left) and Taiwanese director You Qiao Yin posing for a photo after they won the Camera d'Or Special Mention for the film Mongrel at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, southern France, on May 25, 2024. Mongrel's producer Lai Wei Jie, 41, a Singaporean, told TODAY on Thursday (June 20): \"We were definitely more excited about the film being selected for Cannes (than winning). \"There’s no better place for Mongrel… I cried while watching the premiere, even though I watched it at least 100 times before. It’s different (watching) it on the big screen.\" DIVERSITY AND REALITY While filming a scene mirroring the medical emergency that Chiang’s uncle went through, a man living near the filming site had a cardiac arrest. As they were in a rural mountainous area of Taiwan, the ambulance took 45 minutes to arrive. Emergency medical technicians hired to act in the film rushed to the man's aid, but he could not be saved. After the incident, filming resumed — capturing the raw emotions of the emergency medical technicians as they acted out a scene that almost mirrored the real-world drama that had played out minutes earlier. The stark similarity left some of the crew shaken as they witnessed first-hand that Mongrel was more than a film — it was reality. This essence of reality is captured in every detail in the film, the director and producers told TODAY. The film was set in the mountains, for example, because these rural areas are where illegal migrant caregivers are heavily relied on to care for older residents living hours away from the nearest healthcare facility, Chiang explained. The mountains are also where immigrants hide when they run away from their exploitative employers. Chiang said that he also chose a Thai immigrant as the main character to pay homage to the Thais being the first foreign workers allowed to work in Taiwan in 1991. When it came to casting, Chiang, Lai and co-producer Elizabeth Wijaya, 40, a Singapore permanent resident, said that they wanted the role of Hui, the handicapped man cared for by Oom, to be acted by a person with disabilities. This was because Hui was the “emotional core” of the film, and they wanted an actor who could relate strongly. To do so, they scoured Taiwan for an actor who was conscientious, could take directions, take part in acting workshops and commit to the gruelling production schedule. They eventually cast Mr Kuo Shu-wei, a Taiwanese man with cerebral palsy who teaches other people with disabilities to use technology to communicate. Despite his lack of acting experience, he quickly picked up some techniques from an acting coach on set. Chiang also told TODAY that directing Mongrel would not have been possible without Lai and Wijaya’s help. The duo runs development and production company E&W Films. \"They are artisans (who are) willing to take on a film like Mongrel… you need to be gutsy and courageous enough to create this kind of film,\" Chiang said. IMPACT AND PURPOSE With reality so closely captured in the feature film, Chiang admitted that he struggled to understand the impact of the film, and wondered if there will be any impact at all. Throughout his career, Chiang's films have often circled around the social issues of the Southeast Asian diaspora . His 2017 short film Nyi Ma Lay is about foreign domestic workers in Singapore, while his 2018 VR film Only The Mountain Remains is about immigrants running away to Taiwan's mountains. As the years went on, he got somewhat frustrated that little has been done to address the exploitation of Southeast Asian labour globally. \"This is the biggest question that I have had, to sum up my career of 15 years. What can I do, or what can the film do,\" he said, noting that legislative change still holds the biggest impact. “A filmmaker receiving a prize at the most prestigious (film) festival in the world. Great. But what does the film do?” Grappling with this, Chiang plans to take a break before he finds the next subject to spotlight in in his future work. He also hopes to mentor a future generation of film-makers in Taiwan and Singapore. What’s next for Lai and Wijaya? The couple are working to have Mongrel screened in Singapore, and are producing two other films at E&W Films. They did not share more details on the films. And if Mongrel makes it to cinemas here, they hope that the audience will spend time pondering the marginalisation of migrant workers and the stressors of caregiving. Wijaya noted that the film at least has an impact among audience members who watched the premiere at the Director's Fortnight at Cannes — the only section that allows the public to buy a ticket to watch films. Some viewers told Chiang that they could relate to the caregiver's woes. Wijaya said: \"Legislative change is important to address these issues but so is movements of the heart. A film can also be about convincing certain feelings and emotions.\" Related topics Cannes Film Festival migrant worker Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-hQ79MrSoOnc')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-6NruAif_Pug')); Trending Content is loading...

Some junior doctors in Singapore, burnt out by long hours of work , believe that more are “tempted” to break their medical service bond Breaking the bond with MOH Holdings comes with a high financial cost, but the perks of a job in the private sector far outweigh the cons, they said The Ministry of Health recently said it has finalised the recommendations of a committee set up to improve the well-being of junior doctors Some doctors said they appreciated recent initiatives such as remuneration for weekend shifts However, the pull of the private sector remains “tempting” if not enough is being done to incentivise doctors to stay By Renald Loh By Renald Loh Published June 22, 2024 Updated June 22, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — It was during her 19th consecutive day of work as a junior doctor at a public hospital three years ago that Dr Faith Choo, physically and mentally drained, first considered breaking her medical service bond. She still had a long way to go until the end of the bond she had signed with MOH Holdings (MOHH), the holding company for Singapore's public healthcare institutions. The agreement requires her to work in the public healthcare sector for five years upon graduation. This does not include a year of internship, or housemanship, which commences right after graduation. To break the bond, she would have to repay around S$100,000 for each year of service she did not fulfil. However, barely a year in, the then 24-year-old was already mulling if it would be worth forking out that hefty sum if it meant freedom from constant scrutiny at work while being perennially sleep-deprived and physically unwell. Dr Choo, now 27, said: “It got me wondering whether it was worth it in the long run, sacrificing so much of my health and my youth. Because if you do it for five, six years, you don't know — maybe you're shortening your lifespan by a couple of years.” She broke her bond in 2022 and now works as a locum doctor in the private sector, covering the duties of regular doctors who are on leave or unable to work. Dr Choo's experience was far from unique. The high rate of burnout among junior doctors led the Government to set up the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors in December 2021, to look into the issue and recommend ways to promote the well-being of junior doctors in the public healthcare system. Last month, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in response to a parliamentary question that this committee, which comprises both senior and junior doctors, had finalised its recommendations. These include “setting clearer work hour guidelines for junior doctors, enhancing career guidance, and promoting a safe and supportive environment for junior doctors”, the ministry said, without giving specifics. TODAY has reached out to MOH for further details, but have yet to receive a response at time of publication. Even with the committee working on this, doctors have in recent months turned to online forum Reddit to vent about their long working hours. One Reddit user, who identified as a Singapore doctor, specifically bemoaned the traditional “call system” at public hospitals. While on call, a doctor may work up to 30 hours straight — a full day of work followed by the night shift, and up until the following afternoon. Commenting on this, Dr Choo said that this call system has repercussions for patients as well. “I realised it's quite dangerous for patient safety, because (the sleep deprivation) really reduces the quality of care that I could provide to them.” Dr Koh Poh Koon, formerly Senior Minister of State for Health, said in 2022 that although Singapore Medical Council's guidelines state that junior doctors may work up to 80 hours a week, surveys showed that 20 per cent of them exceeded this. TODAY spoke to seven junior doctors in Singapore, most of whom did not provide their real names for fear that speaking out would affect their careers. Although work hours and workloads differed based on where they are posted, all said that they were burnt out and many are considering leaving the public sector. PRIVATE SECTOR WORK A ‘MUCH BETTER DEAL’ In March 2023, MOH said that the attrition rate of all doctors in the public healthcare sector had “remained stable in the last three years”, ranging from 3 to 5 per cent, but did not specify the rate for junior doctors. Data on the proportion or number of junior doctors who break their bonds are not publicly available either. However, those who spoke to TODAY said they believe that more junior doctors are planning to do so. The feeling of being overworked lies at the heart of their complaints. What makes the lifestyle harder to bear are the comparatively “better” lives that doctors in the private sector appear to have. Bryan, a medical officer in his late 20s working at a public hospital, said that it is “tempting” to break his bond early and work in a private clinic, in spite of the large amount of liquidated damages he would have to pay MOHH. He earns a monthly salary of around S$5,000, not including the allowance he receives for working weekend rounds. In contrast, a locum earns an average of S$10,000 a month. One 27-year-old interviewee, who took a loan to break her MOHH bond and then work as a locum in the private sector this year, said that she now earns S$14,000 to S$18,000 a month by taking on more locum gigs. This is up from the S$5,000 a month that she earned in the public sector. Bryan said: “You’re not getting paid as much compared to working as a locum in the private sector. Their hours are way better, they get more flexibility, and they get to pursue things outside of medicine, too.\" And those who choose to break their bonds may not even have to fork out the penalty themselves. Bryan said that private clinics have approached several of his peers to offer them jobs as locum doctors, effective immediately, and even offered to pay off their bonds for them. Several other doctors said that this form of headhunting is a common practice in the medical industry. TODAY reached out to several private healthcare companies but all declined to comment. The attraction is not just about the money. For many, the pull of the private sector is the level of autonomy and control that they would have over their lives. Tom, a former medical officer in his early thirties who broke his bond in 2021 and now works in the private sector, said: “If I earn more money, it's because I choose to work more hours. If I have more patients that follow me and consult with me, it’s because I deliver good service. “So now, I wield the power to make a difference that actually matters.” In response to TODAY's queries, Member of Parliament (MP) Yip Hon Weng, who is part of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, acknowledged that the public sector, while essential, is often unable to match the remuneration offered by the private sector. \"Moreover, junior doctors often feel like 'cogs in a machine', with their personal strengths and interests overlooked,\" Mr Yip said. ‘FACELESS BUNCH OF MANPOWER’ Another gripe that junior doctors have is with the residency system. To become a specialist in Singapore, a medical officer must be selected for a residency programme, such as for anaesthesiology, neurosurgery and ophthalmology, which can take three to six years to complete. However, applications for these residency programmes open only once a year and can be incredibly competitive. Certain specialisations have much higher demand than there are slots available. This means many applicants inevitably miss out on their preferred programme and have to try again the following year. Interviewees said that some junior doctors, after failing in their initial applications, decide not to try again and cut their losses by breaking their bonds. This is because their career “runway” as a fully fledged specialist becomes shorter, and they would have to rethink plans for their own personal lives. Tom, who now works in aesthetic medicine, said this is one example of how junior doctors end up feeling disillusioned. “A lot of us have different passions, different callings and different abilities,” Tom added. “But instead of being developed and nurtured for our strengths, we’re being fit into a mould — we’re told we have to fill this need and that need, and therefore whatever else you can do does not matter. “It’s like we’re a faceless bunch of manpower.” MEASURES TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING OF DOCTORS Anna, a 29-year-old medical officer working in a public hospital, said that she appreciates the initiatives that have been introduced over the years to better care for junior doctors. One is the allowance given to doctors who work weekends , which came into place in February 2023. At some hospitals, there is also strict end-shift timings for staff members and a night-float system to replace the traditional call system. In a night-float system, a dedicated team of doctors take over the care of patients for consecutive nights in a week, and a different team of doctors resume care of patients the following day. This usually entails an overnight shift of 12 to 15 hours. It eliminates the need for prolonged working hours and allows junior doctors more rest. The National University Health System (NUHS), one of three healthcare clusters in Singapore, said that it has put in place the night-float system in some departments in the National University Hospital since 2007 and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital since 2015. \"To manage the manpower required to support this system, the night float is hybridised with doctors who also perform traditional night calls in a 24-hour shift until 8am the following day,\" NUHS said. However, interviewees noted that the system has not been set up at all public hospitals, and junior doctors are not in control over which healthcare institution they are posted to work. And even with these initiatives in place, Anna said that “it doesn’t mean it’s great or ideal now”. Others pointed out smaller initiatives that have been introduced to help them, such as the offering of occasional snack packs and online seminars on how to manage stress, but they said that these are far from adequate and do not tackle the problem of overwork. EFFORTS BY SINGAPORE'S HEALTHCARE CLUSTERS Since 2017, Singapore's public healthcare system has been organised into three integrated clusters. They are the National Healthcare Group (NHG), SingHealth, and the National University Health System (NUHS). TODAY reached out to all three to understand the measures and initiatives they have taken to ensure junior doctors' well-being and address their concerns. 1. National University Health System (NUHS) With the night float system, a dedicated team of doctors take over the care of patients for consecutive nights in a week, and a different team of doctors resume care of patients the following day. Besides this, NUHS said that the cluster has also introduced parallel career tracks such as the Hospital Clinician scheme for non-specialist doctors who anchor inpatient care services in a role complementary to specialists. Additionally, NUHS has rolled out the following measures: Formal feedback sessions at certain milestones of each posting, where suggestions and feedback are recorded and acted on, where feasible Monthly \"Mind-Body Medicine\" sessions to introduce the concepts of mindfulness and reflection to help junior doctors cope with work-life challenges Proactive counselling and psychosocial support, with access to confidential counselling by an independent psychologist working outside the hospital system The formation of an NUHS Wellbeing Office that develops and spearheads the NUHS community's holistic well-being strategy The Get Rid of Stupid Stuff (Gross) initiative, which encourages workers to provide suggestions to eliminate unnecessary processes and improve efficiency Confidential counselling services are also provided to all employees to support mental health and well-being 2. SingHealth Professor Terrance Chua, who is the group chairman (medical board) for SingHealth, said that strong support for healthcare professionals, including junior doctors, is fundamental in enabling them to provide the best care they can to patients. To help do this, SingHealth said that it has put in place the following: The formation of a SingHealth Junior Doctor Well-being Committee at each of its hospital campuses in 2020 to foster a sense of community among junior doctors Two targeted workgroups at cluster-level to look into ward-round practices and work hours to address clinical and operational issues that may affect workers' morale Post-graduate training programmes, courses and workshops to enhance junior doctors' knowledge and skills The Hospital Clinician Scheme, developed to provide an alternative standardised career track for junior doctors who wish to work in public hospitals Regular engagement sessions for feedback and career support and development Dedicated employee care helplines manned by trained and experienced volunteer medical social workers, counsellors and psychologists A SingHealth-wide peer support network of about 480 peer supporters among its workers who are trained to extend emotional support to fellow colleagues 3. National Healthcare Group (NHG) Associate Professor Faith Chia, who is the designated institutional official for NHG Residency, said that the cluster recognises that the well-being of doctors directly affects patient safety and care quality. NHG said that it has introduced initiatives such as: An Annual Career Day held for all junior doctors to share training, career and research opportunities A well-being committee that oversees a curriculum to build resilience and well-being, titled Managing Self, Others and Building Resilience. This includes self-care strategies and management of fatigue, conflict and negotiation Having external experts provide confidential counselling for its junior doctors, when necessary and appropriate A Medical Officer Well-being Committee in 2022 to focus on the well-being and professional development of its medical officers across the cluster Regular welfare and well-being programmes available to all doctors, such as sports and physical activities, mental wellness programmes and bonding sessions The peer-elected NHG Resident Council, where members advocate for residents’ and junior doctors’ interests and welfare, and facilitate feedback to senior management Assoc Prof Chia added that NHG would also be launching a new career guidance counselling portal and mentor-matching system in the coming academic year. Collapse to view Expand to view WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE DONE? Mr Yip, who is the MP for Yio Chu Kang, said that while MOH has made some adjustments to improve the situation, \"there is more to be done\". \"Medicine is more than a job; it is a calling that requires dedication and sacrifice ,\" he added. \"The public sector must strive to provide a supportive environment that recognises and rewards these sacrifices while ensuring the sustainability of our healthcare system.\" To that end, Mr Yip offered several suggestions of his own, including: Introducing shift work with a fixed number of hours a week, similar to the system in Australia, to help mitigate burnout Providing significant pay increases for those working in demanding specialties such as vascular surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, renal medicine or neurosurgery Making service work meaningful by allowing junior doctors opportunities to upskill in areas they are passionate about Increasing medical school intake to ensure a steady pipeline of junior doctors to help alleviate the workload, while simultaneously managing expectations during the selection process to ensuring prospective medical students are aware of the sacrifices involved Introducing significant pay differentials for rotations in demanding specialties, commonly known in the industry as \"hardship postings\", in order to help attract and retain junior doctors in these fields To prevent an exodus to the private sector, Mr Yip said that MOH could consider extending the period of a doctor's conditional registration and re-evaluate the need for certain specialties. Mr Louis Ng, MP for Nee Soon Group Representation Constituency who had asked MOH for an update on the review of junior doctors' welfare in a parliamentary question, told TODAY that there may be a huge impact on the healthcare system if the issues that junior doctors face are not resolved soon. “I think it's a vicious circle. As more (doctors) leave, the remaining ones have to work more. When the remaining ones work more, the attrition goes up — and we have seen that first hand during Covid-19 with the nurses . “I think it's a sad problem that we have such young doctors who are burning out so fast.” Related topics doctor healthcare worker MOH healthcare Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-7pP3gAoy-Fk')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity--kb98TqmjzU')); Trending Content is loading...

At the age of just 25, Hazieq Nizam has opened his own shop offering repair and maintenance services for guitars and other string instruments He opened this shop using earnings he saved up from offering his services as a side-hustle for five years Despite his youth, he has already worked with numerous Singapore and international acts He is now away for a month in support of Singapore band Wormrot's 24-stop concert tour around Europe By Taufiq Zalizan By Taufiq Zalizan Published June 22, 2024 Updated June 22, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — When I paid a visit to Wax Guitar Services near Beauty World MRT Station recently, I was greeted by the sight of the instrument repair shop’s young owner Hazieq Nizam lost in his work. He was hunched over an electric guitar with a dead serious expression on his face that was lit by a tiny desk lamp reflecting off the instrument he was holding. Not wanting to interrupt, I paused to take in the smell of soldering iron and the sound of John Mayer’s guitar riff playing on a music system in the background as I looked around the interior of his six-month-old shop. Not that it took long to finish scanning around the 8-sqm humble studio. Mr Hazieq’s serious expression immediately broke into a grin when we exchanged pleasantries. “Hi, I’m Wax,” the 25-year-old guitar technician said, using the nickname that his friends and clients call him. Guitar technicians such as Mr Hazieq provide a range of services from fixing faulty instruments such as guitars and bass guitars , modifying them to desired specifications or setting them up to make them comfortable and easy to play for their owners. Although there are quite a number of such technicians here — I myself know a dozen and have sent guitars to about half of them — there are some traits that make Mr Hazieq stand out from the rest. Many of such \"techies\" provide their services from home. Most who do have a physical store are much older than him, have operated for years, if not decades, and are well known by guitar enthusiasts in Singapore. Besides being a super young towkay (boss) of his own shop, Mr Hazieq has learnt from luthiers and technicians here and in neighbouring countries. A luthier is an artisan who builds or repairs stringed instruments with a neck and soundbox, such as a guitar. Another string to his bow: Mr Hazieq has provided his services to visiting international acts. Now he is travelling around Europe and the United Kingdom to provide his services to support Singapore band Wormrot on their tour. The band play what is known as grindcore, often described as an aggressive sub-genre of heavy metal. Mr Hazieq plays guitar in his own band as well, but his true passion is nurturing the instruments of others. Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Mr Hazieq Nizam, 25, repairing guitars in his guitar studio in Upper Bukit Timah on May 29, 2024. HOW HIS MUSIC JOURNEY STARTED Music has been front and centre almost his entire life, Mr Hazieq told TODAY. He grew up in a family of music lovers and was constantly exposed to various types of music. One story told by his parents is that the first discernible sounds out of his mouth as a baby were not words. Mr Hazieq said: “There's this very popular song called Master of Puppets. So I was babbling the intro riff even before I said my first few words.” Master of Puppets is a 1986 classic track from heavy metal band Metallica. Even the moniker Wax is a reference to the song I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of? by American rock band A Day To Remember. Mr Hazieq began playing guitar in his teens. During his days as a polytechnic student, he took up an electronics-related module and joined a performance co-curricular activity where he began tinkering with guitars. “In our inventory at that time, there were about 20 faulty guitars. So in my spare time, I tried repairing them out of instinct and it made me realise, 'Hey, I can do it'.” He later worked as an intern at a music retailer where he learnt the craft from a guitar tech. Mr Hazeiq recalled how at one point as a student, he sent his own guitar to a tech for a set-up, but the service was disappointing. \"I gave him all the limited money that I had, but when I got it back, (I found that) this guy only changed the strings,\" he recalled. As he took up this type of work as a side gig of his own, that early experience made him strive to price his own services affordably. “If a 15-year-old kid wants to come to my shop asking for guitar repair, I will not have the heart to charge him a good amount of money,” he added. From the earnings made up of such relatively affordable fees, the money he saved from this side gig for about five years was eventually enough for him to invest in a studio space of his own early this year. He declined to reveal how much he spent on the studio, only to proudly say that he did not take up any loan for his business venture. To scrimp and save further, he put in a lot of work by himself when setting up shop. He built his own work table, painted the shop and did the lighting himself — instead of paying others to do it for him. “Because I come from a humble background, I understand the value of money. The money shouldn't be spent on unnecessary things.” Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Mr Hazieq Nizam, 25, strumming a guitar he handmade with his teacher, in his guitar studio at Upper Bukit Timah on May 29, 2024. LEARNING FROM THE EXPERTS As I surveyed Wax Studio, I saw that between the working bench against the left wall and the racks of customers’ instruments on the right, there was barely enough space for one person to sit. Yet, there was enough room for the little signs of Mr Hazieq’s outsized achievements and proud moments. On the mini-fridge door at the end of the room and on the wall above his work bench were backstage passes and Polaroid photos capturing various acts he supported. They include American post-rock band Caspian and international guitarist Yvette Young from math-rock band Covet. \"I grew up with (Young's) music, so for me to be able to work on her guitar is already a crazy experience,\" he said. When Canadian rock band Sum 41 came to Singapore as part of their farewell tour, Mr Hazieq also “understudied” their touring guitar and bass tech Tom Reardon , a renowned technician who also works for acts such as Matchbox 20 and a few others. Near the back of his guitar shop was an acoustic guitar that he handcrafted on his own while staying for a month with a luthier in Malaysia last year. He had spent the month isolated on the outskirts of its capital city Kuala Lumpur purely to deepen his knowledge of guitars and wood, he said. It was also during his stay in Malaysia that he got inspired to go all-in and make guitar servicing his full-time job. “To be honest with you, at age 25, I did not think about making guitar repair as a full-time job at first,” he added. Then, he read a book while taking a break there one day and came across a quote, which he read to me: \"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\" He said: “So (what I learnt was), if you have an idea, or if you have something that you want to do, just give your best.” BEYOND THE STUDIO While he would encourage others to pursue their dreams, he was not shy to tell of the amount of hard work he has to put in to make his own come true. His shop officially operates until 7pm, but he typically works through until 10pm. He did not want to say much about his ambitions or long-term career plans, adding that he prefers to share more about his plans with others only after they have materialised. What he would let on was that he would love to get opportunities to work for other acts both here and overseas. And for his brand, he would love to see Wax Studio offer more services for all music lovers out there. At the moment, he is ecstatic about touring with Wormrot for their 24-stop tour around Europe and the United Kingdom from early June to July. “This is going to be my very first tour with a band, and also my first time in Europe” he told TODAY excitedly in the studio before he left Singapore. While he would not be able to tend to his clients immediately, they may still drop off their instruments at his shop in his absence. Asked to look back at what he has achieved so far, he leaves no doubt about his commitment, despite the highs and lows that come with running one's own business. \"Doing what I love is very fulfilling and I wouldn't have it any other way.” Related topics music repair work business Read more of the latest in Features Explore now Advertisement window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-p9h32U7b2cA')); window.adEntity = window.adEntity || {queue: []}; window.adEntity.queue.push(document.getElementById('ad-entity-Ky5HYJJqXwY')); Trending Content is loading...

Mardhiah Ahmad Published July 9, 2023 Updated July 9, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I’ve always believed in the importance of continuous learning. After all, we live in a world that is constantly evolving, and if we don’t keep up, we risk being left behind. I am an assistant station manager at SMRT Corporation, supporting the day-to-day operations at the Gardens by the Bay station. Before this, I was a crane operator from 2012 to 2018, and a safety coordinator from 2020 to 2022 at a construction site. I graduated from ITE College East in 2010 with a certificate in audio and video production, and completed an advanced certificate in workplace safety and health, which was relevant to my previous jobs, at NTUC LearningHub in 2020. I wanted a more challenging role that would give me better opportunities for career growth. In March 2021, I came across Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Rail Operations Professionals . It is a place-and-train programme offered by SMRT for mid-career individuals keen on joining the rail industry. It has classroom lessons covering topics such as first aid and train service operations. After about five months, trainees go on to become assistant station managers or station managers with SMRT. I was convinced this programme was what I was looking for as it would allow me to venture into a new sector but still put my prior experience to good use. What attracted me most about joining rail operations was the opportunity to operate trains and to learn more about them. As someone who enjoys hands-on work, I was keen to explore the ins and outs of train stations and services. I was employed by SMRT and accepted into the programme in January 2022. Initially, it was difficult for me to catch up with the training, as it had been a while since I had left school. However, I was thankful to be able to grasp the different concepts and skills and relate them to my experience as a crane operator. For example, having a good understanding of how to operate and maintain machines and tools, and being able to remain calm in stressful situations, are relevant in rail operations. I was confident that this would help me to step into the new role successfully. The five-month training helped me better adapt into my role as an assistant station manager. It was a big change from my previous job, but I was excited to take on this new challenge. My responsibilities now include conducting security patrols, providing customer service, and performing duties in the passenger service centre. I also act as an emergency train operator when required and provide support during rail incidents and emergencies. Although my previous construction role had its fair share of leadership opportunities, there were limitations to how much I could contribute, which impeded my ability to showcase my potential as a leader. I feel that I am much more challenged in my current role as it allows me to put the skills I have learned to use on a daily basis. Adjusting to a new work environment can be difficult, but I knew that having the right attitude and beliefs, such as wanting to serve from the heart and always putting commuters first, play a huge part in this industry. Thankfully, with the support of my colleagues and trainers, I was able to cope with the challenges, juggling work responsibilities with family commitments. Not only have I built good rapport with my colleagues, I also feel more valued at work. Both my mother and grandmother are happy with my career switch, too, as they feel that the new role promises better stability and allows room for me to grow and learn. After attending in-house and external training, I hope to take on bigger roles in future, such as becoming a senior assistant station manager or station manager. Through this experience, I’ve learnt that embracing new opportunities can be incredibly rewarding, even if it means getting out of your comfort zone. I’ve gained new skills, made new connections, and have a greater sense of fulfilment in my work. More importantly, I’ve also learnt it’s never too late to start learning something new.

Despite having a different approach to learning than his younger coursemates, it is important to embrace new technologies to stay relevant, he says. Toh Hong Giep Published July 16, 2023 Updated July 18, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn In today's rapidly changing world, continuous learning is not just a nice-to-have — it is a necessity. As an IT professional with more than 20 years of experience working in multiple countries, I understand the importance of keeping up with the latest technologies and business practices. I am currently an IT director with a government agency. My responsibilities include overseeing projects to ensure that they receive timely support and actively engaging stakeholders to stay in tune with their business needs. Equally important, I will roll up my sleeves and work alongside my team to fix technical issues. One concept that has been particularly useful in my career is the idea of being a “T-shaped” person through lifelong learning. This means having broad knowledge and skills across different disciplines (the top of the T) and deep expertise in one or a few specific areas (the vertical line of the T). For example, to enhance my understanding of the business world beyond the technology lens, I pursued the Tsinghua-Insead Executive MBA programme (EMBA) in 2007. This was 10 years after I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems & Information Science from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 1997. The EMBA was an 18-month programme, anchored in Singapore and Beijing, with lessons in Fontainebleau, France and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. It provided me with a broader perspective on business, ranging from strategy and marketing to finance and operations. I also got to interact with professionals from different industries, which gave me a fresh perspective on various business challenges. The course opened my eyes to the myriad and complex decisions often faced by senior management. This allowed me to better approach issues from their perspective and build closer partnerships. My passion for learning did not stop after my EMBA. In 2021, at the age of 49, I enrolled in the NUS Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) programme and will graduate this year. I’ve always enjoyed studying computer science and this programme was a great opportunity to get a deep technical understanding of the various techniques and tools used in data analytics. It covers topics like fraud analysis, propensity analysis and recommendation engines which businesses use to predict what customers will like. Lifelong learning is not without its challenges. As a working professional, finding time to learn can be hard. It is difficult to balance work, family, and personal commitments. Luckily, my wife and two teenage children are very supportive. To strike a balance between family and study, I usually set aside weekend afternoons or evenings for family activities while leaving the rest for my coursework. Even with family support, staying motivated and focused can be daunting. To overcome this, I break my coursework down into manageable tasks and proactively seek support from faculty members and fellow classmates. Interacting with classmates from the younger generation, especially millennials, I see that they have a different approach to learning. They are more digitally savvy and prefer interactive and engaging methods such as gamification and micro-learning. While this may not appeal to everyone, it is important to embrace new technologies and learning models to stay relevant in the digital age. For example, I learned to go back to lecture recordings or use online resources to clarify any unclear points. This works well for me as I can schedule my learning to fit pockets of free time. Being a T-shaped person has made me more versatile, adaptable, and valuable to employers. It has allowed me to collaborate across different fields and apply knowledge from various areas to solve problems. Despite the challenges, lifelong learning has been fulfilling and rewarding, and has allowed me to grow personally and professionally. As the car magnate Henry Ford once said, \"Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at 20 or 80. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.\" ABOUT THE WRITER: Mr Toh Hong Giep, 51, is an IT director with a government agency.

In this instalment, Mr Mohammed Faiz Junaidi, 38, recounts his academic journey from the Institute of Technical Education to completing his master's degree as an adult. Despite his early struggles, he discovered his passion for his career as a safety professional and upgraded his skills over the years to retain his competitive edge. Mohammed Faiz Junaidi Published July 23, 2023 Updated July 26, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I completed my Master of Science in Health and Safety at the Management Development Institute of Singapore (MDIS) in March. This was just a year after getting my Bachelor of Science in Safety, Health and Environmental Management , also at MDIS, at the age of 37. Looking back at my 16 years as a safety professional, I would not have imagined achieving this when I was younger. As a child, I had a mischievous nature and found it difficult to sit still. Staying focused was a challenge, as images of toys and cartoons continuously flashed through my head. As I got older, my mind would often wander to football. During that period, conversations on mental conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder were scarce, and I did not seek medical attention or get a diagnosis. Luckily, my academic performance was unaffected. I finished primary school in 1997 and subsequently passed my GCE N-Levels. With my parents’ encouragement, I completed a Nitec in Automotive Technology (Light Vehicles) at the Institute of Technical Education Ang Mo Kio. In 2007, I began working as a technician at ComfortDelGro’s taxi service centre after my National Service. However, my time in the automotive industry was short-lived. A few months later, I was offered a position as a trainee safety advisor in the oil and gas industry. This marked the beginning of my career in Health, Safety and the Environment (HSE). I was motivated to advance in this career as I saw how safety lapses led to injuries, and how machinery became faulty in the hands of untrained workers. I also enjoyed communicating with workers and their management on how to prevent injuries and unnecessary breakdowns. I obtained a specialist diploma in workplace safety and health at the BCA Academy in 2011. This allowed me to become a registered safety officer recognised by the Ministry of Manpower. During that period, balancing my work with part-time studies was still manageable because I was still single. I was then a safety coordinator in the oil and gas sector and planned my night classes around my shifts. In the following years, I observed changes in the industry, such as more foreigners getting registered as safety officers. Most job postings also required safety officers to have degrees. Thus, in 2019, I enrolled in my degree programme at MDIS. I chose MDIS for its attractive fees and because its degree is IOSH-accredited. IOSH, or the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, is a global organisation for health and safety professionals. I felt that such accreditation would give me an edge over similar degrees from other institutions. Compared to my previous studies in 2011, I had to care for my two children, then aged one and four, and support my wife. I was then a HSE advisor for an integrated facility management company working normal office hours. When I returned to school, I was excited and nervous. The lecturers were very accommodating to our work commitments. They shared their contact details with us so we could reach them if we had questions. A big challenge that I faced when attending school was that I had less time to play with my children. When I got home after class, they would be sleeping, and would still be asleep the next morning when I left for work. Nevertheless, with my family’s unwavering support, I excelled in my bachelor's programme and graduated with first-class honours. I was eager to continue my professional growth and started my master’s course exactly a year later. It was an easy decision to carry on at MDIS, thanks to the lecturers who assisted us. Furthering my studies was a dream which I thought was unachievable since I was from the ITE stream. Through my academic journey, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the HSE field, including best practices in risk management, occupational safety, and environmental sustainability. I have also honed my analytical skills, enabling my ability to identify potential hazards and develop effective strategies to mitigate them. As I reflect on my journey thus far, I am grateful for the opportunities that have shaped me into what I am today.

Nuria Ling/TODAY Benjamin Joshua Ong Published August 3, 2023 Updated October 20, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I wonder whether anyone would seriously argue that requiring helmets or safety harnesses for construction workers would be undesirable because of “real, practical and operational complexities”. Of course there are complexities and costs, but we as a society tackle these complexities and incur these costs because human safety is at stake . Respect for safety and human life is part of our social compact. Therefore, the alleged “complexities” of arranging bus transport for workers, instead of having them ride in lorries, would not involve a “change in the social compact”, as various businesses have claimed . Far from it — it would advance the values that Singaporeans hold dear. One might argue that costs may increase (although I have seen no attempt to quantify these costs concretely). But other safety measures — protective equipment, safety protocols, and limits on working hours also cost money. The question, then, is whether taking more steps to secure the safety of workers, to the equal extent that we secure the safety of other road users, is worth the money. I say it is. And if the costs of prohibiting lorry transport are intangible, I ask: What about the intangible costs of allowing it? Would workers who are made to ride in lorries lose morale, resulting in a diminished question of work? Perhaps this argument is speculative. But it is no less speculative than the claims by the business groups that banning lorry transport will cause traffic jams . There is also an issue of consistency in policy. If riding in the back of a lorry is safe, why should workers be the only ones carried in lorries? If lorries are deemed safe enough, why not allow large families or groups of friends to get around in lorries instead of multiple cars? Why not allow minibus operators to provide lorry transport for the public, or have a lorry service to carry groups of tourists on tours? Why not replace school buses with lorries (which can probably hold more children)? These, too, may well be cheaper for everyone. But if lorry transport is deemed not safe enough for the public generally — even if it is cheaper — then why should we consider it safe enough for some workers?

Today, however, I speak the language of programming in the technology industry. Red Alpha The writer is undergoing a cybersecurity specialist training programme with Red Alpha Cybersecurity, after previously working for two years as a veterinary technician. Elroy Xu Published August 6, 2023 Updated October 24, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn My innate love for animals from young and the desire to help them had led me to turning it into a veterinary career. Today, however, I speak the language of programming in the technology industry. The change, drastic as it may sounds, wasn’t made out of necessity. Rather, it stemmed from a self-reflecting period where I chose to push myself beyond passion to explore other career options. I graduated with a Diploma in Veterinary Bioscience from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2016 and worked as a veterinary technician at an animal clinic for two years from 2019 to 2020 after completing my national service. Many things were uncertain at that time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. People were losing their jobs and workers being forced to change career paths. Through these, I saw the importance of continuous learning to obtain new knowledge and skills throughout our careers, especially in times of crisis. The pandemic might have had many businesses on the ropes, but it also inspired innovation and was a game-changer for the start-up ecosystem. I was motivated by the sector’s vibrancy and wanted to be a part of it. While it was difficult to give up what I had studied to pursue new pastures, I found that I could still fuel my passion for animals through volunteer work at animal shelters. I joined an online automotive marketplace in January 2021 to experience life in a start-up environment where people wear multiple hats. I picked up different skillsets and worked in cross-functional teams which exposed me to tech development. In July 2022, I enrolled in a part-time Bachelor in Information and Communications Technology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences to boost my knowledge of new technologies that connect the physical and digital worlds. At the same time, I was looking out for jobs that could complement my studies. That took me to Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme for Tech Professionals, specifically Red Alpha Cybersecurity's specialist training programme which provides classroom and on-the-job training for those who did not have relevant experience in cybersecurity, a lynchpin of the digital world. I left my previous workplace in March this year and joined Red Alpha in April as an Associate Cybersecurity Specialist to pick up new skills in areas such as penetration testing and network forensics. I am currently in the training phases of the programme and attending courses on hacker tools, techniques, incident handling as well as penetration testing, which is a simulated cyber attack to check for exploitable vulnerabilities, so that I can obtain relevant certifications and the requisite skillsets to be a practitioner in the industry. At the same time, I am able to tap a strong network of cybersecurity practitioners made up of instructors, industry mentors and Red Alpha alumni, and that has helped to accelerate my learning and made the transition more manageable. Working in a start-up previously required creative problem solving and active communications, and I found that these soft skills were also applicable in the cybersecurity field. Switching from a career path fueled by the passion I had since young to one that was shaped by a more pragmatic approach wasn’t easy. It was a heavy decision to make as I had to commit both money and time to it. The learning curve has been steep especially since I have to learn an entirely new set of skills, but I know that I have to work extra hard to be successful. Technologies are ever-changing, and thus those who excel are people who can adapt and learn as they progress in their careers. ABOUT THE WRITER: Elroy Xu Minjie, 27, is an animal lover who wanted a career aligned with his passion. Today, he is pursuing a brand new career path in cybersecurity through Workforce Singapore’s Career Conversion Programme.

Chang Xue Qi The author is a centre supervisor at All Saints Home. The fast-changing nature of work has prompted many Singaporeans to upgrade their skills to stay relevant. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singaporeans who have recently done so to give their careers a boost, or even pursue new paths in life. In this instalment, Ms Chang Xue Qi, 28, describes the challenges of being the youngest supervisor at a senior daycare centre — especially when dealing with staff. On top of picking up people management skills on the job, Ms Chang is also pursuing a master’s degree in applied gerontology to better serve her elderly clients. Chang Xue Qi Published August 13, 2023 Updated October 24, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn My career in the eldercare sector began in February 2018, when I volunteered with the Silver Generation Office (SGO), the outreach arm of the Agency for Integrated Care. My grandmother sparked my interest in caring for the elderly. She was an instrumental figure in my growing-up years, having left her job as a factory worker to look after me when I was born. Through her, I learnt values such as empathy and compassion. I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2018, with an honours degree in political science. Inspired by my grandmother, my honours thesis was about improving the effectiveness of policy communications to the elderly. I joined SGO full-time in July 2018. There, I actively reached out to seniors and their caregivers to assist them with various government schemes and policies. That sparked my interest to learn more about ageing issues, so I took up a part-time specialist diploma in gerontology at Temasek Polytechnic in October 2020. It was difficult juggling work and study commitments. Blessed with supportive family members, lecturers, classmates and colleagues, I managed to graduate in May 2022 and was the valedictorian for my cohort. It is one of the proudest moments in my working life. Before graduating, I was offered the opportunity to manage the All Saints Home in Yishun, which is a nursing home that also provides day care and other services for seniors, but I was unsure if I could be a good supervisor. However, my current boss encouraged me to try interviewing for the job. To my delight, I was accepted and started work in March 2022. I was, and still am, the youngest supervisor in my organisation. Managing a daycare centre is an uphill task. I could communicate well with seniors, but it is a different ball game with staff. I had to learn people management and communication skills on the job. For example, when I receive complaints about staff behaviour, I need to tactfully speak to those concerned about it. Many of them are senior staff who are much older than me. I often spend time thinking about the right words and body language to convey my message, so that I can strike a balance between correcting misbehaviour and keeping staff motivated. All this happened as I was starting my part-time master’s degree in applied gerontology at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in August 2022. I felt that this programme was a natural progression from my diploma, as it could equip me with skills and knowledge to better serve the elderly. If all goes well, I should graduate in July 2024. My family is my pillar of support; they unconditionally allowed me to pursue my aspirations and even offered to fund my studies. They did not have to do so, as I later secured a full tuition scholarship from Ngee Ann Kongsi, which I’m deeply grateful for. Juggling my new job and the master’s is definitely challenging. I have to sacrifice my weekends to study. On weekday nights after work, I rush to NTU for my classes — a nerve-racking journey due to traffic. Nevertheless, I enjoy my classes. My favourite module so far is leadership and management in aged care, where I learnt about strategic management and various personality types. I now understand why people behave in certain ways, and how I can fine-tune my communications with them. It is both rewarding and challenging managing a team of 14 staff, with vastly different ages and backgrounds. Working in an elderly-dominated environment has also trained me to be mature and tactful in handling difficult situations. Being a supervisor, I’ve learnt to be less task-oriented, and instead focus on engaging staff and caring about their well-being. This was a paradigm shift from my previous SGO job, but surely and slowly, I am learning to empathise with my staff more. My boss once said he wanted to pay it forward by mentoring me, because he benefited from his own experience. I aspire to do the same too. My advice to people embarking on a similar journey? There is no fixed age to being a leader or supervisor. With the right mentorship and a positive learning attitude, you can make it.

TODAY readers weigh in The issue of car ownership amid skyrocketing Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums was hotly debated by TODAY readers this week, after a recent Big Read shone the spotlight on why people still buy cars in Singapore. Here's a selection of comments. TODAY file photo Published October 18, 2023 Updated June 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn The issue of car ownership amid skyrocketing Certificate of Entitlement (COE) premiums was hotly debated by TODAY readers this week. In TODAY’s Big Read series last weekend, car dealers, owners and industry observers shared their views on why people still buy cars in Singapore, and how the market has responded to help consumers. Readers were divided over the issue, with many saying that families with young children or the elderly should be entitled to own a car. Others disagreed, saying that Singapore’s public transport system was sufficient, while some suggested changes to the COE system to bring down prices. Here's a selection of comments: FAMILIES NEED CARS COEs should be allocated based on need, not affordability. Families with children or (the) elderly should be entitled to own one family sedan (not a luxurious continental car) without the need to pay for COE. A basic car for a family should be treated like a HDB flat. The current formula based solely on affordability is twisted — those who are well-off can own multiple cars… even though such individuals don't need it; or those using the car for business, such as private hires. HO YEW CHIN If you're out without your kids and it starts raining, you'll find it hard to get a cab or PHV (private hire vehicle). Now if you have one kid with you, your pool of options lessens because you either have to call a standard cab or the PHV family version. If you have more than one kid with you, getting a family PHV with multiple child seats is challenging and your pool of options drastically reduces. Of course, you can always take public transport, which comes with its own set of challenges depending how old your kids are. JAN TAN Sometimes, we families with small kids would love to travel via public transport, but our fellow commuters are something else. Lifts meant for the elderly and prams are all filled up with abled(-bodied) people who don’t bat an eyelid to those in need. On buses, people stand at the area where prams are supposed to be parked… Our transport system is excellent. It’s the users who are lacking EQ and IQ. NOURA YUSOFF I’ve got a 76-year-old mum and 93-year-old grandma. Every Sunday I take them out for dinner which (makes them) very happy. I occasionally take them to the supermarket to buy groceries. That’s how important owning a car is. The Government should make it affordable for all families to own their first car. Those who buy a second car should be made to pay higher. GOH KHENG LENG “ Families with kids aged 12 and below should have a 50 per cent COE rebate to encourage population growth, like the baby bonus. RICHARD GRAYSON ” CAR NOT NECESSARY I die die won't buy a car because our transport system is good. Point to point, no need to fight or wait for parking, kena (get) summon, (pay) road tax, insurance… and season parking. Taxi, Grab and others, reach destination, open door (and) walk, which is so convenient. ROY TANG My parents and their parents, together with my uncles and aunties’ generations, did not have a car when they were bringing up their families. It can be done, in fact brings you much closer to your children than being a driver. CALVIN YO Times have changed. Do not live the way our fathers have lived on this land. This is now a modern city, live like a city dweller. If you insist on owning a car in a city, it is an extravagance you must be prepared to pay for. Weekend rental or car-pooling is another alternative over public transport. TAN FAITH In Singapore, driving or riding is actually not considered a \"leisure ride\" since our country is small. So many traffic lights too… even if you pay for ERP (Electronic Road Pricing), you can still be stuck in a traffic jam. YUJIN TAN Ultimately, we must recognise that a car is still a luxury rather than a necessity (even for those who really need it), regardless of which angle you look at it, and that affordability is not something we can solve for. CHENG FEI CHANGE THE SYSTEM? The answer lies in the satellite-based ERP system, which is long overdue… When the new ERP system can control the usage of roads at an optimum level… it could result in the Government being able to release more COEs for each monthly bidding. Car ownership does not cause traffic congestion. It is the use of cars on the roads at the same time that causes traffic jams. TAN KOK TIM “ Private hire cars should not fall under the normal COE category. They should be under a commercial-use category. LANCE BERNARD GOH ” Separate the COE for families and (those) that need a car to make a living. Those who own more than one family car (should be) considered a luxury COE. PETER LEE A Catch-22 situation. A better public transport system needs higher ridership to be cost effective. Higher ridership means more crowding, more inconvenience, especially during peak hours… More taxis, more PHVs, higher COEs, higher fares, more traffic, more congestion, more unproductive. Higher COEs also push up other transport costs. There must be a balance. The system needs an overhaul. If our infrastructure cannot support the bulging population growth, slow it down.

Sophia Lee Published November 12, 2023 Updated December 28, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I have been a housekeeper at various hotels in Malaysia and Singapore for 14 years and counting. My first housekeeping stint was at a hotel in Ipoh, Malaysia, in 2010. I was earning my diploma in Hospitality Management at Keris College and had to complete an internship with a hotel before graduation. It was my introduction to the world of housekeeping, at a time without much technology. Back then, room attendants had to carry and consult extensive paperwork when cleaning, particularly for VIP rooms. Updating the room cleaning report was a manual task, as was the meticulous counting of soiled linen — a far cry from the electronic systems used today. That internship laid a strong foundation in housekeeping for me, and I fell in love with the job because it allowed me to be on my feet and be actively engaged. Plus, I also had a passion for crafting exceptional experiences for guests. Since then, I continued to hone my skills at various hotels, including my current role at Village Hotel Bugis, where I have been based since 2017. A typical workday starts with a team line-up during which we will need to meticulously discuss room assignments, special guest requests, and any specific details requiring our attention. Our primary focus is to ensure that our guests feel welcomed and have a great stay. My responsibilities include overseeing cleaning schedules, conducting quality assessments, and managing inventory to ensure things operate seamlessly. Like many service industry roles, housekeeping has its unique set of challenges. A significant one is adapting to guests’ ever-changing demands. I recall an instance where a guest reported an issue with their room's air-conditioning moments after checking in. Upon inspection, it turned out that the system required some time to reach the desired temperature, which is normal. Unfortunately, the guest was impatient. Recognising the situation, I immediately asked my colleagues to expedite the cooling process in another room and contacted the duty manager to switch the guest to the room that was already cooled. Within a few minutes, the issue was resolved, and the guest appreciated our prompt response. What I find most rewarding about my work is the immediate satisfaction derived from the positive feedback from our guests on their stay. Though we are the “ninjas” behind the scenes, we know that housekeeping plays an important role. My team and I are always looking to enhance the guest experience with us. Once in 2018, I had the idea to create a kid-themed room. We got excited and we spent time getting creative. It involved hours of wall painting, decorations, and carefully choosing suitable furniture for the theme. A week later, we unveiled our room. The reaction from our guests exceeded our expectations, and demand for these rooms skyrocketed. Families were booking them months in advance, and compliments poured in. It will always be a reminder to me how innovation can enhance our guests’ experience, which makes the job exciting for me! For aspiring housekeepers, I recommend that you start by taking a role to build your foundation. There are many skills that are essential for housekeeping, such as attention to detail, effective time management, and good communication. Specific training is also vital so that we can uphold high standards of cleanliness, safety, and guest satisfaction. I have gone through such training myself, for example Workforce Skills Qualifications in areas such as cleaning and sanitation, and workplace safety and health. Despite this, hotel housekeeping is a profession that may not always receive the recognition it deserves. It is not uncommon for family and friends to misunderstand the challenges and dedication that this line of work demands. My friends sometimes make playful remarks about me \"helping guests wash toilet bowls”. However, I take immense pride in what I do and am always quick to respond that I can even draw a proper toilet bowl, as I've seen quite a few in my career. The essence of our work goes far beyond cleaning. It revolves around creating memorable and joyous experiences for our guests, and requires dedication, adaptability, and a profound passion for hospitality.

Charles Lee Published November 19, 2023 Updated March 1, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn My interest in the automotive industry started when I was eight. My father, a professional mechanic, would perform “magic” whenever he fired up a car engine that could not start. It fascinated me to no end. By the time I turned 16, I was already helping out at his workshop during the December school holidays. I learnt to change engine oil and replace tyres. As I grew older, I was taught basic diagnosis skills. Fast forward to 2015. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. I got a job as a procurement engineer dealing with made-to-order parts and later, worked at a company that fabricated aerobridges. I have always maintained an interest in joining the automotive industry. When I saw my family members struggling with the physical demands of the job as they got older, I decided to take the plunge. In 2016, I started taking a part-time Nitec in Automotive Technology at Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College West. My father was initially not keen on the move, asking me why I was studying at ITE when he had sent me to university. However, I went ahead because I wanted to get the technical knowledge required to help him and the family business. I graduated with a Certificate of Merit one-and-a-half years later. Recognising a gap in my knowledge about high voltage vehicles, I also enrolled in an Institute of Motor Industry course in Penang in 2018. There, I learnt how to safely handle high voltage automotive systems. That same year, I joined Hyundai distributor Komoco Motors and stayed there for three years as an automotive engineer. I had the opportunity to travel to Korea to see technologies and receive training for vehicles that are not found in Singapore. Being an engineer can be quite taxing physically. During my training at Komoco, I was required to help take down and do a solo repair on a double clutch gearbox. At about 90kg, it was probably the heaviest load that I have ever carried. However, an experienced mechanic told me how and where to use my body strength to do the repair without hurting myself. That came in handy in learning how to handle heavy loads. I did a short stint with a Chinese battery company, before joining my family’s business in 2022. Over time, my father accepted that my knowledge can improve customer experience, reduce costs to customers and improve our technology use. For example, I helped to digitise all our invoices and expenses. This allowed us to quickly find our customers’ records. We now know what was last done to their car, how much was charged, and how frequently a customer visits us. In turn, that gives us the freedom to offer appropriate discounts. My family agrees too that it is time that I take on the responsibility to keep the business going. Fortunately, I find this trade very interesting. My job involves helping out with repairs while managing diagnostics and marketing. A typical day starts when a vehicle comes in with an issue. I will diagnose the issue to determine the type of repairs required and get the required parts. A common challenge I face is deciding on the right repairs for a vehicle while ensuring the customer’s budget is met. Sometimes, work and parts that look easy may be deceptively difficult. However, I get satisfaction from learning the quirks of different vehicles and helping someone’s day turn from bad to good. I also take pride in helping workers upskill. One of my proudest moments was when I successfully guided a worker through a complicated gearbox repair which he had never done before. I feel my own unique background and experience will help the family business smoothly pivot to electric vehicles. Hopefully, with external investment, we can eventually be a dealer for green vehicles. If I ever have kids who want to follow in my footsteps, my advice to them would be to get industry experience to build up their reputation and credibility, embrace new technologies and always do the right thing for the customers that put their faith in you.

Eric Ng Jun Wei Published November 26, 2023 Updated December 28, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn My innate love for art since young is the reason why I am an airbrush artist today. As a child, my eyes would light up at the sight of colours, and I spent hours with crayons, filling every piece of paper I could find. My aunt knew that something extraordinary was happening when I started sketching detailed scenes on paper. She then started to sign me up for drawing competitions. I remember getting third place in one at the age of five. I did not have the opportunity to study art or drawing as my family did not think it was a promising career, but I continued to draw in my free time. I graduated from ITE (Dover) with a Higher Nitec in information technology in 2001 and completed a diploma in sound and audio engineering at SAE Creative Media Institute in 2004. I then got a job as a video editor with a local media production company. During my employment, I chanced upon videos about “Orange County Choppers”, an American company which specialises in custom-built motorcycles, and started to gain interest in airbrush painting. Out of curiosity, I bought an airbrush painting starter kit and started picking up skills via YouTube. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY Airbrush artist Eric Ng at his store, Paint Extreme, on Nov 2, 2023. My passion for airbrush painting grew. I attempted to start a small business and began painting motorbikes for some friends. One of my clients was from Yew Heng Group, a local auto dealer, who saw my potential. I gradually started a partnership with Yew Heng Group to set up Paint Extreme in 2010. Today, I have two staff members under me. The bulk of our business comes from painting bicycle frames and racing helmets. We also paint items such as sculptures and various 3D-printed objects. Airbrush painting is painstaking work. The process begins with preparation, which includes sanding off old paint and spraying primer onto the object. Colours are then mixed according to the client’s preference, and the object is masked with tape before painting. Airbrush artistry demands an acute eye for detail and a steady hand, as artists delicately manipulate colours, shading and gradients to create stunning visual effects. It is not just about evenly coating surfaces with paint; it’s about achieving exceptional finishes, protecting against corrosion, and enhancing aesthetics. Depending on the design, I may use a small or big air-powered tool to accurately apply paint while adjusting for different materials and conditions. I then do a quality check before spraying the topcoat. Drying takes approximately 48 hours before a second round of checks is done. Should there be any blemishes, I will fine-sand the object and polish it to achieve the optimal finishing. It is then ready for delivery or collection. Success did not come easy. I dove into research and development to obtain the ideal paint quality for my clients, struggling to find paints which suited the humid weather in Southeast Asia. I brainstormed about how to fulfil my clients’ design requests. I also never stopped experimenting with different mediums — from acrylic to oil-based paint — to achieve different finishes ranging from single shades to multicoloured “chameleon” effects. I believe I have explored and learnt tremendously throughout my 17-year career. One significant achievement would be the opportunity to complete a project for the Malaysian royal family in 2019, which won me many repeat clients. Another would be collaborating with Mr Jahan Loh, a contemporary artist based in Singapore. Jahan designed and I painted a helmet for local singer JJ Lin. We also collaborated on another helmet for beer brand Heineken at the 2017 Singapore Grand Prix. In 2019, indoor skydiving company GoAirborne Macau contacted me to paint helmets for their crew. It was also a privilege to paint the helmet for Singaporean racing driver Yuey Tan in 2022. I am thankful that my family is very supportive of my career and in future I hope to be able to gain more international recognition for my work. For anyone who is interested in entering the airbrush painting industry, the most important aspect is to have passion and creativity. Also, do not take any shortcuts to reduce the time taken to complete a project — quality is of the utmost importance. ABOUT THE WRITER: Eric Ng Jun Wei, 41, is a professional airbrush artist.

Jay Teo Junxiang Published December 3, 2023 Updated December 28, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I studied electronic and computer engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic. During that period, I was a part-time cook at Fish & Co. My parents were not keen on me joining the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry as they saw how tiring it was, but I enjoyed the camaraderie in the kitchen and wanted to try out the job. I graduated in 2011 and after National Service enrolled in a Workforce Skills Qualifications diploma in food services (culinary arts) at Shatec. My mum encouraged me, despite knowing it would be tough — she knew how stubborn I was! In 2015, near the end of my course, I applied for the 8th Spanish Gastronomy Training Programme offered by the Spanish government. I got selected and was off to Valladolid, northwest Spain, for six months after graduating. We spent the first three months studying the Spanish language and cuisine. We were also attached to Tapas restaurants and worked there after school, including our off days. I was placed at a tapas bar called Villa Paramesa Tapas. It was challenging working from 6pm until closing. Sometimes we ended at 2am, but serving 200-300 people a night was satisfying, especially with just four in the kitchen. The next three months, I interned at one-star Michelin restaurant La Botica de Matapozuelos, near Valladolid. We would pick herbs from the back garden. Sometimes we foraged for berries or visited the farm at our chef’s home to catch chickens and harvest vegetables. It was a chef’s dream come true. We ended the stint with a competition to create a tapa dish, and I won. For the first time, I felt I was good at something. I returned to Singapore fully intending to work in Spain. Shortly after, chef Rishi Naleendra, who started Cheek by Jowl restaurant at Boon Tat Street, invited me for an interview. I had always wanted to visit him as he, too, had interned at La Botica. I joined his restaurant in 2016 while waiting for an opening in Spain. That year, the famed Michelin guide launched in Singapore. Chef Rishi asked if I could stay and help the restaurant achieve a star, and I agreed. We managed to do that in 2017. It is still one of my proudest moments. We kept the star for three years. During that time, I rose from commis chef to head chef in 2018. In 2019, we rebranded as Cheek Bistro and I stayed until end-2020 — the year Covid-19 hit. I had gotten engaged that year and wanted a change. Shatec had offered me a training instructor role and my fiancee and I agreed that I should accept it. We got married the year after. As an instructor, I truly enjoyed spending time with my students, but I still longed for the kitchen. So, I sold homemade char siew tarts, cookies and fish stuffed with laksa paste on my off days. I also created my own brand, FullCircle by J.man — a nickname Chef Rishi gave me. I found a business partner and left Shatec to set up FullCircle as a pop-up restaurant at Thye Hong Centre on Leng Kee Road. It operated from August 2022 to August 2023. I was happy to showcase my own cooking style. But there were challenges — from staff shortages to poor sales because of our location. After a year, the partnership ended. I took a break to refresh myself mentally. What I’ve learned from this experience is that it’s okay to fail and know when to stop. It was not an easy pill to swallow, but a necessary one. Things are looking up. In November, I entered another tapas competition in Spain and placed fifth out of 16 international contestants. In future, I plan on opening a Singapore-style tapas restaurant. My parents are proud of my achievements, and they tell their friends about me. My wife has grown to understand and support my work. She’s the backbone of our family, taking care of our two-year-old boy on top of her job as a teacher. I believe that to thrive in the F&B industry you must love both the good and bad. If you realise you only love cooking, then keep it as a hobby.

Be aware of the pitfalls I refer to the article “Funeral industry encouraged to provide greater price transparency, clarity on packages” (Nov 17). Unsplash Bernard Chen Jiaxi Published December 8, 2023 Updated December 8, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I refer to the article “ Funeral industry encouraged to provide greater price transparency, clarity on packages ” (Nov 17). A report by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) last month highlighted the lack of transparency over funeral costs in Singapore. It also encouraged consumers to pre-plan funeral arrangements where possible. The main selling point of pre-paid funerals is that you can plan them to your preferences, without the emotional pressure of dealing with a loved one’s death. However, given Singaporeans’ general unfamiliarity with the funeral business, as pointed out by the CCCS report, it might be wiser not to make pre-plans unless certain safeguards are put in place. First, a central registry of pre-paid funeral contracts should be established to enable consumers, family members and funeral directors to expeditiously verify the details of existing contracts. Individual funeral service providers should also be required to keep records of pre-paid funerals. As a former funeral professional, I have encountered many occasions when a person died and their family members were not aware that a plan existed. A 2005 parliamentary inquiry on the funeral industry in Victoria, Australia, found that its system of self-regulation was “unsatisfactory” given the diversity of businesses and lack of agreed industry-wide standards. It added that a voluntary code of practice would not be beneficial without the “support of legislation”. Recommendations from the inquiry have been enshrined in law since 2006. In Singapore, where almost every funeral company is a small or medium-sized enterprise, pre-paid funds meant for future use could well be spent on existing costs. One also cannot rule out the possibility that a firm might exit the business before a package can be used. As such, monies paid in advance for funeral packages should be placed in an independent investment trust fund, which a funeral director cannot access until the death has occurred. The interest earned from an investment fund could also be used to fund funerals for the destitute. While pre-planning does allow consumers to make informed decisions, the continual lack of transparency in funeral costs remains a barrier in that decision-making process. Thus, unless the authorities make it mandatory that prices of funeral goods and services are made transparent and itemised and shared with consumers before a contract is signed, there is a distinct imbalance in favour of an unregulated industry. Such safeguards could be legalised under the ambit of a “Funeral Act”, to govern the entire industry. Presently, if one’s concern is the cost of a funeral, it is better to deposit funds in a nominated bank account rather than with a funeral company. Consumers can also consider listing out detailed ideas about a funeral in a will after having consulted a funeral firm. This will allow them to reap the benefits of a pre-paid funeral without the drawbacks of being locked into a contract that might eventually not be honoured.

Muhammad Aliff Adha Published December 10, 2023 Updated March 1, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn When I tell people I work at Hyundai, they assume that I work in a car workshop. But after explaining that I assemble electric vehicles (EVs) using robots in a smart factory, their interest is piqued. I’m proud to say that I’m part of the Korean company’s only EV manufacturing team in Singapore. I wouldn’t be where I am today, if not for my parents’ advice and a supportive learning environment. When I was in secondary school, I was disappointed when my N-Level results weren’t good enough for me to progress to Secondary 5. My only option then was the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). I wasn’t keen, but with my parents’ advice, I applied for an engineering course at the former Bukit Batok campus in 2007. I had difficulty adapting to ITE initially. Thankfully, my lecturers were very patient, guiding me in my lessons and believing that I can do well in my studies. I soon found out that I enjoyed engineering and hands-on learning. I graduated from my Nitec in Precision Engineering (Machining) in 2009 with a perfect grade point average, and was offered an Economic Development Board (EDB) Scholarship to join the Technical Engineer Diploma (TED) in Machine Technology at ITE. I accepted without hesitation. Though the TED course was more theoretical, the lecturers were very supportive and worked tirelessly to ensure that I understood what was being taught. This motivated me to do my best. In 2011, I topped my TED cohort and received a Gold Course Medal. My career journey started in 2014 soon after I completed my National Service. I found out that jet engine-maker Rolls-Royce Singapore was willing to accept fresh graduates from ITE. I applied and was accepted in January 2014. I started out as an assembly technician for commercial aircraft engines. Then, the Covid-19 pandemic hit. The aviation sector was badly affected, and I was retrenched in August 2021, after 7.5 years. That was the lowest point of my career. Fortunately, just before the retrenchment exercise, my TED lecturer contacted me and told me there was a career opportunity in Hyundai. I jumped at the chance and was given the role as a senior assembly technician in September 2021. As part of the pioneer batch, I was sent to Daegu, South Korea for three months of training. There, I learnt how to assemble EVs. Being in a smart factory was mind-blowing. I had to work alongside robots and use smart technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things. Working with robots is not as straightforward as one might think. I have to ensure that these high-tech machines are working well during production and that all parts are delivered on time to each step on the assembly line. This was quite challenging for me at first as I was used to manual work from my previous job. I had to ensure that I was familiar enough with the robots so I could figure out what the issue was when an error occurred. Then I would rectify it, move the robot to its starting position and restart the process. I also needed to do this quickly enough to minimise delays. Thankfully, Hyundai provided me with intensive training on how to do basic troubleshooting. Once I got the hang of it, I enjoyed and appreciated the integration of technology in the assembly process. It excites me every time I see how the robots assemble cars. It feels like I’m stepping into a different world! Instead of humans, we have robots moving car components around and assembling them. This greatly reduces our workload and improves productivity. Once completed, these newly assembled cars can be test-driven at the 620m-long track located on the rooftop. After 1.5 years, I was promoted to production supervisor. My duties now include ensuring that the production line runs smoothly and manpower planning. I am learning new things every day, and in future I hope to leverage my technical skills to come up with ideas on new technologies, improve existing ones and drive innovation. No doubt, robots can perform certain tasks better than humans, but tasks that require critical thinking and interpersonal skills will always require a human touch. ABOUT THE WRITER: Muhammad Aliff Adha, 33, is a production supervisor at Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Center Singapore. He has nearly 10 years of manufacturing experience in both the aviation and automotive industries.

Makesvary Krishnasamy Published December 17, 2023 Updated December 28, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn When I was younger, I wanted to help people and thought I would pursue a career in social services. Now, I help plants instead! I am a landscape supervisor at BNL Services, an environmental services company which provides landscape, cleaning, and waste management services. My team and I look after and inspect the trees and plants at Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Wonders. A typical day will see me check various trees for defects which might lead to falling branches, or even the whole tree. Once a defect has been spotted, I would need to rectify it. For example, if I spot dead branches on a tree, I will get my team to remove them. I love looking after plants and trees and I truly enjoy my work. It wasn’t always like this, though. My N-Level results weren’t great and of the 12 courses I listed in my ITE application, a Nitec in Urban Greenery & Landscape was my last choice. As fate would have it, it was the course I got into at ITE College East. I entered the course in 2018, having no idea what it would be like. By actively participating in class and horticultural activities organised by the school and industry, I slowly developed an interest. Having spent time outdoors and figuring out what makes plants tick, I discovered that, “Hey, it’s fun working with plants!”. My lecturer also played a big part in my career choice. Her passion for plants really inspired me — she was the one who showed me how important plants are. She gave me a lot of support while I was studying and created more opportunities for me to gain exposure and build my network in the landscaping industry. My family was surprised when they found out about my interest. They definitely didn’t expect me to be a plant lover since I wasn’t exposed much to nature when I was younger. Once they got used to the idea, they supported my decision to turn this interest into a career. Now, they are proud and happy that I choose to do what I love. After graduating from my Nitec course, I enrolled in the newly-introduced ITE Work-Study Diploma (WSDip) in Arboriculture & Horticulture in 2020. That was when I joined BNL Services. Lim Li Ting/TODAY Ms Makesvary Krishnasamy found it a challenge to work with people of varying field experiences as a young trainee, but she worked hard to prove herself. Stepping into the work environment as a young trainee, I found it a challenge to work with people of varying field experiences. But I took my time to learn from everyone. I worked hard to prove my capabilities and made sure I bonded with my team so we could all learn from each other. The WSDip course taught me more than just technical knowledge and skills. It also prepared me for the working world by teaching me how to interact with people from different age groups. This particular skillset keeps things interesting for me as well — I meet many people with diverse talents and perspectives in this industry and I really enjoy it. It gives me an opportunity to work with and learn from them. I may work with plants, but there is plenty of human interaction as well! I stayed on with BNL after completing my WSDip in 2022. I’m grateful to the company for giving me the opportunity to kick start my career in this industry. A highlight of my career so far was getting the chance to represent BNL and showcase the National Parks Board’s digitalisation capabilities to National Development Minister Desmond Lee at this year’s Green Thumbs exhibition. I know many girls would prefer not to pursue a career like mine. In this line, you can’t be afraid of working outdoors. As for me, I love being outside and bugs don’t bother me at all. Tree falls happen more frequently during the rainy season, so you’ve got to be prepared to work in the rain too. Personally, I prefer working without a raincoat as I find them quite restrictive. My love for nature goes beyond enjoying beautiful scenery. To me, plants and trees are living things, just like us. So instead of serving humans, I choose to serve plants and trees, despite having to do so under the hot sun for hours. ABOUT THE WRITER: Makesvary Krishnasamy, 22, is a landscape supervisor at BNL Services. Though she is just starting out in the industry, she hopes to be a plant and tree specialist in the future. She is currently pursuing a certified arborist licence with the International Society of Arboriculture. At home, she is “mum” to a growing collection of money plants.

Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Ms Kelly Cheah, 31, recounts her unconventional journey from aspiring engineer to head pastry chef at an award-winning cafe. Initially lukewarm about baking, she fell in love with creating pastries and rose up the kitchen ranks, overcoming challenges along the way. Kelly Cheah Published December 24, 2023 Updated December 24, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Despite being a science student and aspiring to follow my father's footsteps as an engineer, my education took an unexpected turn when I ventured into pastry-making. It was not an easy decision, especially when most people wanted to be doctors, lawyers, or engineers. I was young at the time, and rather than follow a prescribed path, I wanted to try something different. If it didn’t work out, at least I would have no regrets. My dad, who has always been very supportive of me, suggested that since I love to eat, why not learn how to bake? So, after my SPM exams in Malaysia (the equivalent of the O-Levels) in 2009, I took a gap year to travel around Asia to figure out my next move. To be honest, I didn’t have a huge passion for baking at first, but I did want to get a diploma. I went to several pastry schools in Singapore to enquire, but as a foreigner then, it was not cheap to study and stay here. In the end, I chose Shatec because it is a well-known institute, and the fees were more affordable. After starting my diploma course in pastry and baking in 2011, I discovered a love for the art of pastries. I enjoy creating beautiful and delicious desserts to complement a good meal. I graduated in 2012 and started as a commis chef at French restaurant DB Bistro & Oyster Bar at Marina Bay Sands that year. It was my first time in a professional kitchen. I was taught the importance of being curious and asking “why”. I learned this the hard way when I was reprimanded for not knowing the reasons behind my actions and just going through the motions. I also mastered the art of working quickly, as DB Bistro often faced intense rushes during festive seasons. This taught me to multitask and to stay composed even in the face of demanding chefs. The experience prepared me for the high-pressure kitchen at Joel Robuchon Restaurant, which I joined in 2014. There, I delved into the intricacies of French cuisine. I started as a commis 1 chef before being promoted to demi chef in 2015 and later chef de partie in 2016. As all the recipes were in French, reading them became an endeavour that not only expanded my culinary repertoire but also my linguistic abilities. I was entrusted with managing desserts and the petit four trolleys, which comprised over 20 bite-sized and classic French desserts that had to be prepared before dinner service began. In 2018, I joined Tarte by Cheryl Koh, a small takeaway shop at Shaw Centre that I helped transform into an award-winning pastry haven. I have been Tarte’s head pastry chef since January 2022. Balancing the demands of haute cuisine with the challenges of building a brand has been both daunting and immensely rewarding. My day starts at 7am, working in the kitchen to complete morning preparations with my team. Then, I ensure the dining area is ready for guests. I experiment with new desserts every week — regardless of whether they are intended for public release. This commitment to innovation remains a pivotal part of my role. We also take pride in using premium ingredients. I could be working with shine muscat grapes from Korea one day and sollies figs from France the next. I believe this approach is what makes our kitchen a culinary hub. On top of that, I'm learning how to manage and make the brand profitable. I've had to delve into budgeting and balance sheets, which were unfamiliar concepts when I was just a chef. Leading a team and earning their respect is a new skill I'm also developing. At Tarte, I must interact with guests, suppliers, and my colleagues, and this journey is teaching me the art of effective communication. As for my dad, he is very proud that I didn’t give up halfway and continued with my pastry journey. To aspiring pastry chefs, my advice is to embrace challenges, relish the joy of discovery, seek mentorship, and cultivate a love for the craft. Remember, every setback is a stepping stone to triumph. Bon Appetit! ABOUT THE WRITER: Kelly Cheah, 31, is a Penang native who became a Singapore Permanent Resident in 2017. She is head pastry chef at Tarte by Cheryl Koh, and enjoys pilates, yoga and checking out cafes and restaurants whenever she can.

Nuria Ling/TODAY Ms Tsuri Xie is a vinyl installer at Vos Automotive Styling. Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Ms Tsuri Xie, 34, recounts her career transition from a marketing job to installing vinyl wraps on cars. Drawn to the creative process, she picked up skills and managed to win fans on social media by sharing videos of her work. Negative comments, as well as chauvinism from those who think women know little about cars, don’t discourage her from pursuing her craft, she writes. Tsuri Xie Published December 31, 2023 Updated December 31, 2023 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts with a Communication Design degree in 2010. As a student, I envisioned myself entering the creative or media industry. I found myself in marketing instead, and after some years landed a senior role in an international company. Despite the attractive compensation, nothing quite satisfied the itch to create. Along the way, I began investing in startups. In 2016, I invested in a now defunct automotive company called Fox Motorworks. That was where I first encountered vinyl wrapping, and the process intrigued me. I began playing around with scrap vinyl material, but not very seriously because it was a lot harder than it looked. Amid the pandemic in 2020, I left my job to set up a digital marketing firm. The founders of my current workplace, Vos Automotive, approached me then to join them as a marketer. It was a bold move for me, but the opportunity was a breath of fresh air. Shortly after, I closed my venture and joined Vos as a founding member. Like many businesses, we found it hard to hire skilled labour. This was my chance to start learning vinyl wrapping more seriously. At the end of 2020, I spoke to Vos’ owners about becoming a vinyl wrap installer. They gave me their blessing. I began by watching online videos and referencing those techniques against what other seasoned installers were teaching me. I also joined online communities where professional installers share tips with one another. That same year, I started recording videos myself at work for my own review. A friend suggested uploading them onto TikTok. I didn’t think too much of it but did it anyway. Before long, they grew in popularity, garnering millions of views. This gave me the assurance to push myself further. There were also many negative comments, which would affect my mental state adversely, but I tried to take them constructively as much as possible. I enjoy seeing every car as a creative canvas. Initially, being able to even complete a job gave me an unparalleled sense of achievement. After wrapping professionally for three years — and completing over a hundred projects — a finished design is still extremely satisfying to me. Some of my more memorable designs include a graphic anime-styled wrap, a BMW 4 series wrapped in marble print and a Mercedes G-Wagon wrapped in faux leather vinyl. A typical day involves planning and measuring the materials used, cleaning, designing and installing. The schedule can be demanding, especially during peak seasons. Nuria Ling/TODAY Ms Tsuri Xie wrapping a Ferrari sports car with a vinyl sheet. Fortunately, I have a team to assist me. Many of my teammates are my teachers too. New methods are always being discovered. Making progress means being willing to learn — never become the old dog that can’t learn new tricks. Unfortunately, chauvinism is very real in the male-dominated automotive industry. I have encountered many people who assume that women know little about cars. I’ve found that I need to prove my worth in this industry, as some clients do not trust a woman to work on their vehicles. Creative work is challenging work. While we strive for perfection, anything handmade is hardly perfect. Sadly, not everyone appreciates this and can be overly demanding. Additionally, prejudice against blue-collared work exists in Singapore. I have experienced many white-collared professionals talking down to my team and I. In fact, some who acted like my close friends despised me for going into blue-collared work. There was much chatter about me when I entered this trade. This does not stop me from pursuing my passion. To me, every wrap is a work of art. Seeing a satisfied owner further assures me that my decision was worth it. I’m thankful for my friends and family who truly supported me. Today, these are the same people who are telling their friends now they know me personally. To those wanting to enter the trade, be prepared to work on your posture or end up getting endless backaches. Be warned, too, that it is not a financially rewarding trade — the business is hardly scalable and anyone looking to make a quick buck should turn away. Passion is the only thing that will keep your fire going.

Alfred Goh Jie Bin Published January 7, 2024 Updated January 7, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I have loved bicycles since young. Cycling meant freedom as money was hard to come by. I could get around without worrying about transport fares or timing. My father died in 1996 when I was 12. My mum had to work, and I took a part-time job as a banquet waiter to help with finances. I would finish late and was too tired for school the next day. As a result, I got retained in Secondary 2 and left school during my repeat year, when I was 15. My mum was disappointed, but the upside was that I was earning an income which gave us a better quality of life. I also had more time to hang around bicycle shops. Slowly, I learnt the ins and outs of the trade. I worked my way up from sales to become a bicycle mechanic in 2002. In 2010, after eight years in the business, I wanted to further my technical knowledge and shop managing skills. I signed up for courses at United Bicycle Institute, an American school for bicycle mechanics. I travelled to their Ashland, Oregon campus on my own dime. My three weeks there cost me around S$15,000, but I felt it was a worthwhile investment. I took a professional repair and shop operation course, followed by various advanced certificates. Before this, I had not travelled much other than visiting family in Malaysia. It was challenging getting used to staying in a lodging with the rest of my coursemates. During lessons, I also had to learn industry terms not commonly used in Singapore. Cooking, laundry, grocery shopping and house parties became my life for those weeks. Armed with new knowledge and skills, I returned to Singapore looking forward to growing my employer’s business. In 2011, I had the chance to manage their shop operations, but that was short-lived as they closed down two years later. With no education to depend on, I started exploring other options. I did odd jobs such as being a hotel houseman and guest service officer. In mid-2013, I saw an advertisement for a scuba diving apprenticeship, which piqued my interest. I joined a dive centre and worked my way up to become an instructor and later an equipment distribution manager. Sadly, I left in 2016 seeking a more stable and financially rewarding venture. I returned to the cycling world, joining up-and-coming shops. I was excited to be back knowing I had the skills and experience to take their business forward. Starting over was difficult, but I persevered. At that point, I was 33 and married. I wished I could do more. In 2019, I took a leap of faith and opened my own shop. To say that running a business is challenging would be an understatement. The struggles worsened when Covid-19 happened shortly after opening. Fortunately, the circuit breaker and border closures encouraged more people to start cycling. With more customers, I faced new challenges being a one-man operation. To my surprise, former co-workers and customers offered to help. Some had been financially hit and volunteered to do odd jobs. It was a small side income for them, but I was happy to help. With life mostly back to normal now, business is not as brisk as before. Returning customers and recommendations keep me afloat. I am not highly educated so running a small business is a constant challenge. I am lucky I have the support of family and friends whenever I stumble on complex issues such as legal matters. A typical day starts with replying customer messages. Wrench work follows, which takes up most of my time, but I do have one staff helping with odd jobs. My day ends with replying to more messages. Staying in touch is vital to get more business. More than two decades ago, I was just a kid cycling for fun. I am still in that world, but happy to be behind the counter. My advice to those looking to enter the industry is to have tenacity and be content. When I was younger, I used to envy others’ success but now I am much happier spending time with family and friends than trying to impress others.

Kwek Siew Bo Published January 14, 2024 Updated January 19, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I graduated with a diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2011 and planned to further my studies. My family, however, was struggling to make ends meet and could not afford university tuition fees. So, I joined the workforce straight after graduation to help support them. I was disappointed, but little did I realise that this would set me on a path to something meaningful and rewarding. As I was strongly inclined towards hands-on work in school, I started my career as a technician at Hewlett-Packard, working in a team responsible for producing printer heads. After my contract ended, I joined SMRT Trains in 2014 as an assistant engineer. Part of my role involved doing preventive and corrective maintenance. It involved tasks such as troubleshooting faults, replacing worn and defective parts, and periodic cleaning of equipment. Switching industries and adjusting to a new environment and demands was challenging initially. Fortunately, the company provided me with a six-month training programme to equip me with the skills necessary to perform my role. Leading a team of two technical officers proved challenging too, as effective communication with other teams was essential to support train service. Over time, I overcame these communication challenges by taking notes and clarifying with my supervisors and colleagues any areas I was unsure of to better understand how to perform the work competently. In 2017, I had the opportunity to help establish a new base of operations in the newly built Tuas Depot. I volunteered to be part of the pioneer trainborne signalling team there. Setting up a new depot was exhilarating. It involved installing new workspaces and workflows to commission trains with new Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) systems installed. Simply put, CBTC is a railway signalling system that uses telecommunications for train management and control. It is an upgrade from traditional fixed block signalling systems which detect trains in discrete sections of the track. Trains had to be retrofitted for the new system and I was involved in the commissioning of the equipment needed. I also ensured that it was properly installed and helped to test it to make sure it was functional. Every early morning, before the launch of the day’s train service, we needed to make sure there were sufficient serviceable trains. I was promoted last July to the position of deputy engineering maintenance manager and am now leading trainborne signalling and communications maintenance operations at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. I now supervise a team of assistant engineers and technical officers to manage train-related maintenance. Not only do I ensure that we have the resources required, I’m also responsible for their safety and welfare. I assist my team with the more complex faults that may require an experienced eye. I also provide recommendations to the management regarding train faults and recovery. This significant change in my life has opened doors to strengthen relationships with colleagues and build wide networks in the industry. My previous supervisor and I now work together as colleagues at the same professional level. It allowed me to attain a greater appreciation for the work my supervisors had done in the past and the challenges they faced. For those considering a career in the rail and public transport industries, I would say there is a world of diverse opportunities. My career in SMRT has enabled me to meet, interact and learn from professionals from various fields, including the Land Transport Authority, our signalling system supplier Thales, and other contractors. I’ve also had the chance to delve into the intricacies of operating new trains and acquire fresh skills that I was not acquainted with previously. I may not have been able to further my studies after graduating many years ago, but when I look back, I am glad it led me to this. There is never a dull moment, and the prospect of networking and continuously learning with professionals from different domains, knowing that at the end of the day, commuters are the ultimate beneficiaries with safe, reliable, and comfortable journeys, has made this job truly fascinating, meaningful and rewarding.

After seeing how blue-collar roles are in demand overseas, he says that they deserve the same recognition in Singapore. Ho Boon Ping Published January 21, 2024 Updated January 22, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn When I was young, I thought studies were not important and neglected them. Not surprisingly, my N-Level results were not great. While browsing through the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) website for courses I could apply for, it occurred to me that with Singapore being such a hot and humid country, we can’t live without air-conditioning. So I opted for a Nitec in Facility Technology (Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration), which I started in April 2010. During the course, I went on an exchange programme at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne, Australia, where I saw women and many locals in blue-collar jobs. I was even more surprised to hear that plumbers, electricians, and HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) technicians were in demand in Australia. It made me hope that such jobs can achieve the same level of recognition in Singapore. In May 2013, I started working for Stulz (Singapore) — a German air-conditioning services firm — as a service engineer. During my interview, I frankly told the hiring manager that I did not have much experience. He was more than willing to train me, so I got the job. There, I learnt a lot about computer room air-conditioning and how temperature, humidity and airflow can affect machine performance. Stulz also sent me to Hamburg, Germany, for a week of training at its headquarters. It was an eye-opening experience. There, I also noticed that many of their technicians are locals as well. I stayed on with Stulz for six years, during which I also completed a part-time Higher Nitec in Marine and Offshore Technology as well as a part-time diploma in Building Services and Fire Safety from Ngee Ann Polytechnic. In 2018, my sister was hospitalised for eight weeks due to a lung infection. She couldn’t work after that and had to depend on the family. That was when I started thinking about leaving my comfort zone to help take care of my sister. I didn’t plan much — I resigned in May 2019 to look after her and rest. It was then that I decided to set up my own business as I love hands-on work and going to different job locations. In December 2019, I started Comfort Cooling Services, which provides air-conditioning and repair services. Unfortunately, Covid-19 struck just two months later. During the lockdown, I did some freelance work in building and servicing to get by. From there, I slowly built my customer base. I had zero connections so it wasn’t until mid-2021 that I started getting regular clients. I know many people are sceptical when engaging contractors to service their air-conditioners. I told myself I had to build up a business that provides honest and quality service. My ITE lecturers taught me good installation work, and I used that to guide me while building my business. When my customers engage my services, I won’t push unnecessary add-ons such as topping up refrigerant gas annually. This is a common contractor suggestion that is not necessary as long as the air-conditioner is installed properly and working fine. A typical day will see me servicing air-conditioners at different locations and sometimes meeting new customers, who get to know of me through word-of-mouth. It’s very satisfying for me as I feel that I learn something new every day, even though I have been doing this for a while. My biggest challenge is having to get over my fear of heights, especially when I have customers in older Housing and Development Board flats with no air-conditioner ledge. I have to use a safety harness to climb out of the flat to check or top up the refrigerant. It gives me great satisfaction when my customers give me good feedback on my work, and when I manage to solve their air-conditioning problems. To me, machines can’t do a hands-on job like mine. You need to be able to think on your feet. I feel that there will be great demand for skilled workers (plumbers, electricians, HVAC technicians and so on), especially when fewer people are taking up such jobs. For those thinking of going into this line, have faith in your skill and do what you are happy with.

SHAWN LOW Published January 26, 2024 Updated January 26, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I was recently retrenched. This came as a shock to me as I had been in a senior leadership role for nearly three years and had brought in significant revenue for my employer — a global company in the creative industry. I was informed that the reason for my retrenchment was “financial challenges” and it was not a “reflection of my past performance or contributions”. I asked about severance benefits, and was told I would not be getting any because the company was “not in a financially healthy position”. I have appealed for a payout in line with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s recommendations — generally up to a months’ salary per year of service for employees who have served for at least two years — and am still waiting for a response. Retrenchment benefits are not enshrined in Singapore’s labour laws. As mentioned, MOM gives only broad guidelines. Any severance amount depends on what is provided for in one’s employment contract, or paid out of good will — not because of legislation. Sadly, my contract didn’t include any such provision. A friend urged me to speak with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management who referred me to the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices. Both officers who spoke with me were sympathetic but ultimately said the same thing my company’s Human Resources told me — that they can only point my company to best practices — and could not enforce anything. My story isn’t the only one. The recent high-profile retrenchments at Lazada and Google have exposed a weakness in Singapore’s labour laws, which experts acknowledge are geared towards supporting companies. In the case of Google, affected staff were luckily offered a package that was “comparable” to retrenchment benefits in the United States. In Lazada’s case, employees were offered two weeks’ salary per year of service. The Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union, which represents its workers, is pushing for more. For perspective, I’ve worked as a Singaporean in Britain and Australia. Both these countries do have workplace laws that protect employees in the event of retrenchment. In Australia for example, if you are made redundant, there is provision of at least four weeks’ pay if you have worked with a company for at least a year. In Britain, employees get a payout if they’ve been working for a company for two years or more. This ranges from half a week’s pay to one-and-a-half week’s pay per full year of work, depending on age. These practices give employees a safety net so that they can continue meeting financial obligations while searching for new jobs. As a country that has ambitions to be a regional business hub, I urge MOM to strengthen the legal protection for employees here. If we are unable to strike a fair balance in the employment relationship, I worry about how competitive we will be in attracting and retaining global talents.

Noel Ng Published January 28, 2024 Updated January 28, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn It has been 16 years since I first picked up a pair of hair scissors, and I’ve not looked back since. In secondary school, I wasn’t motivated in my studies and struggled to pass my exams. My best subject was Design & Technology. This made me consider doing something that was skills-based at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), instead of continuing with my O-Levels. A new hairdressing course at ITE College East caught my eye. At first, my parents were sceptical when I told them of my choice. They felt hairdressing was not a reputable industry and were worried for me. I explained to them the possibilities if I became a successful hairstylist, and they relented. Having seen how far I’ve come, I think they are relieved that I’m doing well. I started my Nitec in Hair Fashion and Design in 2008. It was tough at first — cutting hair is not as easy as it seems! My lecturers kept lessons enjoyable though. The facilities at ITE — including a fully-equipped salon where we could learn everything from hair styling to colouring — also helped keep me motivated, as did the support I got. Back then, I practised on my family and friends — cutting their hair along a HDB corridor, with perspiration and hair all over my face. I supposed they liked it since they came back for more. That gave me more confidence to pursue my “art”. In 2010, I was selected to be part of Team Singapore at the 8th WorldSkills Asean in Bangkok and pit my hairdressing skills against other youths in the region. I had to train intensively before that, and I’m proud that it paid off — I earned a Gold medal. In 2011, I travelled to London for the WorldSkills’ international leg. This meant competing with the top-performing youths of each participating country. It was an eye-opening experience being able to represent Singapore on the global stage. I was glad to bring home a Medallion for Excellence. I completed my first Nitec in 2010, and graduated with my second in hair and scalp therapy in 2012. My first job was a hair assistant. I was later promoted to stylist and moved around a few salons over the next few years. However, it was always my dream to open my own salon. In 2016, that dream finally came true. With some savings, and plenty of support from my family, I opened Harts Salon in Bugis. As a salon owner, I have a lot more responsibilities. I have to provide for my team, get customers in, manage people, and generally make sure things run smoothly. To attract customers, I turned to social media marketing, showcasing our services and whatever was trending in the industry. The effort paid off and soon, I was getting back-to-back appointments. Before I expanded, I was attending to three to seven customers a day. It was a challenge to meet their expectations and I did worry at times that they would not like what I have done for them. These days, my challenge lies more with managing and training my team of stylists. I started out with a team of four and I’ve steadily expanded it to 24 across three salons. With a large team like this, it’s not easy paying attention to the individual stylist’s performance, but I try my best. I’m still growing and seeking out new ideas so I can stay ahead in the industry, for example by keeping in touch with the latest hairstyle trends. Operations-wise, I make sure there is transparency, and emphasise the need for good customer service among my team. As an ITE graduate, I’m committed to nurturing talent and providing opportunities for fellow alumni in the industry. For example, before Covid-19 hit I was going back to ITE on an ad-hoc basis to share my experience with students. I have also hired some ITE grads at my salon, and I'm proud that a few of them have advanced to higher positions elsewhere! For those looking to join the industry, you must enjoy hairdressing. When you start out, you are at the bottom rung but with perseverance and determination, you can be successful. ABOUT THE WRITER: Noel Ng, 31, is the owner of Harts Salon located in Bugis. He also co-owns Hint Salon at Tanjong Pagar and Hei Ardour at Orchard Road. He believes that a good hairstylist is like a surgeon operating on hair — and can earn just as much as one. Outside of work, his favourite pastime is searching for good food.

Mohamad Rezza Abdul Malek Published February 4, 2024 Updated February 4, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I have worked as a police officer and flight attendant, but have always been drawn to trains. I am intrigued by how they move and operate. In 2014, I turned that fascination into a career when I joined SMRT as a train captain. It was a position I stayed in for eight years. As an operator on the North-South Line, my job was to drive trains and rectify any faults that occurred. A shift could start as early as 4.30am. I would usually begin by retrieving equipment such as the train keys, handheld radio, and iPad. I would then proceed to my assigned train and prepare it for service by doing onboard checks, before driving it from the depot to the main line. We began transitioning towards automated trains in 2018. It was a period of adaptation for me as I had to learn how to operate and attend to faults on automated trains. It was also challenging when we upgraded to a new signalling system on the North-South Line that same year. There were a few teething issues which caused delays. This made commuters anxious and frustrated, and I had to remain calm and collected when they approached me. Despite this, I enjoyed my time as a train captain, especially looking out for great views during the golden hours after sunrise and before sunset. Since then, I have had the chance to upgrade my skills and progress in my career at SMRT. Back then, my highest qualification was a Nitec in Precision Engineering (Aerospace), which I received from the Institute of Technical Education Balestier in 2007. Thanks to a work-study programme fully sponsored by SMRT, I was able to complete a diploma in Engineering (Rapid Transit Technology) at Singapore Polytechnic in 2023. It was tough balancing part-time studies for 2.5 years, while doing my job and taking care of my family. Nonetheless, I enjoyed gaining relevant knowledge which helped me in my daily work. I was also fortunate to be sent to Mauritius on a six-month assignment in 2020, where I was part of a team that helped share our knowledge of driving and handling trains with our counterparts there. There, I learnt to adapt fast to a different culture. Being away from my family also taught me to be resilient. The experience also made me feel fortunate to realise that Singaporeans enjoy one of the best public transport systems in the world. In February 2023, I was promoted to crew manager and depot controller at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. I now oversee the train captains’ reporting schedules and control the movement of trains in the depot. This includes ensuring that trains enter service on time and smoothly via a train control system which allows me to set routes within the depot. My new role allows me to manage daily operations, as well as share my knowledge and experience with the junior train captains. At times, I do miss being in the front seat of a train and making announcements to communicate with commuters. It’s fulfilling to see commuters enjoying a safe and smooth ride. My work is mostly deskbound now, but I must constantly be alert and attentive while on duty. A few seconds’ delay in my response to any issue could impact our operations. And although my job requires me to work on the weekends sometimes, I have learnt how to manage my time with my family. They have fully supported every decision I have made, and this has made me strive to be the best at what I do. Working in public transport is rewarding as many people depend on the MRT system to get around. To those who are thinking about joining the transport industry, I would say believe in yourself and give it a try. The work can be tough but satisfying if you always give it your best and keep improving your skills and knowledge. ABOUT THE WRITER: Mohamad Rezza Abdul Malek, 36, is a crew manager and depot controller at SMRT’s Ulu Pandan Depot. He was previously a police officer from 2007 to 2012, and a flight attendant from 2012 to 2014. He is married with three daughters aged six, 13 and 14. He loves to travel and go on long drives.

Koh Han Jie Published February 11, 2024 Updated February 11, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Being a chef was never on my radar until I entered the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). I wanted to work after my N-Levels, but my mother insisted that I continue with my studies. She encouraged me to pick up a skill. So, I enrolled at ITE at 17 and got into a National ITE Course (Nitec) in Western Culinary Arts at ITE Clementi in 2011. Even then, I wasn’t interested at all. I went to school and just hoped to pass. It was in my second year that everything changed. I was serving my culinary internship at a European restaurant in Raffles Place when I discovered that I actually liked cooking. During the six months there, I spent long hours with the chef and realised that this, and the fast-paced environment, created a special bond among the kitchen crew. It sparked my love for cooking and motivated me to do better. After completing my Nitec in 2012, I trained for the 2013 WorldSkills Competition in Leipzig, Germany, where I achieved a Medallion for Excellence. I went on to do my Technical Diploma in Culinary Arts at ITE College West the following year and had the chance to take part in a culinary cook-off organised by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay in 2014. Mak Jia Kee/TODAY Mr Koh Han Jie, 30, poses for a photo in Amber West Restaurant at ITE College West on Jan 26, 2024. The challenge was only revealed on the day itself — we had to cook eggs in three different ways in 10 minutes. I had then only just learnt the different techniques and even encountered some technical difficulties during the competition. But I won the cook-off and got an internship at Ramsay’s Bread Street Kitchen at Marina Bay Sands for a month. I was very happy and excited. I certainly didn’t expect this win would lead me to more opportunities. I obtained my diploma in 2015 and did a four-month internship at a three-star Michelin restaurant in Valence, France under renowned chef Anne Sophie Pic. It was a good learning experience, but certainly very challenging. I struggled with the French language. I understand basic kitchen terms but to receive instructions in French while keeping up with the fast pace in the kitchen was not easy. However, I did learn a lot about French culture and cuisine, station placing, and new cooking techniques, which helped me during my career. After returning to Singapore, I worked at fine dining restaurant Les Amis for two years before heading Elfuego by Collin’s for three years. My last stint was at French restaurant Ce Soir — I was there for two years and left last November as I plan to set up my own restaurant. This has been a dream of mine since I entered the industry. There are definitely huge risks and challenges that I will face, but setting up a restaurant provides a platform for me to put what I’ve learnt into good use. I also hope that doing so will inspire others to pursue their dreams. I looked at over 50 places before finally finding a suitable one in terms of location and price. If things go smoothly, I look forward to opening in May or June this year. What I enjoy most about cooking is coming up with new dishes and the different ways of executing them. The whole process excites me. I also find that taking part in competitions forces me to think out of the box to create top-level dishes. In the eight years since I entered the industry, I’ve taken part in several competitions: I was the first Singaporean to win the Young Talents Escoffier Asian trophy in 2017 in Hong Kong and the international leg in Zurich, Switzerland the year after. That is probably my proudest moment. As a chef, I normally spend more than 12 hours at work. Often, we sacrifice our personal time, especially during festive periods. Despite this, my love for food and commitment towards my guests are what keep me moving forward. My family are very happy with how far I’ve come, though they do wish they could spend more time with me. Cooking is an art form. It requires a lot of passion. If you intend to enter the industry, you really must love it. My advice — enjoy the process and manage your mental and personal health.

By Alexis Heng Boon Chin By Alexis Heng Boon Chin Published February 15, 2024 Updated February 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I refer to the article \" Baby Steps: 'Toughest period of my life', say women who underwent costly, emotional IVF process. Can more be done to support them? \" (Feb 13). It stated that some Singaporean couples travel overseas to do pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) of their in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) embryos, due to restrictive regulations at home. Currently, PGS is only open to women who are 35 and above, or those regardless of age who have two or more failed IVF procedures or two or more recurrent pregnancy losses. In 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said only 104 patients had undergone PGS thus far. It is necessary to understand the various drawbacks of PGS and why it is so strictly regulated by MOH. First, patients must be aware that genetic screening can potentially damage their embryo. The technique is highly invasive, involving drilling a hole through the embryo shell and extracting cells for biopsy. This is potentially harmful and can impair its development. Experts have pointed out that studies claiming no ill effects of PGS on embryos are often based on testing of excellent high-quality embryos rather than more \"delicate\" lower-quality embryos that might suffer more. Because older women tend to have weaker lower-quality embryos, these may be more prone to damage upon testing. Second, genetic testing is prone to misdiagnosis, which could result in patients discarding viable embryos that can give rise to a healthy baby. This is because the testing involves extracting cells only from the outer embryo layer that produces the placenta and umbilical cord, which is not representative of the inner embryo layer that gives rise to the baby itself. \"Mosaic embryos\" containing a mixture of genetically normal and abnormal cells have demonstrated the ability to self-correct and produce a healthy birth. This \"self-correction\" mechanism involves pushing out the genetically abnormal cells into the outer embryo layer, which gives rise to the placenta and umbilical cord. Older women have a limited number of embryos during IVF. Therefore, excluding or discarding mosaic embryos that can potentially give rise to a normal baby, would substantially reduce their chances of IVF success. Some older IVF patients may have no embryos left to transfer after genetic testing. Third, several large-scale clinical studies have shown that PGS does not improve IVF success rates. In 2019, a large multi-centre randomised clinical trial involving 34 IVF clinics in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia and including 661 patients aged between 24 and 40 years, found no significant overall improvement in IVF success rates with PGS. In 2021, another large clinical trial in China, involving 14 IVF clinics and a total of 1,212 patients aged between 20 and 37 years, reported similar unfavourable results that were published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. Hence, based on the latest scientific and clinical data, serious doubts about the medical benefits of PGS have emerged, and current stringent regulation by MOH is thus justified.

Vigneshwaran Gunasegaran Published March 17, 2024 Updated March 17, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Singaporeans are increasingly seeking out meaningful, skilled labour, amid a growing push for better recognition and pay for such professions. TODAY’s Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young Singapore residents who have chosen careers in manual trades and are thriving. Here, Mr Vigneshwaran Gunasegaran, 39, talks about his transition from an army regular to a career in the rail industry. The Institute of Technical Education graduate, who has spent 10 years with train operator SMRT, works the graveyard shift and oversees track access for engineers and technicians. I started my career as an army regular, serving as an infantry leader and then a trainer at the Specialist Cadet School. After a decade of service, I embarked on a transformative career shift from carrying rifles to holding a portable radio to manage MRT track access with train operator SMRT. During my army days, I had fond memories of the years when I took the first train in the morning from Paya Lebar to Joo Koon station to report for duty at Pasir Laba Camp. I have always been amazed by the punctuality of our trains and the smoothness of the rides captivated me, instilling a deep appreciation for the efficiency of the rail services. It was this admiration that spurred my decision to join the rail industry and contribute to its excellence. March 10, 2024 marked a significant milestone as I celebrated my 10th anniversary at SMRT Trains. I started out as a technical officer in a team overseeing re-signalling work and my duties included testing communications-based train control. In 2018, I switched to a new role to become a ground controller. This involved coordinating track access at a specific interchange station along the North-South East-West Line. Continuing my journey of professional growth, I moved the following year to work in the Operation Control Centre, where I currently serve as a track access controller. In this role, I am tasked with controlling and authorising track access of all stations on the North-South East-West Line and ensuring adherence to safety protocols when SMRT engineers and technicians carry out their daily maintenance on the tracks, which is in the middle of the night when the trains are not running. I monitor track access by using the company’s Track Access Management System which gives me a clear overview of my colleagues on the tracks as well as their movements, so that I can ensure that these abide by safety protocols. Before track access is given at any point, I have to go through various levels of checks with my colleagues in the Operations Control Centre to ensure that traction power is off, safety protection arrangements are in place and engineering trains stabled at worksite. Otherwise, this would mean that my colleagues could be exposed to a risk of electrocution at the trackside and be seriously injured. My highest education qualification is a National ITE Certification in Electronics Engineering (Computer Technology) from the Institute of Technical Education but I hope to be able to pursue a diploma related to rail engineering through a SMRT’s educational advancement programme in the near future. Balancing the demands of night shifts with familial responsibilities has been challenging but fulfilling. Since my job requires me to work from about 9pm to 6am in the morning, I plan my schedule well in order to manage my work and spend time with family and friends. It was initially not easy as my children were young when I first joined SMRT, but with proper time management, I was able to juggle both my work and family responsibilities. I’m lucky that my family and friends see my passion and commitment towards work and support me wholeheartedly. As I work at night, I must constantly be alert and attentive on duty as any delay in my response to any track-related issue could impact the safety and timeliness of our operations. Although my job may be considered a blue-collared one, I find it rewarding because I can see tangible results from my efforts. From safeguarding colleagues on the tracks to ensuring seamless journeys for commuters, each day presents an opportunity to make a meaningful difference. Looking back at my journey in SMRT, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact our work has on the community.

Chen Junyi Published April 10, 2024 Updated April 10, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I refer to TODAY’s report on why the 2026 Commonwealth Games is struggling to find a host. With the 2026 games seemingly doomed to be cancelled due to lack of a host, the Commonwealth of Nations may want to consider decentralising future events to several host cities instead. This can significantly reduce the costs of hosting the games, particularly the need to build new facilities which risks being underutilised after the event. Several different cities, or even small nations, can bid for hosting of one or more sports which they have more confidence in managing. It could be a discipline popular in their own country or region, or a case of them having existing infrastructure that are well placed to host the events. Given the global spread of Commonwealth countries, it should not be too difficult to find various hosts that can accommodate a schedule where the weather is conducive for competing. While the economic benefits are less for the individual hosts, so are the costs and risks. With different events conducted simultaneously in different cities, the Games can be completed in a shorter period too than the typical 10 days or more presently. While it means sportsmen and sportswomen from different disciplines may be in separate parts of the world, it may allow greater interaction among the fewer numbers onsite at each host city. Ultimately, this approach provides opportunities for more cities and countries to host events of the Commonwealth Games and encourage participation from those which have never done so. Some dilution of commercial sponsorship can be expected, but this may spur more attention on the sports themselves and enjoyment of simpler but more personal experiences of bringing people together. There is no way for the Commonwealth Games to compete with the Olympics, or specialised sporting events like World Aquatics or the World Cup for football. Perhaps a paradigm shift to focus more on member participation and meaningful camaraderie will help it establish its own niche to remain relevant.

TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Mr Elijah Chao, 20, describes how he co-founded The Resonance Project at 16 to teach music to underserved children. What began as a musical endeavour evolved into a movement of youths passionate about making a difference. Elijah Chao Published May 5, 2024 Updated May 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I spent my late teens building a community and leading others to serve. And I wouldn’t trade the experience for any other. My former classmate Ivan Chiew — a guitarist and pianist — and I — a drummer, were just 16 when we started The Resonance Project (Reso), which has brought music to communities across Singapore since January 2021. We hoped to teach music to children who may not have had the same access to music lessons as we did. To my surprise, we weren't alone. Youths around Singapore resonated with our mission and within six weeks, we already had close to 100 student volunteers signed up with us. Working with a team this large was completely new to us. In the following weeks, I began to realise that what we were creating was not just about music. Rather, it represented a wider movement of students who wanted to make a real difference with their time. Scaling up quickly meant that Reso now had to support three weekly music programmes for our beneficiaries. We had to move fast to build some semblance of a curriculum and develop our first team structure. We designed a curriculum in four areas: Keyboard, ukulele, guitar and vocals. Providing free instruments was important to us, so we had to quickly raise funds through T-shirt sales to recoup the hundreds of dollars we had already spent on the first tranche of ukuleles. Uniquely, our programmes did not have an end date. This meant that the kids we served wouldn’t have to worry about us leaving in a few months. Each week, our volunteers would run a 90-minute to 120-minute session, inclusive of a practical lesson, games and time for catching up, on one of the four instrument curriculums we taught. Our pedagogy was simple, less music theory, more enjoying music as an expression, and most importantly, building strong friendships. Elijah Chao At one of the first hybrid sessions after the partial lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Elijah taught chord changes on the ukulele. Despite the hustle, the next few months were largely smooth sailing. I got to know the kids that I was working with much better, and started to realise the true impact we could bring about with our project. Many of the children came from less-than-ideal family situations and it was a privilege to be a “ kor kor ” (older brother) of sorts. Music might have been our medium, but it was my friendship and presence that really made the difference and brightened up their day. To my kids, I became affectionately known as “bird's nest hair”. It was always a joy to be greeted by the stampede of primary schoolers excited to see us. However, growing quickly came with downsides. The level of work and commitment required during the initial setup phase caused several volunteers to leave. We needed to do things differently to keep the team intact. That meant creating a culture of giving that our volunteers believed in, rather than just a “project” that might be phased out anytime. Covid-19 restrictions during the pandemic further accelerated this need. Our programmes had barely begun when we had to cancel sessions. Despite not being able to serve physically, we pivoted towards improving our systems, teams and curriculum instead. A committed group of about 70 — half our members at the time — poured hundreds of hours working online in task forces. They planned out over a year of curriculum, prepared for hybrid sessions and worked on our administrative systems. We also launched “Reso Recharge” sessions — weekly online meetups where team members could study, watch movies or have deep conversations. These sessions provided emotional support to our volunteers during some of the lonelier periods of the semi-lockdown period of the pandemic in 2020. Over time, our volunteers began to see Reso as a circle of trusted friends and something we found worth investing. We resumed sessions in late-2021 and welcomed 127 new members that November. Our team identity also began to form — along with many friendships. Our previous investment into programme planning also paid dividends. Being better equipped, we could focus more on building relationships with our beneficiaries. In 2022, our community grew to more than 300 members. We then had our first opportunity to meet in-person after a year of Zoom meetings. By 2023, many started to describe Reso as a home, a community that they really loved. We also began to reach thousands more across new communities through our events and community concerts. Now, in 2024, Reso’s weekly sessions serve more than 200 children and seniors at more than 18 locations, including social service agencies and senior activity centres. To me, these are not merely numbers — they represent real people and relationships. Three years in, our kids have grown to see us as their kor kors and jie jies (older sisters), while we are like “grandchildren” to our seniors. In short, we get to be like family; ready to listen, support them or even cry with them. Now, at 20, I’m grateful for the trust of my team, and for all the people from whom I've learned. I am grateful that we built a community, knowing that even after I step down, the work, the culture and the spirit of giving will continue. As for me, it will soon be time to explore new ways to bring people together. Through this journey, I’ve learnt that there is value in coming together, investing deeply in people and serving actively. We need many more communities that unite students from different schools in the service of others. ABOUT THE WRITER: Elijah Chao, 20, is the co-founder of The Resonance Project .

L Priyeswari Devi Published May 12, 2024 Updated May 15, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I'm a mum to an adorable one-year-old girl, an educator specialising in community engagement skills, and the founder of a ground-up initiative dedicated to South Asian women in Singapore. My journey with Don't Say OK, Kanmani is deeply influenced by my late mother. She passed down not only knowledge and wisdom, but also cultural norms and rules set aside for South Asian women. For instance, “no entering a temple when you’re menstruating”. These were passed down by her mother, and her mother before that, and they were taught not to question these rules. Inspired by my mother’s struggles, I was determined to shatter this silence. Don't Say OK, Kanmani began in 2020 as a platform for South Asian women to share stories, seek support, and collectively challenge societal norms. The name Don’t Say OK, Kanmani (defined as precious one in Tamil) is a gentle nudge to many women, especially from minority communities, who perhaps tend to say “OK” too easily, accepting whatever is given without asserting themselves. For the past four years, we have highlighted the stories of countless women, each sharing her unique lived experiences. We do this by hosting fireside chats and panel discussions on a range of topics affecting women. These include menstrual health, cultural taboos, and female leadership. We delve into these subjects to understand their profound impact on our daily lives. Being a South Asian woman myself, I recognise that we have internalised certain societal expectations. Dismantling them remains a gradual process, with women and girls encountering unique obstacles, especially in patriarchal societies. Ili Nadhirah Mansor/TODAY The writer with her daughter, Sarah Aaliyah, at their home on April 30, 2024. For instance, it is challenging to address sensitive topics such as marital expectations, which can often evoke resistance or discomfort due to entrenched cultural norms. I empathised deeply with the barriers these women faced. They were not completely unfamiliar to me, as growing up, I too witnessed this in my own home. I've noticed that although girls and women eagerly sign up with us, they frequently hesitate to voice their opinions. Overcoming these barriers required not only sensitivity, patience, and a commitment to creating a non-judgmental space, but also a profound understanding of the emotional weight these topics carry. One approach we employ involves sharing our own stories and experiences — the emotions and struggles we've endured. By being vulnerable and transparent about our own journeys, we aim to create a sense of understanding within the community and harness the powerful tool of storytelling. I also recognise that participants prefer online sessions when it comes to some topics, giving the option to remain anonymous. We usually hold monthly small-scale sessions of up to 60 participants as these are more manageable for our team to handle. Each month has a different theme. For instance, in February we met with younger girls to talk about the importance of female friendships and finding support. In March, we hosted female business owners to discuss how we could further support one another. The success of Don’t Say OK, Kanmani isn't measured solely by participant numbers or events we’ve had. Rather, it lies in the resonance it generates within the community. For instance, my core team, including Asha Suresh and Nandhini Balakrishnan, whom I had never met before the initiative, joined after discovering our Instagram page, which currently has about 1,900 followers. Many other women have similarly connected with our work and collaborated with us on various projects. Now, the thought of navigating this journey alone feels unimaginable. Another source of joy was our fireside chat last December on female leadership and its societal role. Women expressed a longing for spaces like ours, fostering meaningful dialogue and community engagement. Their positive response affirmed the importance of valuing these leadership approaches and facilitating such crucial conversations. My mother died in 2022, but her response to Don't Say OK, Kanmani remains a profound source of inspiration for me. Before her passing, she conveyed immense pride in the initiative and its influence on the community. On numerous occasions, she expressed her desire to contribute in any way possible, even wanting to involve her friends. In fact, our recent initiative called Tech Mama, aimed at bridging the digital gap between different generations, is a tribute to her — inspired by her willingness to learn new things — and included some of her acquaintances. My tip to anyone wanting to start a ground-up community is to always keep the community at the centre of everything you do and bring them along on the journey! In the words of an African proverb, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” ABOUT THE WRITER: L Priyeswari Devi, 33, is a lecturer teaching Creative Community Engagement with Psychology at Singapore Polytechnic, and the founder of Don’t Say OK, Kanmani, a ground-up initiative dedicated to South Asian women.

TODAY's Voices section is publishing first-hand accounts of young changemakers and the stories behind their initiatives. Here, Miss Cassandra Yip-Lee, 24, recounts the inspiration behind her initiative, Earth School, the challenges faced in championing environmental education in Singapore and her plans for the future. Cassandra Yip-Lee Published May 20, 2024 Updated May 20, 2024 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn I’m a passionate environmentalist who runs Earth School — a non-profit organisation that aims to increase environmental literacy among children and youth in Singapore. I started Earth School as a ground-up initiative about three years ago at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic with some of my classmates. We were then all second-year students in the National University of Singapore’s Bachelor of Environmental Studies programme, and we have been sharing our love and knowledge about nature and the environment ever since! I had previously worked at Young Sustainable Impact Southeast Asia, an incubator and accelerator for youth sustainability start-ups. I was inspired by the community there to one day also start something impactful. This opportunity came in 2021, during the Covid lockdowns, when everyone was picking up new hobbies. It made me think about my passions — nature and the environment — and what is missing in the current ecosystem: Education. Hence, Earth School came about. A consensus among my classmates and I is that, growing up in Singapore, we had very limited to no exposure to nature-based or environmental studies. I remember very clearly that my answer to questions such as “what do you want to be when you grow up?” was “marine biologist”, but that never seemed to be a career option. We believe in giving young Singaporeans hope (and proof) that being an environmentalist is indeed a dream that can be realised in our country. Over the past few years, we have worked directly with public schools, charities and grassroots communities to develop environmental education curriculums and pioneer sustainability initiatives. More than 50 students from five primary schools took part in our first programme, Student Heroes in Environmental Leadership Development (Shield), in 2022. Covid-19 regulations were still in place then, so we ran lessons online over Zoom. The 10-week programme covered a different topic each week, such as clean and affordable energy, and sustainable cities and communities. These are based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in 2015 as a roadmap to creating a sustainable, equitable and prosperous world. We aimed to introduce environmental sustainability topics to young students in the context of Singapore and help them understand the challenges that we face and what is being done to mitigate them. A typical lesson would start off with an introduction to the topic, for example: “What is climate change? What is the science behind it? What are its impacts?” This would include diagrams and videos. We even built an online simulation of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and Central Catchment Nature Reserve ourselves. We would also present big issues to our students, such as rising sea levels and deforestation. One of the more memorable moments was when an 11-year old asked us: “What happens after the Semakau Landfill becomes full ?” We then realised that young Singaporeans had the intellectual and emotional capacity to think about their future here. However, we no longer run the entire 10-week programme now due to the substantial resources required. Instead, we have taken individual lessons from it and continue to run them with various partners. One of the biggest challenges we face is convincing mainstream schools and educators of the importance of climate science and environmental education, especially for students under the age of 12. A common experience is when a profit-making educator or school approaches us to run a programme for them, and we get very excited about the opportunity to redesign a school wall to show parts of a terrestrial ecosystem, or build solar-powered cars with little girls. However, when we ask what their budget is, it turns out that they were expecting us to run it for free, including covering the expenses for materials. Unfortunately, there is a common misconception that non-profit organisations have zero costs. We learned from these experiences and have now prioritised working with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and charities such as Glyph, Budding Minds and HCSA Dayspring to run free or heavily subsidised programmes for them. These include outdoor in-nature lessons and some indoor activities such as microgreen growing. We also have about 10 volunteers who help with nature walks, curriculum development and publicity. We believe that exposure to the natural world can inspire creativity and innovation, as well as instil a sense of belonging and responsibility to care for our country’s green places and wildlife. The best part about the work we do is when we see children get really excited — be it about spotting wildlife in their natural habitat or getting their hands dirty to grow their own microgreens. In 2023, we decided to register Earth School as Earth Academy Limited, a company limited by guarantee . Being a non-profit organisation allows us to make environmental education affordable and accessible to all. We are now working on building Singapore’s first nature classroom, which will be open to the community. My advice to those interested in starting an environmental NGO is to not underestimate how far perseverance will take you. Starting your own thing is incredibly challenging, but it’s a learning process where opportunities can present themselves when you least expect them.

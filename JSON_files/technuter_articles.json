    "article_content": "LAN parties are a fantastic way to get together with friends for a good spot of gaming. However, there’s such a saturated game market out there that it can be difficult for everyone to get on the same page about which games to play. Luckily, we’ve got you covered with this list of five best games for LAN parties. LAN parties are opportunities for gamers, typically using computers, to come together and play their favorite multiplayer games using a local area network (LAN) connection. LAN parties have been around since the early days of computer gaming, where they were often held at universities and other venues. However, thanks to innovations in fiber optic internet , there’s nothing to stop you from hosting a LAN party at home. Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is a free-to-play first-person shooter (FPS) game developed by Valve, which is the company behind the gaming platform Steam . Since its release in 2007, the game has had a series of updates including features, new maps, items, and classes. The premise is simple: two teams compete against each other to complete objectives. Each of the nine player classes has a different ability ranging from fast-moving to stealth. TF2 is a popular option for LAN parties because it’s free, challenging, fun, and it’s very easy to learn. Among Us was released in 2018 for mobile and in 2020 for Nintendo Switch and PC, and it’s a game all about social deduction. Inside a spaceship, players are divided into Imposters and Crewmates . The Crewmates complete simple tasks while the Imposters sabotage the ship and attempt to kill the Crewmates. The mission is clear: either kill the Crewmates or identify the Imposters. This game is brilliant for LAN parties because it can be accessed on almost any device, it’s easy to use, and it’s a great way to laugh with friends. An FPS game developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) pitches a team of terrorists against a team of counter-terrorists. One team has to plant a bomb and the other team has to prevent the bomb threat. While it’s often played on PC, it can be accessed on PS3 and Xbox 360. CS:GO is a great addition to any LAN party because it has a simple goal but there’s a steep learning curve, meaning it’s got an appropriate level of challenge. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the latest release in the popular Nintendo game series. Featuring characters from the Mario universe, players race against each other in a whacky event full of explosions and deception. There are around 42 characters to choose from, 48 tracks, and several different modes including couch/online multiplayer, which is why it’s a popular choice for LAN parties. Choosing games for a LAN party can be challenging, so we hope this list at least points you in the right direction. However, you should note that it’s by no means extensive, so head out and do your own research. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Source: Pixabay Digitization has immensely impacted the worldwide economy since its onset in the 1950s. In 2021, mobile technologies alone generated $4.5 trillion of economic value; this figure is expected to grow by $480 billion over the next two years. Over the years, some industries have adapted better than others to the digital revolution, and this article will explore a few of these sectors by looking at specific companies in detail. Many companies that dominated the traditional gambling landscape have transformed into online powerhouses. For example, Paddy Power is a gambling company that began by merging in-person gambling shops in the 1980s. Today, gamblers can play bingo at Paddy Power from their homes, gaining access to live bingo games and jackpot bingo games, all while taking advantage of welcome offers and bonuses that aren’t typically available at land-based gambling shops. Other online gaming options are available such as poker and blackjack. In particular, online casinos have benefited from the change in consumer behavior that digitization has created, such as the desire for consumers to have more convenience and flexibility in how they choose to entertain themselves. Audi is a German automotive manufacturer that specializes in luxury vehicles. For years, Audi showrooms were full of some of the company’s most expensive and luxurious cars for consumers to see and touch in hopes of persuading them to buy one. Audi began incorporating digitization into its business model in 2012 when it introduced Audi City. Audi City is a cyberstore experience in different city centers that lets shoppers browse car models digitally. Not only does this make Audi a more digital-friendly brand, but it also means the company is using tactics from experiential marketing. MailChimp states experiential marketing is a fun way to engage consumers. Source: Pixabay ITV is one of the biggest media companies in the United Kingdom. However, the established success of ITV hasn’t stopped the company from paying attention to market trends and seeing where it can use the popularity of emerging digitization patterns to its advantage. For instance, one way ITV has done this is by launching its online video-on-demand streaming service, ITVX. The service, previously known as ITV Player, was established in 2008 before getting a revamp in 2015 and launching the ITVX that’s around today in December 2022. The service directly competes with the digital offerings of networks like the BBC. In 2021, roughly 16 million households in the UK had at least one subscription service. While Amazon Prime takes the crown for the most subscribed service in the UK, ITVX is rising in popularity. As of December 2022, ITVX had around 37 million users. Some of the most popular TV shows on ITVX include One Tree Hill, Without Sin, A Spy Among Friends, and The Vampire Diaries. Adapting to the digital world hasn’t been easy for every industry and company. However, some have taken the transition well and had additional success because of it, and this is particularly true for industries like online gambling and entertainment.

    "article_content": "In today’s fast-paced and undoubtedly ever-changing business environment, agility is a valuable trait that can give your company a competitive edge. An agile business can quickly adapt to market shifts, respond to customer needs, and innovate in a way that traditional organizations often struggle to achieve. If you’re looking to make your business more agile, here are some key strategies to consider. Before you can make your business more agile, you must understand and adopt agile principles. Agile is not just a set of methodologies; it’s a mindset that values customer collaboration, responding to change, and delivering working solutions. Embrace values like customer satisfaction, continuous improvement, and flexibility. In an agile organization, work is done by cross-functional teams that bring together members with diverse skills. These teams have the autonomy and responsibility to complete projects from start to finish. By breaking down silos and promoting collaboration among team members, you can speed up decision-making and problem-solving. Choose an agile methodology that suits your business needs. Scrum, Kanban, and Lean are popular frameworks that help organizations structure their work, manage tasks, and continuously improve processes. Implementing agile methodologies can streamline your project management and make your business more responsive to changes. You could take an Agile Coaching course to teach your employees the methodologies you want to implement. Agile organizations empower their employees to make decisions and take ownership of their work. Trust your teams to find innovative solutions and adapt to challenges. Encourage them to take the initiative and provide them with the resources and support needed for success. Place your customers at the center of your business strategy. Regularly gather feedback from customers and adapt your products or services accordingly. This customer-centric approach ensures that you’re meeting their needs and preferences. Break down projects into smaller, manageable pieces and develop them iteratively. This allows you to release products or features more quickly and make improvements based on real-world feedback. Iterative development reduces the risk of lengthy, costly projects that might miss the mark. Foster a culture of continuous improvement. Encourage employees to identify areas for enhancement and implement changes. Regularly review and adapt your processes and practices to stay responsive and efficient. Lean thinking involves minimizing waste and maximizing value. Identify and eliminate activities that don’t add value to your products or services. This approach can streamline processes and enhance efficiency. Consider restructuring your organization to be more flexible and adaptable. Flatten hierarchies, reduce bureaucracy, and create an environment that promotes open communication and quick decision-making. Leverage technology to support agility. Tools like project management software, collaboration platforms, and data analytics can enhance your ability to respond to market changes and customer preferences. Use key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of your agile initiatives. Regularly assess your progress and make data-driven decisions to refine your strategies and practices. Invest in training and education for your employees to ensure they understand and can apply agile principles and methodologies. The more your teams know about agile, the better they can embrace and implement it effectively. Conclusion Becoming more agile as a business is a journey that requires commitment, effort, and a cultural shift. Embracing agile principles, fostering collaboration, and continuously adapting to change can make your organization more responsive, innovative, and competitive. Start small, experiment with agile methodologies, and gradually expand these practices throughout your company. The benefits of increased agility are well worth the effort and will position your business for success in an ever-evolving marketplace. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "In today’s fast-paced world, data has become a valuable asset for businesses and organizations across various industries. One technology that has revolutionized the way we collect, analyze, and visualize data is a Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS services play a crucial role in driving innovation and decision-making by providing valuable insights through spatial analysis. In this article, we will explore the importance of GIS services and how they are shaping the future. GIS is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and present spatial or geographic data. It combines multiple layers of information, such as maps, satellite imagery, and demographic data, to create a comprehensive view of a specific area or location. GIS services encompass a range of applications and tools that enable users to leverage spatial data effectively. These services include data collection, mapping, analysis, visualization, and decision support. By utilizing GIS services, organizations can make informed decisions, identify patterns, and gain a deeper understanding of their operations and the world around them. Improving Infrastructure Planning GIS services are instrumental in infrastructure planning and development. By integrating spatial data related to transportation networks, population density, and environmental factors , a transportation engineering firm and urban planners can make informed decisions regarding road and public transit systems, land use, and zoning. Managing Natural Resources GIS services play a vital role in managing natural resources effectively. By mapping and analyzing factors such as soil quality, water availability, and vegetation cover, environmental agencies can make informed decisions on land use, conservation efforts, and disaster management. For instance, GIS services can help identify areas prone to wildfires and enable proactive measures to mitigate risks. Effective Data Visualization One of the key strengths of GIS services is their ability to visualize complex spatial data in a user-friendly manner. By creating interactive maps , charts, and dashboards, decision-makers can understand and communicate information effectively. This visual representation enhances decision-making by enabling stakeholders to see patterns, outliers, and trends at a glance. Collaboration and Integration GIS services facilitate collaboration and integration across departments and organizations. By providing a centralized platform for sharing and accessing spatial data, different teams can work together seamlessly. For example, emergency response teams can use GIS services to coordinate disaster response efforts by sharing real-time information on affected areas, evacuation routes, and available resources. Scenario Modeling and Predictive Analysis GIS services enable users to create scenario models and conduct predictive analysis based on spatial data. City planners can simulate different growth scenarios and analyze their impact on traffic congestion, housing demand, and environmental sustainability. This helps decision-makers anticipate and plan for future challenges. GIS services have become indispensable tools for driving innovation and decision-making across various industries. By harnessing the power of spatial data, organizations can gain valuable insights, optimize operations, and make informed decisions. As we continue to embrace digital transformation, GIS services will play an increasingly critical role in shaping the future of businesses and societies alike. Whether it’s optimizing store locations, planning sustainable cities, or managing natural resources, GIS services are paving the way for a smarter and more connected world.

    "article_content": "Our mobiles have become an extension of our bodies. We cannot go without them, as they have become a vital aspect of our lives. They are our personal organizers, a way to communicate with others, and even offer ways to be entertained, whether playing games like those available online or streaming our favorite tunes, TV shows, movies, or audiobooks. Additionally, they have become a popular method for making financial transactions . We can use our smartphones to access our bank accounts and make financial transactions. They are convenient and offer a rate of speed that other methods simply cannot match. However, with the advancements in technology having been beneficial for the most part, security concerns have arisen. Cybersecurity has become a focal point nowadays, as hackers have also been able to benefit from the developments that technology has been able to experience. Users need to recognize and understand the vulnerabilities that may exist and do their best to ensure they are best protected if they decide to use their mobiles when making payments and transactions. While often overlooked, it is important to continue to update your phone’s software and any apps that are used. These updates will usually address security features and provide the latest tech to combat any potential vulnerabilities that may have been identified. Passwords have always been a first line of defense in terms of security, but they may not always be enough, especially if they are easy to guess. It is important to try to think of something unique or complex while also remaining easy to remember. Failing that, it can be a good idea to use two-factor authentication or biometric software to prevent unauthorized access. When making a payment, it is important to ensure a reputable provider is offered and used at all times. There are many globally recognized mobile payment providers around nowadays that offer safety with each transaction that is made through the use of PCI DSS compliance. Those who like to use their mobile to play casino games and need to make a deposit may want to read the YYYcasino online review by Arabic experts , as this can help identify which methods may be the best to use when making a financial transaction on the web. While the availability of free Wi-Fi can be great, it can also be dangerous when not used correctly. As anyone can often use it, hackers can often look to intercept the data that is being used. This can leave your details vulnerable and open to attack. A VPN can be a great way to continue using public Wi-Fi (or even add security to private networks), as it can hide the user’s location and keep their identity anonymous. Staying safe when making a mobile payment or transaction is vital in this day and age. There are numerous simple steps that can be taken in order to limit any potential threats that may occur, and by following these, individuals will be able to conveniently make the transactions that they want to make in the securest way possible.

    "article_content": "Source: Pexels 5G has emerged as a revolutionary force, and industries like mobile gaming stand to benefit. Due to its ultra-low latency and near-instantaneous responsiveness, 5G opens mobile gaming to real-time interactive features like augmented reality. The network facilitates a more consistent user experience and high multi-Gbps peak data speeds. As on-the-go gaming may involve large amounts of data transfers between servers and users, reliable networks like 5G offer the needed convenience for such transfers. The widespread adoption of mobile phones and apps has brought tremendous possibilities for online businesses and consumers. For instance, customers no longer need to queue in long lines to receive banking services in the banking sector. They can do multiple transactions like paying bills while on the go, saving time for other things. It has not been different in other industries, including iGaming. In the casino industry, for instance, developers have enabled players to access different casino products, such as best book slots , without staying in a fixed location. Whether they are Android or iOS users, they can access ancient themes like the Book of Dead, Rise of Merlin, Book of Kings, etc. This way, casino enthusiasts can immerse themselves in their favorite games even on the go. Advancements in mobile hardware have played a crucial role in elevating on-the-go gaming. Powerful processors, high-refresh-rate displays, and sophisticated graphics capabilities in modern smartphones contribute to delivering quality gaming experiences. Enhanced smartphone hardware capabilities ensure that users can have seamless experiences. As chip manufacturers continue to advance their offerings, we can expect systems that power higher resolutions while using less battery power. Source: Pexels With average speeds of 100+ Mbps that peak at 20 Gigabits per second and a maximum bandwidth of 100 MHz, this technology works wonders on mobile gaming. The enhanced speed enables faster downloads and updates, allowing gamers to access their favorite titles quickly. This means reduced waiting times and more time spent playing the games, contributing to a more immersive gaming experience . 5G’s increased bandwidth supports more immersive multiplayer experiences, including features like faster real-time audio conversation.

    "article_content": "Starting your very own business, no matter which industry it’s in, can be one of the biggest challenges you ever take on. It requires a lot of dedication, skill, and good fortune to successfully launch a new business, especially when it comes to the construction industry. This is because there are already so many construction businesses out there that competition is aggressively fierce. However, don’t let this put you off. Here’s what you need to know to get your construction business noticed. Who Will Your Target Market Be? You need to know who you intend to cater for as a construction business. If you aren’t clear about who your target market is , you won’t be able to successfully brand yourself and make your business known to the right people. Think about which demographics your business would serve the best. Are you hoping to attract business from private homeowners? Other businesses? On what scale? Make sure you have all this figured out from the beginning. What Will Make Your Business Stand Out? Once you know who you want to attract to your business, you will need to find a way to stand out from the competition. It can be particularly difficult to do this in the construction industry since there are so many options for customers. Do you want to focus on high-end customer service or perhaps highlight a quality standard above your competitors? Draw attention to what makes your business more trustworthy and better value for money than the others. What Equipment Do You Need? There is so much specifically designed equipment that construction companies need in order to function. The exact types of machinery and equipment will vary depending on the kind of construction your business focuses on, but it’s still necessary to consider where you will source it from. Although you may have grand ambitions to eventually own your own warehouse and every piece of equipment possible, at the beginning you will most likely need to settle for the more affordable option of renting. This will help you to establish yourself within the industry without overspending on expensive equipment upfront. For example, you can find lift truck rentals for your requirements that reduce the costs for new business owners. Even experienced and successful construction companies often prefer to rent their equipment when it makes better financial sense. When considering whether or not to buy something, decide what your budget should be for the equipment and project how often it will be useful within your business operations. Which Locations Will You Work Within? Some construction companies bid on jobs that take their teams worldwide, whereas others prefer to concentrate on a few smaller areas to make their mark. The scale of your business doesn’t need to be limited to your early decisions, but if you plan to grow into a national or international business , factor this into your plans. Strike the balance between aiming too high and not aiming high enough. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Source: Pexels The fusion of technology and healthcare is revolutionizing how we approach wellness. In our previous article, we discussed the introduction of new health features in iOS 17 , as well as iPadOS 17 and watchOS 10. These updates allow users to track and manage their medications, view their available health records from multiple institutions, and even share stored data with caregivers using Health Sharing. These advancements signal a paradigm shift in how individuals engage with their health. With this new mobile landscape, there are now new avenues for addressing several pressing health concerns — including smoking cessation. As we delve into the intersection of technology and smoking cessation, we take a look at how digital innovations are reshaping the landscape of quit support services, offering unprecedented opportunities for individuals to embark on their journey towards a smoke-free lifestyle. In recent years, the smoking cessation market has witnessed a notable shift towards quitting smoking aids. In particular, smokeless products have emerged as a popular choice among consumers, as they offer a discreet and convenient way to satisfy nicotine cravings without the side effects of traditional products. This trend has garnered momentum thanks in part to the convenience of online platforms. Online platform Prilla capitalized on this by making a variety of nicotine pouch brands readily available to consumers, whether it’s the best-selling ZYN, known for its distinct nicotine distillation procedure, or the popular On!, which stands out for its variety of delicious flavors. Purchasing online allows consumers to access smokeless products that are stored under optimal conditions. This is especially key for users of On! pouches who can enjoy the crisp flavors of its Citrus, Cinnamon, or Wintergreen products without compromising on freshness or quality. All consumers have to do is browse Prilla’s user-friendly website and add their desired products to their cart before choosing among the different shipping options to deliver directly to their doorsteps. The rise of e-commerce has significantly contributed to the accessibility of smokeless products, making it easier for individuals to find and purchase these alternatives to traditional tobacco products. This is why even established pioneers like Nicorette and NicoDerm have embraced the digital transformation, with the former launching a new website in 2022 to sell its original Nicorette gum and lozenges online. The site is equipped with tools and resources to support individuals throughout different stages of their quit journey, especially as research proves that integrating alternatives into quit support programs can increase quit smoking success by up to 70%. Unsurprisingly, quit support programs have also transitioned online, offering individuals convenient access to smoking cessation resources and support. A 2021 study published in JMIR demonstrated the effectiveness of combining the iQuit Mindfully app with nicotine patches in achieving strong cessation retention rates of 22% by the end of the program. This combined self-help material, a text messaging program, and 21-mg patches for participants who smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily — highlighting the potential of online platforms to enhance the effectiveness of quit support programs. As the popularity and success of online quit support programs continue to grow, they have evolved to incorporate various digital services. Telehealth has emerged as a valuable tool for expanding access to smoking cessation services. In telehealth consultations, pharmacists can engage with patients through live video conferencing sessions. A 2022 study showcased the effectiveness of a community pharmacist-led smoking cessation intervention using the PharmQuit smartphone app . By integrating digital tools into traditional pharmacy services, such as counseling and medication management, PharmQuit offers a comprehensive solution for smoking cessation support. Looking ahead, the smoking cessation market is poised for further transformation as more stakeholders recognize the potential of digital solutions. With increasing demand for accessible and personalized support, we can expect to see continued innovation in e-commerce platforms, quit apps, and telehealth services. By harnessing the power of technology, the smoking cessation industry has the opportunity to make significant strides to meet the changing needs of consumers in their journey towards tobacco-free living.

    "article_content": "In a world where the cost-of-living soars and unexpected expenses are a part of daily life, personal loans have emerged as a vital lifeline for many. Thanks to digitalization, obtaining these loans has become easier than ever. As of February 2023, outstanding personal loans have surged to over ₹40 lakh crore, marking 20.4% y-o-y, from the previous year’s ₹33 lakh crore, as per RBI data. Keeping this in mind, timely repayments will not only help in maintaining financial stability but also boost creditworthiness. The key to mastering personal loans lies in responsible usage and a misstep, like defaulting on EMIs, can swiftly plunge you into a debt trap. Therefore, mastering personal loans involves not just obtaining funds but strategically managing and repaying them, creating a path towards financial resilience and stability in an unpredictable world. Consider these five effective ways to repay your loan with ease. Taking charge of your finances starts with crafting a budget. Use it to analyze your monthly income and expenses by tracking your expenses. Commit to a monthly budget that covers all your needs and cut back on unnecessary spending. Before you jump into the personal loan world, make repayment your top priority. Sync your EMI payment date with your salary date, putting it at the forefront of your monthly financial commitments. Alternatively, create a dedicated fund solely for covering your EMIs, ensuring consistent and timely repayments without financial bumps. Tired of juggling multiple loans and timely payments? Combine all your debts into one personal loan for a simpler repayment process and maybe even a lower interest rate with debt consolidation. It’s a cost-effective solution, especially. When you have various obligations, like personal loans, keeping up with monthly payments can be tough. Get a debt consolidation loan to merge all your bills, including credit card debt, into one. Enjoy the ease of a single monthly payment at a fixed interest rate, potentially lowering your overall interest costs. To boost your income and tackle personal loan repayments, explore side businesses or monetize your interests. Renting out a property or discussing potential income sources can help you create additional funds for loan repayment, thus reducing your debt-to-income ratio. Another way is to sell the idle assets by liquidating investments like real estate, gold, or mutual funds can provide the necessary funds to pay off your loan and effectively manage your finances. Accelerate your journey to debt freedom by making part-prepayments when possible. Beyond regular EMIs, channel extra funds toward the principal amount. This not only chips away at the principal but also reduces the accruing interest. If circumstances allow, consider foreclosing the personal loan entirely, albeit with potential foreclosure charges. While this approach demands financial discipline, the reward is a quicker and more affordable resolution. Above all, approach personal loans with a sense of responsibility. View them as tools to navigate temporary financial challenges, and only take them when armed with a clear repayment plan. Understanding the commitment involved and making informed decisions can transform personal loans from potential pitfalls into stepping stones toward financial stability. While managing personal loans need not be a daunting task but one needs to be careful in planning, making strategic choices, and being responsible to navigate the repayment journey smoothly. Remember, financial freedom is achievable with the right mindset and a well-thought-out repayment strategy.

    "article_content": "Razorpay launched Instant Refunds on UPI transactions by Razorpay POS. This solution will allow merchants to provide a more seamless in-store payment experience to their customers by providing instant refunds for failed UPI transactions within 2 minutes, resulting in faster checkouts. Commenting on the industry-first solution, Byas Nambisan, CEO, Razorpay POS, said, “With the increasing preference towards providing omnichannel payment experiences, businesses must have access to the right solution that can make this happen, end-to-end. According to our data, 5-15% of UPI transactions see friction due to pending status and our merchants lose their business in 30-40% of the cases wherein the customer is not comfortable making a double payment via UPI or paying through any other method. It was therefore critical for us to nip this in the bud by empowering our merchants to make these instant refunds happen, enhancing customer satisfaction, trust, and faster checkouts. This new offering reiterates our goal of simplifying money movement and demonstrates our innovation-first mindset as we continue to work towards shaping the future of payments.” Using Razorpay POS device’s fully automated system, the refund process now takes a maximum of 2 minutes compared to the industry standard of 5 to 6 business days. The process involves a swift attempt within 3 seconds, concluding if successful. In case of failure, the system persistently attempts thrice, each attempt spaced 5 seconds apart, sparing a merchant’s manual efforts altogether. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Remote has selected Nium, the global leader in real-time cross-border payments, to enhance its international payroll capabilities. The partnership will be launched on a global scale, enabling businesses to instantly send employee payroll and contractor payments worldwide. The global multicounty payroll solutions market is expected to approach $10.5 billion USD by 2030. Much of this growth is concentrated in emerging markets, with the Philippines, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia among the top 10 destinations for payroll payments facilitated by Nium in 2023. Today, the fintech company has sent $2 billion USD in payroll payments to 134 countries around the world. As more businesses look at new markets to power growth, the ability to hire and scale across borders is rapidly becoming a key differentiator. But for global companies, managing multi-country payroll can be complex, with local compliance, technology, and cultural norms to navigate. As workforces expand internationally, even more difficult challenges arise creating a scalable, secure, and reliable international payroll model – without incurring excessive foreign exchange (FX) or transaction costs, significant risk, and back-office inefficiencies. Today, tens of thousands of companies use Remote to find, hire, manage, and pay talent all over the world. Now, the global HR platform has partnered with Nium to expand its real-time cross-border payments capabilities and geographic coverage, so it can continue to deliver best-in-class payroll solutions for its new and existing corporate customers. As India emerges as a key destination for global business expansion, managing multi-country payroll complexities becomes pivotal. Remote and Nium’s collaboration is tailored to address the unique needs of Indian businesses, providing them with scalable, secure, and compliant international payroll solutions while mitigating excessive foreign exchange costs and back-office inefficiencies. The partnership will initially launch in 20+ markets across Europe, the United Kingdom, and Asia, supporting disbursement models including corporate payroll and contractor payments. This is the start of an exciting roadmap for the fintech duo, with plans to add more payment corridors, markets, and methods to the combined offering in future. Job van der Voort, CEO and Co-Founder at Remote, said, “As companies become increasingly global, the complexities of expanding compliantly across international borders also grow. Our partnership with Nium is designed to address these complexities head-on. Payroll is at the heart of any business and our partnership provides customers even greater confidence in their abilities to grow teams that stretch globally and still get paid on time, every time, in their local currency – no matter where they are in the world.” With access to Nium’s global real-time payments infrastructure, Remote can provide its clients with multi-currency wallets, allowing funding in over 20+ local currencies and avoiding the hassle of setting up and managing local bank accounts. Live interbank exchange rates can be locked in for up to 24 hours and converted to make cross-border payroll in bulk. Employee and contractor payouts can be sent via flexible payment options to bank accounts, cards, and e-wallets in over 220+ markets and 100+ real-time corridors around the world. Prajit Nanu, CEO and Founder at Nium, said, “If businesses want to stay competitive, it’s crucial that mission-critical payments like payroll don’t just work, but work well. And yet, companies continue to rely on legacy infrastructure or limited cross-border payment solutions to pay their employees and contractors worldwide. After all, payroll isn’t just about money. It’s about employers finding new ways to deepen connections, improve retention, and say thank you to their increasingly diverse and globally dispersed employees. We’re helping Remote deliver this differentiation to its customers and look forward to enabling people and businesses all over the world to realise the full potential of real-time cross-border payments together.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "EY India’s latest report titled ‘Realising AI for All in India’ underscores the necessity for sustained policies and emphasises the pivotal role that government intervention can play in fostering the beneficial utilisation of AI technology. The report outlines key policy considerations aimed at expediting AI development and ensuring its democratisation. These include revitalising telecom investments, catalysing an open data ecosystem, fostering research initiatives, implementing ethical AI practices, and reforming education to meet the demands of the AI era. Prashant Singhal, Telecom Leader, Indian Member Firm of EY Global said, “India has made significant strides in positioning AI as a leading development tool. To leverage the full potential of AI, the government is also creating an ecosystem through strategic policy interventions. However, to access India’s readiness to drive widespread social impact, the government must address key areas including technology infrastructure, research capabilities, skills development, regulatory environment, and the establishment of ethical AI guidelines.” Emphasising the government’s crucial role in steering extensive AI implementation, the report outlines six key considerations to position India as a hub for AI. Open data ecosystems: Promote sector-based data trusts and platforms for collecting and sharing data: Data and AI hold the potential to address dual goals of economic and social value creation and recovery. Open data ecosystems are crucial for advancing AI development, emphasising the need for a robust data infrastructure in priority sectors such as agriculture, healthcare, and mobility. The quality of data determines the effectiveness of an AI model. As part of the IndiaAI Mission, the government will develop a non-personal data collection platform accessible to Indian startups and companies. Revive investments in telecoms infrastructure: Reviving telecom infrastructure to support AI applications, steps include reducing telecom levies, minimizing Right of Way charges, and subsidising fiber deployment costs. Collaborating with operators for rural connectivity and implementing TRAI’s recommendations can expedite deployment. Additional initiatives involve de-risking handset financing, reducing taxes on entry-level smartphones, and encouraging private players to establish ecosystems for refurbished handsets in rural areas, creating a supportive telecom environment for AI growth. Promote AI research and AI CoE: To advance AI in India, it’s vital to focus on regional language research, establish AI Centers of Excellence CoEs, and create tailored datasets for major Indian languages. Invest in research and development of algorithms and models specific to Indian languages. Promote collaboration between industry regulators, private players, academia, investors, and venture capital firms to expand the regional-language applications and content. Establish more state-level CoE hubs for AI, with focus areas such as Generative AI and computer vision, or even create sector-driven CoE such as those focused on agriculture, education, public services, etc. Establish AI clusters for rural innovation: To nurture a self-reliant AI ecosystem, vital initiative includes aligning AI clusters with government bio-incubators under Startup India. India needs to step up AI funding and provide targeted incentives to promote the commercialisation of AI applications. Encourage rural innovation through dedicated funds for AI startups in rural areas. Incentivising AI-allied industries in hi-tech manufacturing, particularly essential components like chips and networking equipment, is crucial. Implement ethical AI frameworks: Concerted efforts are needed to address issues of algorithmic bias and other ethical considerations. Ethical AI implementation demands focused efforts to tackle algorithmic bias and ethical concerns. Leading the establishment of comprehensive AI ethics guidelines is crucial. Promoting bias prevention, detection, and mitigation in AI systems is vital. Recommending the development of open-source AI testing frameworks and toolkits supports startups, researchers, and public/private entities. Promote public awareness of AI and reform education: India needs to incorporate fundamental aspects of AI systems starting from the secondary school level. Create mandatory training around automated decision systems’ societal, legal, ethical, and political impacts. Impart working knowledge for non-professional users of AI and build teaching capacity and accelerate digital delivery of education. Your email address will not be published.

The platform supports BT Group to re-skill and up-skill colleagues by offering them personalised learning as the Group works to boost productivity and transform the skills base in its business. BT Group has been rolling out My Campus as its new learning platform for its colleagues over the past 12 months. My Campus draws its content from industry-leading digital skills platforms such as Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning, as well as proprietary BT Group learning content, including videos, courses, articles and podcasts, to ensure its people have access to cutting edge professional learning. Supported by Degreed’s technology, My Campus delivers personalised learning content to BT Group colleagues based on their role, interests and preferences enabling them to learn anywhere and at any time. A soft launch phase has seen My Campus made available to over 46,000 colleagues across BT Group’s Business, Digital, Networks and Corporate units – with 42% of them actively engaging with the platform. The partnership with Degreed makes learning through the course of the working day more intuitive and seamless for BT Group colleagues. The learning platform is integrated with the Group’s consolidated human resources platform, MyHR, powered by SAP’s SuccessFactors. This provides a single system of record for colleagues, including tracking mandatory training and personal development plans. Sharing skills data between SuccessFactors and Degreed also enables BT Group to drive greater talent mobility, to improve workforce planning and to surface relevant learning for colleagues based on the skills they identify. In addition, BT Group’s My Campus is now integrated with Microsoft Teams, saving colleagues time and effort in accessing their learning without having to switch between different screens and platforms. Nick Hawkes, HR Technology Director, BT Group’s Digital Unit said: “We needed to build a platform that people loved to use, to overcome the friction that is in place for so many around learning at work. Delivering a modern, learning experience, which surfaces deeply personalised experience through engaging learning content and pathways, has been key to our early success with My Campus, and we’re excited to build from here. More broadly, this is a great example of BT Group’s ambition to use the power of AI in a safe and ethical manner to unlock immense value for our customers and colleagues, in line with our purpose to ‘connect for good’.” David Blake, CEO of Degreed said, “BT Group had tremendous vision here – deploying personalised, user-friendly learning at scale, drawing on a wider bank of content, tightly integrated into MyHR – it’s a world class implementation we’re all very proud of.

    "article_content": "Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has introduced a new numbering series, 160xxxxxxx for making service/transactional calls. This initiative is a step towards providing citizens with a way to easily identify such legitimate calls. Currently 140xxxxxxx series has been allocated to telemarketers for making promotional/service/transactional voice calls. As 140xx series is being used extensively for promotional calls, consumers normally do not respond to such calls and many important service/transactional calls are missed. This has resulted in wide use of regular 10-digit numbers by genuine entities for making service/transactional calls. This also gave opportunity to fraudsters to deceive consumers using 10-digit numbers. Hence, in order to create confidence among the consumers and to enable them to distinguish between the spam calls originating from 10-digit unknown numbers and the genuine service/transactional calls from genuine Principle Entities, there was a need of separate number series to cater service/transactional voice calls. To fulfil this need, the DoT has allocated a new numbering series, i.e., 160xxxxxxx which will exclusively be used for service/transactional voice calls by the Principle Entities. This clear differentiation between service/transactional calls versus other types of calls will make it easier for citizens to manage their communication. Now, for example, the service/transactional calls originating from Financial Entities like by RBI, SEBI, PFRDA, IRDA, etc shall start from 1601. Telecom Service Providers (TSP) shall be ensuring adequate verification of every entity before assigning a number from 160 series and the entity shall undertake to use it only for service/transactional calls as per Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR), 2018. Consumers can have more confidence in the legitimacy of calls from the 160xxxxxxx series, reducing the risk of falling victim to scams. For any suspected fraud communications, Citizen are advised to report it on Chakshu facility at Sanchar Saathi ( www.sancharsaathi.gov.in ). The DoT encourages consumers to activate the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) Do Not Disturb (DND) feature to block unwanted promotional calls, further enhancing their protection against spam. Details on New Number Scheme Service Call means a voice call made to recipient either with his consent or using a template registered for the purpose, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously consented to enter into with the sender; or to provide warranty information, product recall information, safety or security information with respect to a commercial product or service used or purchased by the recipient; Transactional Call means a voice call which is not promotional in nature and is for the purpose of alerts to its own customers or account holders and information to be communicated by the voice call is time critical in the nature; Promotional Call means commercial communication voice call for which the Sender has not taken any explicit consent from the Recipient to make such voice calls to him.

    "article_content": "Nokia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya (GSV) to pursue research and development opportunities in the areas of transportation and logistics in India. The research collaboration agreement will bring together Nokia’s telecommunication and research expertise with GSV’s expertise in transportation and logistics. The MoU was signed at Rail Bhawan, New Delhi, in the presence of Sh. Ashwini Vaishnaw (Minister for Railways, Communications, Electronics & Information Technology) and senior officials. On this occasion, Sh. Ashwini Vaishnaw, who is also the Chancellor of Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya, said, “This important collaboration has very significant potential to leverage advances in the telecommunications sector for the entire transportation and logistics sectors. This MOU further reinforces Industry-driven approach of the university to proactively co-work with the industry stakeholders for a Viksit Bharat.” Nokia and Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya will collaborate on research opportunities in 5G/6G communications targeting air, land and sea transportation use cases, as well as standards development, smart factory/automation, and AI/GenAI labs. The collaboration has a research focus specifically on leveraging Nokia’s Network as Code platform with developer portal and digital twins for transportation and logistics sectors, fiber sensing and AI, and optical network planning. The Network as Code platform with developer portal reflects Nokia’s strategic focus to drive new business models and unlock the potential that networks can deliver in terms of innovation, sustainability, and productivity. It enables developers and operators to accelerate the work of producing software applications for enterprises, industrial entities, and consumers, and monetizing 5G and 4G network assets beyond basic connectivity. GSV, a Central University created by the Act of Parliament, operates under the Ministry of Railways with a mandate to cover the entire transportation and logistics sectors in India for multidisciplinary education, research, skilling and executive education. Raghav Sahgal, President of Cloud and Network Services at Nokia said, “We are extremely pleased to collaborate with Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya University to create efficiencies in the logistics and transportation sectors. This agreement reflects how Nokia is driving its strategic focus of leveraging the broader B2B digital ecosystem. With its reputation for stellar research and innovation, GSV will be an excellent partner in pursuing these opportunities while supporting our mutual interests and stakeholders.” Nishant Batra, Chief Strategy and Technology Officer at Nokia said, “Sharing a common desire to foster growth and advancement in industry in India, Nokia is honored to collaborate with Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya University to research and jointly develop use cases to solve India’s unique logistic and transportation challenges. The network will be at the heart of India’s transportation ecosystem, and Nokia is committed to supporting India’s ambitions as a global powerhouse for transportation innovation.” Prof. Manoj Choudhary, Vice chancellor, Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya said, “Being the only university in India to focus on the transportation and logistics sector, GSV has set its vision to be Industry-driven and Innovation-led. The collaboration with Nokia will further accelerate the technology-enabled progress in the transportation and logistics sector as well as advance the telecommunications sector.” The collaboration with GSV is the latest in a series of recent collaborations between Nokia and the Indian research community. In October 2023, Nokia opened a 6G Lab at its Global R&D center in Bengaluru. The first-of-its-kind research facility aims to accelerate the development of fundamental technologies and innovative use cases underpinned by 6G as well as foster collaboration between Nokia and India’s academic community.

    "article_content": "Dell Technologies and Ericsson announce a strategic partnership to combine their deep industry expertise with telecom software, solutions and support, to guide communications service providers (CSPs) through their radio access network (RAN) cloud transformation journeys. CSPs are looking to network cloud and operations transformation to achieve improved economics and agility, while maintaining network reliability. According to a new MeriTalk study released, sponsored by Dell Technologies, nine in 10 CSPs say network transformation is critical to their organization’s survival. However, 96 percent of CSPs surveyed say their network transformation vision is lagging due to a variety of factors including limited time and budget, as well as reliability and security concerns, ultimately holding them back from giving their customers a modern network. Dell and Ericsson’s partnership aims to address these concerns by working alongside CSPs to develop simple and reliable Open RAN-based network cloud transformation strategies, using Dell and Ericsson integrated solutions and support. “Communications service providers have a crucial window of opportunity to lay the foundation for network cloud transformation and drive business growth,” says Dennis Hoffman, senior vice president and general manager, Telecom Systems Business, Dell Technologies. “Our collaboration with Ericsson, combined with our decades of digital transformation expertise, will provide network operators the full plan and technologies they need to accelerate their network and operation transformations to positively impact the trajectory of their businesses.” “Working closer with Dell Technologies will help further develop cloud-native programmable networks that bring new ideas and practices to the telecom market,” says Fredrik Jejdling, Executive Vice President and Head of Business Area Networks, Ericsson. “Building upon years of collaboration, this strategic partnership will strengthen our cloudification efforts as we gear up to launch Open RAN-based commercial solutions. The cloud-native network will enable frequent updates and the rollout of new features using continuous deployment. It will ease the adoption of Cloud RAN technologies and prepare both companies’ portfolios for new markets.” Through the new agreement, Dell and Ericsson will: “To accelerate cloud-based open networks, the telecom industry needs vendors to come together to develop solutions that deliver more growth opportunities with minimal risk,” says Chris Sambar, Head of Network, AT&T. “We look forward to the continued innovation and collaboration as we continue our Open RAN journey.” In 2023, Ericsson and Dell Technologies began a collaboration to develop Cloud RAN solutions, leveraging Ericsson Cloud RAN software and RAN equipment paired with Dell Technologies infrastructure, with the common goal of broadening the ecosystem and bringing more flexibility to customers.

    "article_content": "Kia India unveiled K-Charge — an innovative initiative in the ‘MyKia’ app that allows users to discover over 1000 EV charging stations nationwide. In one of the industry-first moves, Kia is extending access to this charging network to non-Kia customers, providing valuable assistance to Indian EV users in overcoming Range Anxiety. This strategic move reflects Kia’s commitment to enhance customer services by consolidating various functions into one user-friendly smartphone app. Kia has collaborated with 5 charging point operators (CPOs): Statiq, ChargeZone, Relux Electric, Lion Charge, and E-Fill charging operators to enable this initiative. Kia India has also done a special tie-up with Relux Electric to offer its customers 3 months of free charging through their charging stations. The onboarded CPOs are the pioneers in the EV charging industry, providing adequate networks, global best practices, and safety protocols. Integrating these CPOs on the ‘MyKia’ app is done by NumoCity Technologies – one of the leaders in CMS services. The new features offer additional convenience to EV users through deeper technology integration, empowering them to seamlessly access a wide range of EV services right at their fingertips. The users can view and locate the charging station through an interactive map of the Made-in India map service provider – Map My India. Through K-Charge, customers can check the availability of charging slots, locate one based on their preferences and even pay through the same platform using the wallet service within the app. The array of user-friendly functionalities not only simplifies EV charging but also removes the need to rely on multiple external applications, demonstrating Kia’s vision of embracing technology to improve the vehicle ownership experience. Mr. Hardeep Singh Brar, National Head of Sales and Marketing – Kia India, said, “K-Charge is not just a convenience initiative for our customers but a step towards making sustainable mobility convenient and accessible for everyone. We strongly believe that the technology transition towards a complete EV future ought to be smooth, and the K-Charge, integrated into the ‘MyKia’ app, is a well-thought-out step in that direction. With this aim, we will continue our efforts towards expanding the charging network through the onboarding of new CPOs in the future. We are confident that seamless, user-friendly solutions like these will play a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in India.” Through its newly introduced vision – ‘EV for All’, which encompasses the K-Charge initiative, Kia aims to achieve an annual sales target of one million EVs by 2026 and expand that to 1.6 million units annually by 2030 aided by the launch of various long-range BEVs. In India, Kia has already shared its EV strategy, which lays out the launch of global EV models in India along with a locally manufactured EV in the RV body style by 2030.

The MoU has three key objectives. First, it seeks to broaden the use of UPI payments for travelers outside of India, enabling them to conveniently make transactions abroad. Second, the MoU intends to assist in establishing UPI-like digital payment systems in other countries, providing a model for seamless financial transactions. Lastly, it focuses on easing the process of remittances between countries by utilizing the UPI infrastructure, thereby simplifying cross-border financial exchanges. The outlined objectives will help accelerate UPI’s global acceptance, providing foreign merchants access to Indian customers who will no longer have to rely only on foreign currency and/or, credit or forex cards for making digital payments and will have the option using UPI powered Apps from India including Google Pay. This is in alignment with NPCI’s endeavor of bolstering India’s position in the global digital payment landscape. Moreover, the MoU will also significantly contribute to simplifying remittances by reducing dependence on conventional money transfer channels. Deeksha Kaushal, Director, Partnerships, Google Pay India said, “We are delighted to support NIPL towards expanding the reach of UPI to international markets. Google Pay has been a proud and willing collaborator to NPCI and the financial ecosystem, under the regulator’s guidance, and this collaboration is another step towards our commitment to making payments simple, safe and convenient. UPI has demonstrated to the world the step change that happens in economies with the introduction of interoperable, population scale digital infrastructure and each economy that joins such networks will create impact beyond the sum of parts. We are very excited about the scope of this collaboration.” Ritesh Shukla, CEO – NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL), said, “We are pleased to team up with Google Pay to propel UPI onto the global stage. This strategic partnership will not only simplify foreign transactions for Indian travelers but will also allow us to extend our knowledge and expertise of operating a successful digital payments ecosystem to other countries.

This new product category is a powerful move by the recently NASDAQ listed company, Zoomcar, offering up to 50% lower pricing for same day bookings and up to 30-45% off for next day bookings paving the path to new found affordability and accessibility for guests. Zoomcar is available across 45+ cities in India including delivery to guests at transit points like airports and railway stations with a comprehensive portfolio of cars across categories – Hatchbacks, Sedans, MUVs, SUVs, EVs, and Luxury cars. Compared to cab rentals who typically have surge pricing for immediate demand, this innovative pricing offering is set to transform the landscape of self drive car sharing with a customer first approach making it more affordable and enjoyable. Local hosts on the Zoomcar platform have the ability to opt into this feature to increase the usage of their vehicles during the weekdays with an expectation of increasing their overall earnings. Designed to reinforce the relative value and competitive pricing of self-drive, Thrift Store’s transparent and predictable new affordable pricing structure, aims to build trust and foster long-term relationships with its valued customers. Greg Moran, CEO and Co-Founder Zoomcar said “We want to put the pedal to the metal with Thrift Store where guests can experience the freedom of spontaneous self drive travel. It is a game changer for our local hosts too, making their cars instantly available for bookings while maximizing their earnings and contributing to a more sustainable and efficient car-sharing ecosystem. This is not a one time marketing campaign but an always on product offering as Zoomcar remains fully committed to making the self-drive experience not just convenient but also fully affordable to the everyday consumer.” Adarsh Menon, President at Zoomcar, added, “Zoomcar’s Thrift Store is our solution to offering one of the most convenient & cost effective travel options especially given the freedom and privacy of self drive. We want our customers to feel confident while driving a car worry free without the fear of unexpected costs, breaking the bank or even owning it. For the hosts, it is our endeavor and promise to provide them an increase in bookings and sustained income.” A recent report from Zoomcar also shared an industry leading NPS with an average trip rating of nearly 4.7. The Thrift Store product launch is a testament to Zoomcar’s commitment to customer-centric innovation and its broader focus toward building a stronger self-drive car sharing ecosystem.

    "article_content": "Swiggy and the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) have signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) to deliver pre-ordered food on trains. The MoU was exchanged between Mr Sanjay Kumar Jain, Chairman and Managing Director, IRCTC and Mr Rohit Kapoor, CEO, Swiggy Food Marketplace, in the presence of senior officials from both organizations. As part of the MoU, Swiggy will deliver food from its extensive restaurant network to passengers on the Indian railways starting with Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada. The service is likely to expand to 59 additional city stations in the coming weeks. Speaking about partnership , Mr Sanjay Kumar Jain, Chairman and Managing Director, IRCTC, said, “At IRCTC our focus has always been to explore new ways to make train journeys comfortable and convenient for the billions of passengers aboard the Indian railways every year. This partnership with Swiggy will bring more convenience and food options to our passengers, making their journeys more memorable.” “Swiggy’s mission is to bring convenience to the lives of consumers. The Indian Railways are the lifeline of our nation, transporting more than 8 billion passengers annually. If during these rail journeys, which traverse across states and districts, one has the option to order meals to explore the culinary diversity of India, it would make the experience more convenient and enjoyable, and add to the overall vividness of the train travel,” said Mr Rohit Kapoor, CEO, Food Marketplace, Swiggy . One of the challenges encountered by travelers during extended journeys is the paucity of diverse culinary options. Through this integration, passengers aboard designated trains now have the option to savour good-quality, warm meals delivered right to their seats, thereby transforming their travel into a convenient and delightful culinary experience. “IRCTC and Swiggy collaboration is natural in several ways. Both the organisations have built a reputation of leveraging technology to improve consumer experience. Both have a pan-India presence. In the first phase, we are starting with deliveries on stations of Bengaluru, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar. We are hopeful of a buoyant response from passengers and restaurant operators on this route, which will hopefully lead to us providing services on more stations and on newer routes,” added Kapoor. Passengers can avail pre-ordered food services via Swiggy by following the below steps: The food delivered to passengers will be packed in insulated Swiggy bags to keep the meal warm and fresh. Swiggy’s delivery partner would reach the selected platform X mins before delivery, hand over the food to the customer and mark the food delivered. To ensure smooth operations, effective issue resolution and maximum comfort for the passengers, Swiggy’s support agents will be trained in resolution process, gratification & cancellation policies. The support agents will also be equipped to connect with restaurants and delivery partners based on the order status and the nature of the customer issue. Your email address will not be published.

Phani Kishan, Head of Swiggy Instamart said, “FASTag stands for seamless payment and convenience, and access to it should be the same.

With FASTag now available on Swiggy Instamart, users can procure it anytime, anywhere, slashing delivery wait time from days to under 10 minutes.” Commenting on the partnership, Amit Lakhotia, Founder & CEO, Park+ , said, “At Park+ our main objective is to bring delight back to car ownership.

    "article_content": "For every festive shopping season, solutions that enhance the customer experience and help speed their decisions are increasingly critical. To optimize retail operations and efficiency, Honeywell announced the latest release of its powerful SwiftDecoder barcode-decoding software, designed to make shopping easier and help ensure a seamless retail experience. Used by companies worldwide to scan millions of barcodes each day, SwiftDecoder transforms camera-enabled devices into efficient barcode scanners, offering fast and accurate data capture. For retailers, it seamlessly integrates the software’s augmented reality plug-ins into both store associate- and customer-facing applications. This integration boosts productivity by enabling the scanning of shelf tags and visually overlaying graphics and information on the screen. This is beneficial for store associates managing inventory and ensuring price label accuracy, as well as for customers seeking promotional and nutritional details, helping to provide a frictionless checkout experience. David Barker, president of Honeywell Productivity Solutions and Services, said, “SwiftDecoder is enabling retailers to create innovative applications that revolutionize the customer journey. Fast and frictionless checkouts not only boost customer satisfaction but also improve operational efficiency, allowing businesses to embrace a forward-thinking shopping experience. With Honeywell technology, accurate and real-time product information is delivered to both associates and customers, leading to higher-quality customer interactions. This convergence of technology and consumer empowerment is helping to reshape the retail landscape, promising a future where frictionless, efficient, and convenient shopping is the new norm.” Ashish Modi, president, Honeywell India, said, “The Indian digital economy is growing exponentially, and the Indian retail industry is embracing digital transformation for better outcomes that include improving customer experience and enhancing process efficiency. As a global leader in mobility solutions, Honeywell Technologies are enabling productivity and efficiency for retailers. The new SwiftDecoder barcode-decoding software leverages augmented reality, has high reliability in handling intricate workflows, swift data capture, enhances the shopping experience, and will be a game-changer in shaping the future of retail.” As we gear up for the next festive season and the shopping season continues, solutions enhancing the customer experience and bringing speed to shoppers’ decisions will be critical. With purchasing options like click and collect and innovative options like “Shop and Go” – where consumers can complete purchases in-store without interacting with an associate – the adoption of SwiftDecoder presents an opportunity to create unique shopping experiences that will keep consumers coming back for more. Research firm Gartner reported that customer experience influences 66% of loyalty, surpassing price and brand combined, and 94% of consumers are more likely to make future purchases with a positive experience. Reduced wait times at checkout mean that more customers can be served in a shorter period which, in turn, can increase the store’s overall sales potential. This technology can also facilitate better inventory management by providing real-time data on product popularity and availability, helping businesses make more informed stocking decisions. SwiftDecoder’s advanced image-processing algorithms can be used in many different devices, including mobile phones, tablets, computers, wearable scanners, drones, and kiosks for a variety of retail and logistics applications.

This collaboration will leverage WinZO’s extensive user base of over 175 million users, primarily accessing the internet in vernacular languages. WinZO is India’s first skill gaming company to collaborate with ONDC. WinZO is the largest interactive entertainment platform in India. The company partners with third-party developers to host games on their app, providing users with personalized multiplayer gameplay experiences in 12 languages. The WinZO platform facilitates over 4 billion micro-transactions per month across a portfolio of 100+ games and accounts for at least one out of every 300 UPI transactions in India, representing one of the highest volumes of UPI transactions driven by digital content players in India. WinZO is renowned for its unique user demographic, primarily hailing from Tier II-V cities of Bharat, characterized by high-frequency, low-value transactions or microtransactions.

    "article_content": "What role has IoT played in enhancing school bus tracking system in India? As per National Crime Records Bureau, 22,442 persons, including school children lost their lives in bus accidents in India from 2018-2021. As the number of accidents and incidents of crime has risen, parents have become increasingly concerned about the safety of their children while they are being transported to and from school. This heightened level of anxiety is due to the potential dangers and security threats that their children may encounter during their commute. Concerning the school students’ safety, the Transport Department of the Government of India has made installation of bus trackers mandatory for newly registered vehicles. The Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI) has mandated that all public and private school buses have an AIS 140 authorized GPS gadget with panic buttons. Due to these safety concerns, schools are increasingly adopting transportation system technologies to enhance their capabilities. This led to emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) that ensures complete visibility of school buses. While traditional GPS-based data confirms the location and movement of the bus, IoT empowers the system by tracking the attendance and location of students. This IoT-based system enables both school administration and parents to track safety and conditions inside the school bus in real-time. It makes the traditional tracking system more efficient, secure, and reliable. By combining GPS, GMS, and RFID technologies, the modern school bus tracking system provides greater transparency in operations. Share in detail about the features that are embedded in a modern school bus tracking system. Modern school bus tracking systems are equipped with a range of features that make them more secure, efficient, and reliable than traditional tracking systems. Some of the key features of a modern school bus tracking system are: What are the Challenges of IoT application in public transportation? While IoT has brought significant advancements in public transportation systems, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the major challenges is the issue of data privacy and security. With the collection of sensitive information such as passenger location and behavior, there is a potential risk of this data being accessed by unauthorized parties, leading to privacy breaches and cyber-attacks. The implementation of IoT systems also requires significant expertise and technical knowledge, which may be a challenge for some transportation agencies. Moreover, these systems require a reliable internet connection, and in remote areas with limited network coverage, the systems may not function optimally. There is also the challenge of interoperability and standardization. With the deployment of IoT systems by different vendors, there is a lack of standardization in the protocols and communication mechanisms used by these devices, which can make it challenging to integrate the systems with existing infrastructure. The adoption of industry-wide standards and protocols can help address this challenge and ensure seamless integration of IoT systems in public transportation. Despite the above challenges the advantages of IoT outweigh the risks and IoT for school bus monitoring is growing rapidly. How does Aeris’ School Bus Management Platform help in transforming the mobility space in India? Aeris IoT-based School Bus Management Platform is a comprehensive solution that utilizes IoT technology to address the safety concerns associated with school transportation in India and provides easy-to-use route creation. The platform integrates various technologies such as GPS, GMS, RFID, and sensors to offer real-time monitoring and control of school buses. With the help of this platform, school administrators and parents can track the bus location, route, speed, and other important information in real-time. They can also get alerts and notifications regarding any security breach or deviation from the scheduled route, enabling them to take immediate action. The platform also offers advanced features such as attendance tracking, driver behavior monitoring, and fuel consumption management. It enables schools to optimize their bus routes, minimize fuel consumption, and reduce overall transportation costs. It also provides a user-friendly dashboard that can be accessed via desktop or mobile devices, making it easy for parents and school administrators to monitor the transportation process from anywhere at any time.

    "article_content": "How does Intuit strengthen a platform of culture and collaboration in innovation throughout the organization? At Intuit, our principles of Customer-Driven-Innovation (CDI) and Design-for-Delight (D4D) have helped us nurture the culture of innovation for several decades. While these principles provide clarity and guidelines, the passion every employee has for delivering unparalleled customer experiences is the key towards consistently building a highly collaborative organizational culture. To scale a collaborative culture to 17K+ employees globally also requires organizational structure and commitments. At Intuit, we have a very successful trend of passionate employees leaning forward and establishing tech-communities to engage like-minded individuals and drive impactful outcomes for our customers and employees. Open-source is one such tech-community where technologists contribute towards building a strong mindset and skill set in the organization towards open-source technologies and best practices. Several programs are driven by this community including project identification for opensouring, educating on the process and technical how-tos for the first timers, spreading awareness on the benefits of open sourcing among other events. Hacktoberfest is one such event that is held every year during October globally across all Intuit sites. Not just the seasoned developers, but even the college graduates who are in the first year of their careers enthusiastically participate and contribute to this month-long effort of contributing to an open-source project of their choice. Experts also lend their hand in mentoring the first-timers during such events enabling the organization to build on our learn-teach-learn culture. The contributors take away exciting rewards and are also recognized company-wide. Apart from this, Intuit also has a week-long event called Global Engineering Days (GED) which is an opportunity for technologists to use their voice and feel empowered to lead, contribute and solve big customer problems. During this time, technologists get to focus solely on areas of passion – a bug they are eager to fix, a feature they’ve wanted to add, a tool we need to integrate, a flow that needs fixing. Typically, engineers leverage GED for creating/improving any of their OSS projects, coming up with new ideas and implementing it, or just enhancing their technical prowess by exploring new technologies. We have the next GED coming up in May 2023, and we’re really excited to see the amount of innovation that comes out of it! How can organisations successfully adopt an open-source mindset collaboratively? Transforming an organization towards open-source culture is a humongous task. It could also be a delight if we have clarity on the benefit to customers and the employees. We take pride in helping our employees understand what’s in it for them and our customers by adopting open-sourcing. On the customer front, speed to deliver customer benefit is significantly fueled by emphasizing re-usability of all capabilities. We are a capability-driven company where every team builds capabilities that provide customer benefit. On the employee front, capabilities that are aligned with open-source principles also offer flexibility for employees across the organization to contribute towards building newer functionalities that can be scaled to multiple product offerings at speed. At Intuit, these mindsets are tightly coupled with architectural principles and leadership sponsorship to ensure a high say/do ratio. Capability definition and ownership helps us deliver customer benefit at speed as we emphasize re-use and avoid clones. We have guidelines on incorporating open-source principles while building these capabilities. We call it “inner-sourcing”. There are defined principles, goals and measures on how each of our capabilities are incorporating inner-sourcing guidelines. Building self-serve APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with appropriate Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Unit/Integration test coverage, documentation etc are just a few examples of how a capability can be ready for contributions from the rest of the organization. As employees mature in building and contributing to the inner-source enabled capabilities, we have witnessed significant interest and passion towards open sourcing a few of these capabilities to extend the benefit to industry as a whole. What challenges do organizations face in leveraging open-source technology among teams and individuals? The first challenge in leveraging an open-source technology is to explore the OSS project for their specific use-case, through a Proof of Concept (POC). This involves understanding the current state of implementation & basic checks on whether the, OSS projects have good documentation, user guides & contribution guidelines for different personas to get started with the project – however, evaluating the POC for the specific problem statement is still the onus of the respective organization. Once the POC is successful, the next challenge comes in the form of scale. The scale handled currently by the OSS project might be way different from the scale expected by the enterprises for their specific use cases, which results in enterprises tweaking their architecture while adopting the OSS project (or) for the OSS project to scale up at a speed that works for their customers. With POC evaluations & scale figured out, the third challenge comes in the form of adoption & integration with the internal/enterprise tool ecosystem already being used by the organization. This means that teams have to write code, which is custom to their enterprise – to integrate the OSS project & the internal tools. Finally, once enterprises have adopted the OSS project, the last challenge comes in the form of run-the-business (RTBs). This could involve requiring dedicated/expedited support – for functional logic bugs, security defects, etc. But the great opportunity in most of these challenges is that these challenges have to be solved centrally in just one place, and anyone from the open source community can contribute these patches to the OSS project! Tell us in detail about the open-source innovation projects currently at Intuit and the efforts put in to accelerate their success. One of the landmark examples of successful open-source projects at Intuit is Argo. Argo was born to enable scale with developing and running applications in the public cloud. At Intuit, we have widely adopted the Kubernetes-native workflow engine to run complex workflows which quickly grew as Intuit built Argo and the different projects within Argo , including Argo CD, Argo Rollouts, Argo Events & Argo Workflows, etc. We have our platform on top of Kubernetes called IKS (Intuit Kubernetes Services). Through IKS, Argo CD & Argo Rollouts have now become the backbone for any microservice deployment strategy at Intuit. Another success story that showcases what to expect in the future is the Argo Events & Workflows. The Batch Processing Platform (BPP) at Intuit handles scheduling, orchestration & runtimes for all Big Data jobs. Internally, BPP leverages Argo Events & Workflows to provide the scheduling & orchestration capabilities. We’re looking to onboard and adopt all of Intuit’s scheduled jobs onto BPP and scale up the Argo Workflow usage by at least 17x growth at Intuit in the upcoming 1-2 years. At Intuit, we’re actively scouting for potential open-source projects within each business unit to see what can be a shared solution that works for folks outside Intuit. So far in 2023, we’ve already open-sourced the Spring Pulsar client & Apollo mock HTTP projects from Intuit India! What are some Open-Source technology trends that can play a critical role in organizations in 2023? Increased adoption of open-source technology will continue to enhance existing open-source software. As enterprises continue to use Kubernetes and other container orchestration platforms, we expect them to run into issues that were not solved earlier, resulting in new and innovative solutions that will eventually be open-sourced. From a security point of view, we expect enterprises to enhance their screening of open-source software used to avoid vulnerabilities like log4shell, which in turn would make the existing open-source software solutions more secure. Regarding hosting, we expect innovations around API acceleration and edge computing to reduce API latency. Service Mesh providers like ISTIO have simplified their offerings by moving to a shared node agent (Ambient Mesh) instead of injected proxy containers, which opens up huge savings in hosting costs. From a programming point of view, we expect an increase in open-source contributions around programmable proxies like Envoy. We can use WebAssembly (WASM) to inject filters at runtime into Envoy proxy and also Envoy-based Service Mesh solutions like ISTIO . We also expect enterprises to continue exploring solutions around HTTP3. With the release of ChatGPT in Nov 2022, we see a lot of interest in generative AI. We expect much more open-source work related to Chatbots and overall increased adoption of ChatGPT to solve problems in software development. Considering the upcoming GenZ batch of new graduates who’re more aware & passionate about open-source, it’s going to be a no-brainer for companies to be more open-source savvy & build a good tech reputation to attract & hire awesome candidates!

    "article_content": "Please emphasize the role distributed workforce plays in today’s age of remote work. As technology continues to advance and global connectivity improves, organizations are realizing the benefits of having a workforce that is distributed across different locations, rather than being confined to a centralized physical office. This approach, which is becoming popular in today’s age of remote work, means that organizations can tap into a vast pool of talent from around the world. Geographical barriers are no longer a constraint, allowing companies to hire the best individuals regardless of their location. This opens up opportunities for diverse perspectives, expertise, and specialized skills that may not be readily available in a single location. A recent survey sponsored by Remote found that in the Asia Pacific region, nearly half of companies plan to hire 20-30% of their remote workforce (including employees and contractors) from other countries over the next 12-18 months. Distributed workforces play a pivotal role in today’s world of work. They enable organizations to access top talent, enhance flexibility and productivity, reduce costs, ensure business continuity, promote sustainability, boost employee satisfaction, and embrace global perspectives. As the modern work landscape continues to evolve, embracing the distributed workforce model can provide organizations with a competitive advantage and pave the way for future success. What are the advantages of adopting a distributed workforce? Embracing a distributed workforce allows companies to tap into a diverse and extensive talent pool. Instead of being limited to a specific geographical area, organizations can hire the best talent from around the world. Access a larger and more diverse talent pool to find specialized talent for hard-to-fill roles. Reduce your operational costs, as you can save on office rent, utilities, equipment, and travel expenses. You can also optimize your payroll and tax compliance by using an employer of record service like Remote. Boost your productivity and performance, as you can offer your employees more flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. You can also leverage different time zones and skills to deliver faster and better results to your customers. Enhance your culture and engagement, as you can foster a sense of trust, collaboration, and belonging among your remote employees. You can also create a more inclusive and diverse environment that values different perspectives and backgrounds. While working remotely, how do remote organizations deal with security concerns? Working remotely is here to stay. In reality, according to McKinsey, nearly 90% of people take advantage of opportunities to work flexibly. The security hazards associated with remote employment are numerous, though. Businesses must be mindful of the danger of becoming victims to cybercriminals who are leveraging the trend to spread malware, forge user credentials, and steal data from unprepared networks. Remote organizations must prioritize security measures to mitigate potential risks and safeguard sensitive information. Here are some key strategies and practices for addressing security concerns while working remotely: Strong authentication and access controls: Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to ensure secure access to company resources and systems. Enforce strong password policies and regularly educate employees on best practices for creating and managing secure passwords. Employ access controls to limit access to sensitive data and systems based on the principle of least privilege. Secure remote connections: Encourage the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt internet connections and provide secure access to company networks and systems. VPNs create a secure tunnel for data transmission, protecting it from unauthorized interception. Endpoint security: Remote workers’ devices should have up-to-date security software, including antivirus and anti-malware solutions. Regularly patch and update operating systems, applications, and firmware to address security vulnerabilities. Data protection and encryption: Emphasize the importance of data protection by encrypting sensitive information both in transit and at rest. Utilize encryption technologies for email communications, file storage, and collaboration platforms. Encourage the use of secure file sharing services that provide end-to-end encryption. By implementing these security measures and fostering a culture of security awareness, remote organizations can effectively address security concerns and minimize the risks associated with remote work. Regular evaluation, testing, and adaptation of security measures are also crucial to ensure ongoing protection in an ever-changing threat landscape. What are the most consequential issues that an employer should consider when determining its post-covid-19 remote work policies? In recent years, there has been a growing demand among employees for greater flexibility in their work arrangements. This desire for flexibility can stem from various factors, including work-life balance, commuting concerns, personal obligations, or even individual productivity preferences. Some employees may prefer to work remotely full-time, while others may seek a combination of remote and on-site work. By accommodating flexible work arrangements, employers can benefit from increased employee satisfaction, improved retention rates, and access to a wider talent pool. Remote work policies are no longer solely within the purview of human resources departments. They have evolved into strategic considerations that impact multiple facets of an organization . Recognizing this shift is crucial for employers. Here are some key areas where remote work policies extend beyond HR: Technology and Infrastructure: Implementing remote work policies requires robust technological infrastructure and support systems. IT departments play a crucial role in ensuring employees have access to secure networks, remote collaboration tools, and reliable communication platforms. Operational Considerations: Companies need to adapt their procedures to accommodate remote work, including task allocation, project management, and team coordination. Management and Leadership: Managers need to be skilled in remote team management, establishing effective communication channels, tracking progress, providing feedback, and fostering team cohesion. Companies that offer remote work options are more likely to attract and retain top performers. Embracing remote work also enables individuals with physical disabilities, caregivers, and those who live far beyond the commuting distance of the office to join the team. By recognizing that remote work policies extend beyond HR, organizations can take a holistic approach to create a supportive and flexible work environment that meets both employee needs and business objectives. This requires collaboration across various departments and a thorough understanding of the operational, technological, cultural, and legal implications of remote work. Is there a threshold to determine when working remotely (from home or otherwise) requires local rules to apply? Whether the work is done remotely or not, employers must always remain compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, such as rules about work hours, holidays, sick time, and more. If the remote work is being done across borders, then there are significantly more considerations that must be taken into account. These include the employment laws and regulations in both the employer’s jurisdiction and the jurisdiction where the remote employee is based; tax implications for both employer and employee; and ensuring the employee has the legal right to work in the country where they are located. Companies can manage these risks and costs by working with an Employer of Record (EOR), who are set up to help businesses employ people internationally. Do you anticipate a rising trend of employers hiring remote workers as opposed to managing office-based employees who subsequently go remote? The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptance and normalization of remote work. Many organizations that had previously been hesitant to embrace remote work were forced to adopt it as a necessity. Now, more and more companies, which are fully remote like ours, are choosing not to open offices and to go remote-first from the outset. Opting for a fully remote workforce right from the start gives a company the ability to achieve the full benefits of distributed work from the start, rather than achieving only partial benefits or needing to transition at a later point. They can tap into the global talent pool and hire without geographical constraints right from the beginning of their company and accelerate its growth even faster. Building a strong sense of team and fostering employee engagement is crucial when managing remote workers. Employers should invest in virtual team-building activities, online social interactions, and opportunities for remote employees to connect and collaborate. This also enables the company to establish an intentional, inclusive global culture where remote work is not just a temporary or secondary option but is deeply ingrained in the company’s culture, operations, and workflows from the very beginning. What practical issues should employers bear in mind when considering remote hiring? When considering remote hiring, employers should be mindful of several practical issues to ensure success. Here are some key considerations: Legal and compliance: Employers should be aware of all the legal and compliance requirements. This includes understanding the employment laws, tax regulations, benefits, and data privacy laws in the remote worker’s location. Time zone and communication challenges: If you are hiring a team that spans different time zones, employers need to consider how to facilitate effective communication and address potential challenges arising from time zone differences. Working asynchronouslyis one of the most effective ways to operate in a remote environment. Onboarding and training: Remote onboarding and training processes should be well-structured and tailored to remote employees. Employers need to establish effective methods for virtual onboarding, providing remote-specific training materials, and ensuring new hires feel connected and supported. Performance management and accountability: Establishing clear performance metrics, goals, and expectations is crucial for remote workers. Employers should have mechanisms in place to measure and evaluate remote employees’ performance, including regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and performance reviews. Team culture, collaboration and cohesion: Building a sense of teamwork and cohesion among remote employees is important. Employers should foster opportunities for social interaction and utilize collaboration tools to facilitate effective remote collaboration and engagement. Employee well-being and support: Remote employees may face unique challenges related to work-life balance, isolation, and burnout. Employers should prioritize employee well-being, offering resources for mental health support, promoting work-life balance, and fostering a supportive and inclusive remote work culture. Cultural and diversity considerations: Remote hiring allows employers to access talent from different cultures and backgrounds. Employers should be mindful of cultural differences, adapt their communication styles, and foster an inclusive work environment that values diversity. By addressing these practical issues, employers can create a conducive environment for remote workers and set them up for success. It is important to continuously evaluate and refine remote work practices based on feedback, lessons learned, and evolving needs to optimize the remote hiring experience.

    "article_content": "In a competitive market, how do you position yourself as a key differentiator when it comes to marketing strategies? A perpetually competitive market and volatile macro environment is presenting significant challenges in front of marketers to deliver incremental value on the marketing spend. Carefully crafted marketing strategies play a significant role in creating and maintaining brand leadership, drive growth and business expansion goals, execute thoughtful PR and Communications programs, help meaningfully amplify key initiatives such as CSR and DEI, and supports hiring and recruitment marketing plans. Therefore, marketing and brand communications strategies must be systematically aligned to these corporate objectives and these strategies should be aided by required technology and tools for efficient execution and systematic measurement. At Acuity, the Marketing and Communications team has created a unique position as a value creator and growth driver for the business. Our marketing strategies are tuned to help various business lines grow in our addressable markets. We play a pivotal role in active client acquisition and help expand into new markets and newer customer segments. Systematic and disciplined execution of these strategies has helped us contribute over 15% of total new sales annually and we consistently deliver the highest number of new logos to the business year after year. Not just sporadic growth, we are acutely focused on maximizing customer lifetime value and maximizing ROI on marketing investments, year after year. Beyond growth objectives, our marcom strategies have helped Acuity create a strong brand identity and visibility as the world’s leading provider of tech-enabled be-spoke research and analytics solutions provider to the global financial services industry. Our thought leadership and content marketing strategies, which is an integral part of the overall marketing priorities, have helped us establish our rich domain expertise and engage with senior decision makers, effectively. We have grew exponentially over these years, and we did that in a responsible manner by giving back to the society where we operate and by focusing on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs across our locations. Marketing continues to play a significant role in expanding our DEI ecosystem, amplifying our corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and translated our employee volunteering programs into meaningful storytelling helping Acuity to become a truly respected brand and a great place to work. Role of tech in Marketing – What is the future of Generative AI in Marketing? From a CMO’s point of view, tech is not just an enabler, it works as an accelerator to generate greater value for marketing and at the same time elevates customer’s overall experience of the brand. Along those lines, Generative AI has the potential to further compliment key CMO priorities – which is value creation and customer delight. I will specifically highlight five areas which will see significant adoption and impact of Generative AI in marketing. One, Personalization – with various AI models and tools, marketers can create hyper-personalized and engaging content. Growth marketers can expect greater campaign efficiency, boost productivity of demand generation campaigns and execute highly targeted and effective campaigns across channels such as email campaigns, social media posts, or even product recommendations on e-commerce platforms. Second, Segmentation – marketers can now get better at predicting consumer behavior and read customer preferences more accurately, leading to better customer segmentation and tailored advertising strategies. Hyper-targeted advertising can be used to target ads to specific groups of people based on their interests, demographics, and even past purchase behavior. Third is Creativity – in a world where UX is already playing a decisive role in consumer buying behavior, we are already seeing tons of evidence of the magic generative AI can create using simple prompts and these were previously unimaginable. AI can create compelling visuals, videos, and written content. With the power of AI, we expect lower human dependency and minimal interventions which significantly saves time and resources. This could help businesses to create more engaging and visually appealing marketing materials. Fourth, Campaign efficiency – Generative AI can automate many campaigns related tasks such as creating content, keywords, and audience, identifying target accounts, suggesting demographics, and generating reports. Last yet important, I will talk about Chatbots which is already seeing heightened adoptions across industries and customer segments. With well trained models, companies are already seeing the AI powered chatbots delivering outstanding personalized experiences, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention with tasks such as customer service, and product recommendations. Discuss the importance of using Generative AI in organizations to optimize marketing campaigns? Generative AI tools can help significantly optimize marketing campaigns and provide a competitive edge in today’s dynamic business landscape. Let’s look at some of the finer details. Generative AI can create compelling ad copies by analyzing past successful ads and identifying patterns that resonate with the target audience. This helps marketers generate engaging and relevant title and description of ad copies, that drives higher conversions. The value generated by Large Language Models and AI in audience targeting is even greater. It is particularly beneficial for marketers pointedly leaning on LinkedIn ads where the job titles, seniority levels and types of companies that needs to be targeted are suggested based on the advertiser’s product. AI has the capabilities to make the targeting process nimbler by analyzing the product and helps identify the most relevant audience segments. For those who are great fans of Google ad platform and Amazon-sponsored ads, AI tools can materially add value to the campaign teams with suggested keywords for target search terms for a given product or service. Those who know how campaigns technically work, Generative AI tools are significantly handy to suggest negative keywords to prevent irrelevant clicks and improve ad relevance and campaign efficiency. I want to touch a little on the additional fire power Large Language model bring on to the table for Content Creation that help build brand, attract customers, create superlative selling propositions and not to miss, help brand tell a great story. Marketers can smartly and creatively use Large Language Models and Generative AI to automate the content generation process, producing a wide range of visuals and video assets quickly, which is helpful content for a wide range of digital and social media platforms. What are the challenges marketers face while using AI? While AI and Large Language Models presents numerous benefits for marketers, it also comes with its fair share of challenges. To put things in perspective, AI models heavily rely on data for training and accurate predictions. Insufficient or poor-quality data can lead to biased results and inaccurate insights, hampering the effectiveness of AI-driven campaigns. Therefore, marketers must be prudent about the data quality and quantity they are feeding to the model. While data privacy and information security are already a perpetual focus for marketers; AI has taken the focus on data privacy and security to a whole new level. Marketers and allied teams handling vast amounts of customer data raises privacy and security concerns. Marketers must be even more vigilant and mindful as they navigate strict regulations and ensure data protection policies and infrastructure are in the right place to maintain consumer trust. Then comes Interpretability and Explainability challenges. Complex AI models like deep learning can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging for marketers to explain the reasoning behind AI-generated recommendations to stakeholders. Not everyone’s cup of tea, I suppose. The last one I will probably mention is on the Domain Expertise of AI models. Large language models and AI tools may not be fully ready to understand the nuances of specific industries, markets, and customer segments. Human expertise and interventions are critically essential for contextual understanding and refining AI-driven strategies. We acknowledge the current challenges, but AI is rapidly evolving. As Generative Technology matures and begin to address questions around explainability, privacy, security, ethics, and their propensity for ‘hallucinations’. As we move ahead, I am optimistic that they will become a key tool in supporting Marketers generate even greater business value and outcomes. Briefly share Acuity’s key engagement strategies to connect with the audience. We run various integrated marketing programs to connect with our audience. We leverage both online/digital and off-line channels. We have an engaging website which is central to our digital presence. We focus on producing best-in-class client focused thought leadership content such as topical blogs, whitepapers, surveys and trend reports, podcasts, newsletters, videos, and other content assets. We have a strong social media presence and followership, which we are extremely proud of, and we have leading presence across all important social platforms. We focus on events too. We have our own large and small format events that we run in the US, European and Asia Pacific markets. Our webinars are widely attended for it brings industry leaders, practitioners and client speakers to discuss most relevant topics and issues impacting the financial markets. Physical and in-person third party events are back in relevance since late 2022. These events, albeit expensive are a great platform to demonstrate thought leadership and meet and interact with potential customers and clients. For recruitment marketing, employer branding and alumni programs, we create distinct and differentiated content then that of customer focused content and the choice of digital and social media channels varies too. For example, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are apt for recruitment marketing. What are the planned marketing initiatives of Acuity Knowledge Partners for 2023-24? For 2023-24, we will continue to focus on customer-centric, solution focused and geographically aligned marketing strategy and go-to-market programs. Considering Acuity is still a young brand, we will continue to focus on building the brand globally and regionally. To drive this strategic objective, we plan to align our resources and focus on impactful PR & Communications, run events, and content marketing programs. Growth marketing will always be a key focus and we will continue to explore new demand generation programs and channels to maximize our reach through 2023-24 and beyond. To boost marketing productivity, efficiency and effectiveness, marketing technology and tools will play a significant role. We expect to try new tools and technologies, including Large Language models and Generative AI tools in relevant functions within marketing. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Can you provide an overview of EDB’s mission and how it contributes to the open-source community, specifically with regards to the PostgreSQL database? EDB builds Postgres, alongside a vibrant, independent community. As one of the industry’s largest contributors to Postgres, EDB empowers businesses to deploy Postgres anywhere that fits their strategy, without vendor lock-in, with options for distributed Postgres and Oracle compatibility. Our Postgres solutions are designed to help enterprises build new modern applications and help dislodge and replace legacy database incumbents to make Postgres the preeminent standard. From self-managed private clouds to fully-managed public clouds, EDB delivers customers the most complete and robust Postgres solutions in the industry. Postgres is known for its performance and developer-friendly features. How does EDB enhance and optimize the Postgres experience for enterprise-level clients? Developers pick Postgres more than any other database for its technical superiority compared to legacy and proprietary systems. EDB delivers our customers the most complete and robust Postgres solutions in the industry, from Postgres in self-managed private clouds to fully-managed public clouds. This has resulted in Postgres becoming the most prolifically deployed database in modern data architectures. EDB is uniquely positioned to address the complex needs of enterprise-grade workloads, delivering distributed Postgres, unmatched Oracle compatibility, extreme high availability, and support for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments – all with support from the company that knows Postgres better than any other. EDB’s commitment to training and education also empowers enterprise teams to effectively leverage Postgres capabilities. Through collaboration with enterprises and tailored solutions, EDB solidifies Postgres as a compelling choice for businesses seeking a powerful, reliable, and adaptable open source database solution. With many database options available in the market, what are the unique advantages that Postgres, along with EDB’s solutions and services, offers to businesses? Postgres is the database for enterprise applications. Purpose built for general use, Postgres powers enterprises across a wider variety and broader spectrum of applications than any other database, making it the economic game changer for data. There will always be specialty applications that require specialty databases. But for an enterprise standard, developers and IT executives rely on Postgres for the widest range of support. With EDB, the power of Postgres is significantly enhanced to deliver unmatched flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. Our capabilities in Oracle compatibility, distributed Postgres and support for multi cloud and hybrid cloud environments are true differentiators, contributing to EDB’s growth as a top-4 fastest growing DBMS vendor, according to Gartner. We have the largest concentration of Postgres technologists and developers and are uniquely positioned to support the complex data demands of mission-critical applications. More than a vendor, we are an indispensable business partner for our customers. We continue to champion innovations that deliver greater value for our customers, including: Could you share some examples of real-world cases (India Region) where EDB software and services have helped companies improve their database management and operations? EDB also has a dominant workforce to support the local needs that spread across the product engineering, support and professional services based out of India. With more than 300 dedicated developers, and more than 30 percent of Postgres code contributions, EDB is one of the major contributors to Postgres in this open source technology. One real-world use case where EDB’s solutions helped companies improve their database management and operations is, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, a private life insurance company in India that provides insurance products for investment planning and financial security. The Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance was having issues with their legacy core insurance platform system due to it limiting the deployment of new capabilities and services and the rising support and licensing costs had become untenable. The company needed a new system that was built on a modern, open platform and that would not compromise on performance. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance deployed EDB Postgres Advanced, our enterprise class PostgreSQL offering, with operational support. We worked with our partner Chemtrols Infotech to create the design needed to meet the performance and business requirements of the organization and assisted with its deployment. As a result, The Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance had a seamless transition with no service interruption and their customers were not even aware of the major upgrade. After this transition, PostgreSQL effortlessly handled both regular loads and seasonal periods of higher transactions and the higher performance made it possible to deliver key business statistics in real time and support data driven decisions for the company. This change also significantly reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) with no compromise in database performance. Open-source technologies can sometimes raise concerns about support and security. How does EDB address these concerns for its clients while working with an open-source database like Postgres? EDB is the first company to deliver Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Postgres with Oracle compatibility as well as flexible deployment and unmatched management and support for enterprises. TDE acts as a powerful enhancement for cloud storage security, as it encrypts data at the database level. This approach empowers database administrators (DBAs) with control and authority over data access while thwarting unauthorized entry. EDB’s comprehensive solutions assist organizations in establishing resilient architectures that effectively mitigate threats and substantially diminish the risk of security breaches. This significance is underscored by Gartner’s 2023 CIO and Technology Executive Agenda, which highlights that information security remains a top concern for IT decision-makers. The Postgres community is dynamic and rapidly growing. As one of the top contributors, how does EDB foster collaboration and innovation within this community? As one of the major contributors to Postgres in this open-source technology, EDB employs several strategies to foster collaboration and fuel innovation within this ecosystem. EDB actively engages in open and transparent communication with the broader community. By sharing insights, knowledge, and expertise, EDB encourages open dialogue and the exchange of ideas among community members. EDB contributes code, enhancements, and bug fixes to Postgres source code. These contributions not only improve the overall quality of the software but also demonstrate EDB’s commitment to advancing the community’s collective goals. A few of the projects that we have recently contributed to include: pgAdmin, Barman, repmgr, and pgBouncer. One of our most exciting developments in PostgreSQL 15 was introducing the MERGE command in 2022, which makes it easier for enterprises to migrate from expensive, legacy databases to open source. We also improved database security features, enhanced backup and recovery options and advanced logical replication capabilities. EDB has always worked closely with the Postgres community and continued to do so in this upgrade. Can you discuss the role of EDB in terms of providing training, support, and resources for organizations looking to adopt Postgres as their primary database solution? Recently, EDB began offering all of our -on-demand training resources for free. As of spring of 2023, EDB has trained more than 30,000 Postgres users and has helped more than 2,500 become Postgres certified and was ranked one of the best Postgres certification programs by Datamation. Empowering developers, database administrators, and architects to unlock the full potential of Postgres. The free modules are designed to cater to different skill levels, all the way from beginners to advanced users, and also cover a wide range of topics including database administration, SQL programming, and application development. Our training is delivered through a combination of online courses, webinars, and interactive workshops, making it accessible and convenient for anyone to learn at their own pace. These trainings and classes also help Postgres professionals prepare for EDB’s certification exams for both EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. EDB offers comprehensive training and documentation to empower customers with the knowledge and skills required to optimize their experience with the new database system. By combining robust migration tools, meticulous planning, expert guidance, and ongoing support, EDB strives to make the migration process as efficient and painless as possible for its customers. How does EDB assist organizations in migrating from their existing database systems to PostgreSQL-based solutions seamlessly? Our business strategy, along with our Go-To-Market (GTM) approach, has been crafted to eliminate barriers for our enterprise customers. The heart of our product strategy is focused on three primary drivers: Oracle compatibility, implementing distributed Postgres, and providing expert tools and extensions for Postgres including capabilities for hybrid and multi cloud. Earlier this year, we introduced the EDB Guaranteed Postgres Migration Program, which presents a risk-free pathway for companies to transition from Oracle to Postgres. This shift not only offers potential savings of up to 80% on software, support, and maintenance costs but also allows a seamless transformation, as we ensure that EDB Postgres mirrors the look, feel, and functionality of Oracle. This means customers won’t have to start from scratch or rewrite applications. Whether they are aiming to cut database management expenses, enhance business flexibility, drive cloud innovation, or modernize data infrastructure, our Oracle-compatible solution is designed to simplify our customer migration process. As our customers migrate from Oracle, they gain access to tools and enhancements that elevate performance, fortify security, and deliver the promises of cloud technology. Our most recent product release introduced substantial improvements to EDB BigAnimal, enabling immediate deployment across leading cloud platforms. This release addresses the pressing demand from our customers to swiftly construct and deploy Postgres clusters on any major cloud, either within the customer’s account or through BigAnimal’s dedicated cloud account. This process is streamlined, avoiding complex and protracted sales procedures. Additional product innovations include a focus on security and compliance through Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), as well as efforts to improve operational resiliency and scalability through extreme high availability.

Blubirch’s end-to-end approach ensures that all aspects of the reverse supply chain process are efficiently managed, eliminating inefficiencies. This comprehensive and integrated solution optimizes operations throughout the returns management process. By providing a customer-centric returns experience, Blubirch’s solution aims to elevate customer satisfaction. With timely updates and efficient handling of returns, customers are more likely to be satisfied with their interactions, fostering brand loyalty, positive word-of-mouth recommendations and potential repeat business. Can you describe the key features and functionalities of reverse supply chain software in managing product returns and exchanges? Reverse supply chain software provides businesses with a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing product returns and exchanges. It enables companies to initiate and manage return authorizations, automating the validation process to ensure only eligible products are accepted. Real-time tracking and visibility features offer insights into the status of returned products, enabling businesses to identify problems and improve overall efficiency. The software also includes functionality for product inspection and grading, helping determine if returned items can be resold, refurbished or disposed of. The software manages the refurbishment process for repairable items, tracking repair status and progress until products are ready for resale. The warranty management functionality automatically checks warranty coverage and enforces policies for replacements or repairs, ensuring customers receive appropriate service. Integrating with inventory management, the software maintains accuracy of stock levels for products that have been returned and replaced, preventing inventory discrepancies and stockouts. Additionally, it facilitates proper disposal of products that cannot be resold or repaired, adhering to environmental regulations. Comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities provide valuable insights into returns trends and customer behaviour, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve operations. The software integrates with other systems such as CRM, ERP, e-commerce platforms and shipping carriers, ensuring smooth workflow and scalable operations. It also addresses compliance requirements by managing industry regulations, product recalls and legal obligations related to returned items. The reverse supply chain software streamlines the returns process, promotes efficiency and enhances business customer satisfaction. Does the software support automated returns processing and provide real-time tracking of returned items? The reverse supply chain software supports automated returns processing and provides real-time tracking of returned items. It is a key feature of the software, enabling businesses to monitor returned products’ status and location throughout the reverse supply chain process. This visibility enables businesses to identify glitches, track turnaround times and make informed decisions to optimize operations. Automated returns processing involves: This automation helps streamline the returns process, reduces manual intervention and improves efficiency. How does the reverse supply chain software handle product inspection and determine whether an item can be refurbished, repaired or recycled? In the reverse supply chain, the AI/ML-based algorithms in the software conduct a thorough inspection based on predefined criteria when products are returned. This inspection assesses the condition of each returned item to determine the appropriate course of action. If the product is in relatively good condition but requires minor improvements, it is categorized as refurbishable. In such cases, the software initiates cosmetic enhancements and other necessary repairs to restore the product to a new condition. For items that need more significant repairs to become functional again, the software assigns them to repair management. It tracks the repair process, assigns tasks to repair facilities and monitors progress until the product is restored. Some returned items may be damaged beyond repair or are no longer functional. The software identifies these irreparable items for recycling or proper disposal. By doing so, the software ensures that environmentally responsible practices are followed, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Can you elaborate on how the software ensures data security and privacy during the reverse supply chain process, especially when dealing with returned electronics or devices? The reverse supply chain software ensures data security and privacy while handling returned electronics or devices through robust measures. It employs encryption techniques to protect sensitive data during transmission and storage, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals. Stringent access controls are implemented, granting specific permissions based on user roles to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Customer privacy is safeguarded through data anonymization, removing identifiable information while allowing for operational insights. Secure data deletion mechanisms are in place to irreversibly wipe data from returned devices, preventing data leakage or unauthorized access. Secure logistics and encrypted communication channels ensure data protection during transportation. Compliance with data protection regulations and regular security audits enhance the system’s security. If a third-party is involved, risk assessments provide their adherence to strict data security and privacy standards. These measures collectively instil customer trust, minimize data breach risks and uphold legal responsibilities in data handling. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Can you provide an overview of what Ecobillz is and how it functions as a SaaS-based digitization platform? Ecobillz was established in 2016 as an innovative AI-led digitization and automation SaaS platform offering comprehensive modules such as digital check-in/check-out, Account Receivables (AR), Income Audits, E-Invoicing, C-form automation, etc. This platform captures, reads and accumulates documents and data in real-time, which is used for document management systems, advanced business process automation and to churn the data for generating valuable insights of any business. The key component of this B2B SaaS platform is that it was built to eliminate the use of paper by providing innovative real-time digital solutions and automating backend operations. The main advantage of Ecobillz is that it requires no change in the existing software or process of the organization. Hotels, therefore, can quickly adopt Ecobillz without making any changes to their existing systems and processes. Over the years, Ecobillz has forayed into multiple domains such as hospitality, hospitals, automotive etc. Today, Ecobillz is being used in more than 150+ premium luxury hotels all across India and abroad. Ecobillz has a strong mission to help large organizations adopt advanced digitization using AI in order to increase productivity with process automation and data mining with the aim to save trees and time—thus transforming businesses to become more responsible. Why is AI of utmost importance to the hospitality industry? Customers today demand the best possible hospitality experience. This is only possible if the staff is well-versed with its customer base. Ecobillz’s AI-enabled application plays a major role in churning out all the details about the customers from their previous visits assisting the staff in instantly creating a customised package with their preferred room location, food and beverage choices and preferences, etc. This technology also ensures accurate billing, availing discounts, upgrading customers to premium memberships among various other factors. This in itself heightens the hospitality experience. Customers’ feedback is also registered for future use to help the hotel staff serve accordingly despite changes in the workforce. Ecobillz’s data and analytics-based technology has been integrated into every major hotel chain across the country to heighten the hospitality experience. AI is also being implemented in the hospitality industry for payment technologies, automated cleaning services and voice driver smart bots and smart security services. How does Ecobillz differentiate itself from other similar platforms or services in the market? What unique features or offerings does it provide to its users? Ecobillz does not have any competition in the true sense as our services are unique and cannot be compared. Our products are being used by almost all premium hotel chains. The solutions offer a full round package as compared to other offering in the market that are disconnected and one-off solutions. Our unique offerings are designed to be the least intrusive and can be integrated into the existing system as a plug-n-play digitization module requiring no change in the existing system. As the platform magically works with any PMS and POS software without requiring any tight integration, its implementation cost is also minimal.

    "article_content": "Splunk in collaboration with Oxford Economics released a new global report “The Hidden Costs of Downtime,” which highlights the direct and hidden costs of unplanned downtime. The survey calculated the total cost of downtime for Global 2000 companies to be $400B annually, or 9 percent of profits, when digital environments fail unexpectedly. The analysis revealed the consequences of downtime go beyond immediate financial costs and take a lasting toll on a company’s shareholder value, brand reputation, innovation velocity and customer trust. Unplanned downtime — any service degradation or outage of a business system — can range from a frustrating inconvenience to a life-threatening scenario for customers. The report surveyed 2,000 executives from the largest companies worldwide (Global 2000) and showed downtime causes both direct and hidden costs as defined below: The report also highlighted the origins of downtime — 56 percent of downtime incidents are due to security incidents such as phishing attacks, while 44 percent stem from application or infrastructure issues like software failures. Human error is the number one cause of downtime and the biggest offender for both scenarios. However, there are practices that can help reduce downtime occurrences and lessen the impacts of direct and hidden costs. The research revealed an elite group of companies — the top 10 percent — are more resilient than the majority of respondents, suffering less downtime, having lower total direct costs and experiencing minimal impacts from hidden costs. These organisations are defined as resilience leaders and their shared strategies and traits provide a blueprint for bouncing back faster. Resilience leaders are also more mature in their adoption of generative AI, expanding their use of embedded generative AI features in existing tools more than at four times the rate of other organisations. The Combined Direct and Hidden Costs The repercussions of downtime are not limited to a single department or cost category. To provide a multifaceted view, the report surveyed Chief Financial Officers ( CFOs) and CMOs, as well as security, ITOps and engineering professionals to quantify the cost of downtime across several dimensions. Key findings on the impacts of downtime include: Globally, the average cost of downtime per year is more costly for U.S. companies ($256M) than their global counterparts due to various factors including regulatory policies and digital infrastructure. The cost of downtime in Europe reaches $198M, and $187M in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC). Organisations in Europe — where workforce oversight and cyber regulation are stricter — pay more in overtime wages ($12M) and to recover from backups ($9M). Geography also shapes how quickly an organisation recovers financially post-incident. Europe and APAC hold the longest recovery times, while companies in Africa and the Middle East recover the fastest. “Disruption in business is unavoidable. When digital systems fail unexpectedly, companies not only lose substantial revenue and risk facing regulatory fines, they also lose customer trust and reputation,” said Gary Steele, President of Go-to-Market, Cisco & GM, Splunk. “How an organisation reacts, adapts and evolves to disruption is what sets it apart as a leader. A foundational building block for a resilient enterprise is a unified approach to security and observability to quickly detect and fix problems across their entire digital footprint.” Resilience leaders, or companies that recover faster from downtime, share common traits and strategies that provide a blueprint for digital resilience. They also invest more strategically, rather than simply investing more. The resilience leaders’ common strategies and traits include: Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Axis Communications has launched its first explosion-protected thermometric camera specifically designed and certified for use in Zone and Division 2 hazardous locations. The new camera enables remote temperature monitoring to optimize operational efficiency, with a detection range that can extend into Zone and Division 1 hazardous locations. The new thermometric camera have been designed and manufactured by Axis to comply with international explosion-protected standards. The new products follow the Axis’ 2023 launch of the world’s first explosion-protected camera specifically designed for Zone and Division 2 hazardous locations and shows the commitment to expand its explosion-protected offering to further meet customers’ needs. The launch of AXIS Q1961-XTE, the world’s first thermometric camera specifically designed and certified for Zone and Division 2, makes temperature monitoring more accessible to Zone 2/21 and Class I/II/III Division 2 hazardous areas. Up to now, only Zone and Division 1 thermometric cameras have been available, making remote temperature monitoring within hazardous areas cost-prohibitive for many Zone/Division 2 areas. AXIS Q1961-XTE also has the potential to monitor temperature within Zone/Division 1 hazardous locations, even when installed in a Zone/Division 2 area, as a result of the camera’s effective temperature detection range. This capability can decrease hardware costs for sites that currently rely on Zone/Division 1-certified thermometric cameras. The camera’s remote temperature monitoring and automated alert capability enhances operational efficiency by indicating advance warning of overheating equipment. This solution also increases the speed and effectiveness of response compared to using a handheld device, which relies on the manual observation of a specific spot at a specific time. Making this capability accessible to Zone/Division 2 hazardous areas, operational processes within critical infrastructure and industrial environments, such as waste management and recycling, can be optimized and made safer. Compared to static thermometer sensors, the new Axis thermometric camera provides temperature readings across a wide area, giving comprehensive data about machine or application health. AXIS Q1961-XTE can also monitor the temperature of rotating machinery, like conveyors, and its alert algorithms ignore false alarms, such as vehicle exhaust emissions. Temperature readings from the different monitored zones are available in a metadata stream, providing access to temperature statistics over time that allows for trend monitoring. This can optimize operational efficiency by enabling preventative maintenance in reaction to early signs of temperature variations outside of an acceptable deviation, minimizing the potential of unplanned downtime. Operating as a temperature sensor, the camera can also maximize process efficiency by providing real time temperature data to a process control system. AXIS Q1961-XTE Explosion-Protected Thermal Camera can remotely monitor temperatures ranging from -40 °C to 350 °C (-40 °F to 660 °F). The camera provides automatic alerts if the temperature exceeds or falls below a set threshold, and it can send a notification if the temperature increases or decreases too rapidly. AXIS Q1961-XTE features 10 configurable detection areas with automatic alerts, and spot temperature readings can be taken anywhere within the camera’s field of view to identify exact temperatures in specific areas. The camera’s image sensor is an uncooled microbolometer featuring 384×288 pixels, with a pixel size of 17μm in the 8-14μm spectral range. The athermalized lens features a 55° horizontal field of view and a focal length of F1.18. AXIS Q1961-XTE features a thermal accuracy of ±5 °C (±9 °F) below 120 °C (248 °F), and ±15% above 120 °C (248 °F). To protect sensitive information and help prevent unauthorized access, AXIS Q1961-XTE features Axis Edge Vault. This hardware-based platform safeguards the integrity of Axis devices from factory and enables the execution of secure operations based on cryptographic keys. Like AXIS P1468-XLE Explosion-Protected Camera, the world’s first explosion-protected camera specifically designed for Zone and Division 2 hazardous locations, the new Axis thermometric camera includes electrical safeguards against arcs, sparks and overheating, plastic components with enhanced fire-retardant properties, as well as secure cable connections.

    "article_content": "Cloudera announced it has deepened its AI expertise with its acquisition of Verta’s Operational AI Platform. The Verta team will join Cloudera’s machine learning group, reporting to Chief Product Officer, Dipto Chakravarty. With the addition of Verta, Cloudera has further solidified its position in this competitive landscape, acquiring world-renowned talent and technology in AI and ML. The Verta team will draw on their collective expertise to help drive Cloudera’s AI roadmap and enable the company to effectively anticipate the needs of its global customer base. “The future of data management is AI; they go hand-in-hand. Cloudera is acquiring Verta’s AI Operational platform to strengthen our team and accelerate our operational AI capabilities,” said Charles Sansbury, CEO, Cloudera. “We are moving quickly to provide our customers with the technologies they need to drive their data and AI initiatives, and we have no plans to slow down. This is the first of several strategic moves we expect to make as we extend our leadership in data and trusted enterprise AI.” In addition to providing significant AI expertise, Verta’s hybrid and multi-cloud end-to-end AI platform will fuel Cloudera’s ability to serve growing AI demand across its global user base. Founded on research conducted at MIT by Dr. Manasi Vartak, Verta’s former CEO, and then further developed with Dr. Conrado Miranda, Verta’s former CTO, Verta was a pioneer in model management, serving, and governance for predictive and generative AI (GenAI). It addresses one of the biggest hurdles in AI deployments by enabling organizations to effectively build, operationalize, monitor, secure, and scale models across the enterprise. Verta’s technology simplifies the process of turning datasets into custom retrieval-augmented generation applications, enabling any developer—no matter their level of machine learning expertise—to create and optimize business-ready large language models (LLMs). These features—along Verta’s genAI workbench, model catalog, and AI governance tools—will enhance Cloudera’s platform capabilities as it continues to deliver on the promise of enterprise AI for its global customer base. “Good data breeds good models, which is why Verta’s and Cloudera’s technologies are a perfect match,” said Vartak. “Cloudera has the most data under management compared to any other platform in the world, making it the clear choice to bring the vision for our innovations into reality. In lockstep with the Cloudera team, we can and will unlock the promise of organization-wide AI and enrich every user’s journey from data to insights to action.” With 25% of the world’s data under management, Cloudera is the only true hybrid open data lakehouse that brings analytics and AI to business data, on-premises and in multiple clouds, while providing unified governance and security. Cloudera’s open data lakehouse is the foundation for building and deploying AI applications, including chatbots, document summarization, and code generation. Cloudera enables customers to manage data throughout its entire lifecycle, making it easy for them to use it with LLMs and achieve industry firsts or industry bests.

    "article_content": "Tenable Holdings announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Eureka Security, Inc., a provider of data security posture management (DSPM) for cloud environments. Eureka Security helps security teams gain a holistic view into an organisation’s cloud data security footprint, fight policy drift and misconfigurations that put data at risk, and continuously improve their security posture over time. The acquisition is expected to close this month. By adding DSPM capabilities to its CNAPP solution, Tenable will help customers identify key evidence related to cloud data risk, including where sensitive data resides in the cloud, who has access to that data and the severity of the risk posed by potential data compromise. This type of visibility is central to an organisation’s ability to accurately assess its cloud security compliance. In the 2024 Tenable Cloud Security Outlook study, 95% of organizations polled had experienced cloud-related breaches in the previous 18 months. Among those, 92% reported exposure of sensitive data, and a majority acknowledged being harmed by the data exposure. “Eureka Security’s technology will enable Tenable to provide even better prioritisation of cloud risks and identify toxic combinations beyond vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and over-privileged access to include data at risk as well,” said Shai Morag, senior vice president and general manager of Cloud Security, Tenable. “This is another example of how we’re pushing the envelope in cloud security innovation for customers and leading the market forward by developing best-in-class capabilities.” “Eureka Security’s data-centric approach provides the visibility, control and automation needed to navigate the dynamic cloud landscape while ensuring the highest level of security and compliance,” said Liat Hayun, co-founder and CEO, Eureka Security. “We’re excited to join Tenable. Integrating our capabilities into Tenable’s CNAPP offering creates a compelling capability for customers. Tenable also brings an expansive customer base, and strong go-to-market capabilities. We couldn’t have found a better match to help us expand our mission to reduce cloud data risk globally.” The integration of DSPM will round out the current Tenable Cloud Security solution that already includes such key capabilities as unified CNAPP, iron-clad CSPM protection, cloud workload protection and industry-leading CIEM, among others, which will give security teams the context and prioritisation guidance to make efficient and accurate remediation decisions. The Eureka Security DSPM capabilities are expected to be natively integrated into Tenable Cloud Security and its leading CNAPP solution later this year. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on revenue this year. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "According to International Data Corporation (IDC) Quarterly Smart Home Devices Tracker, 4.5 million televisions were shipped to India in 1H23 , an increase of 8% year-over-year (YoY). The frequent sales by e-tailers, multiple new launches/refresh model portfolio by vendors and clearing of old channel inventory, before the festive season starts, fueled the growth in the first half of the year. Share of the online channel grew by 25% in 1H23 YoY reaching 39% driven by online sales festivals. While the popular screen sizes of 32-inch and 43-inch remain mainstream with 71% collective share, the larger screens are gaining popularity. Share of the 55-inch went up to 12% from 9% a year ago in 1H23 resulting in 35% YoY growth in the USD$400+ price segment. Upasana Joshi, Research Manager, Client Devices, IDC India, said, “Due to decreasing prices, consumers are opting to buy an affordable smart TV instead of retrofitting non-smart TV with a streaming stick, which is losing popularity, its shipments declining by 85% in 1H23.” The average selling price (ASP) of smart TVs stood at US$380 in 1H23, a 3% YoY decline. Brands are focusing on low priced models in the budget segment with regular price drops, resulting in share increase of sub-US$200 from 26% to 39% in 1H23. With an array of features and pre-loaded apps, inbuilt storage in the TV is becoming important. 8GB internal storage is most popular, growing by 33% YoY in 1H23. “Apart from core features, visual aesthetics like narrow bezel or bezel-less TVs in the affordable price segments and features like HDR, better DCI-P3 coverage, Dolby certification, improved sound output etc. are in demand.” says Debasish Jana, Market Analyst, Smart Home Devices, IDC India. In 2022, 9.8 million units were shipped to India with a 7% YoY growth. The normalization of panel prices resulting in reducing end consumer prices was the key reason for growth. The low-end price segment (sub-US$200) is most popular, with almost 45% share of 32” screen size models and an overall ASP of US$383 in 2022. IDC expects 2023 to remain flat or register single digit growth led by the upcoming festive season. A plethora of offers/discounts across channels will ensure a healthy second half. 1Q23 Top 5 TV Company Highlights Xiaomi continues to lead the TV market with 14% share in 1H23. Its consistent focus on their TV line up, namely the 5A and Redmi series, cemented their leadership position. In the HD and FHD segment too, Xiaomi leads with 23% share. Samsung stood second with a 13% market share in 1H23. Apart from high-end QLED TVs, its T4000 series within the budget range is high in demand. Samsung is a close second with a 25% share in the 4K TV segment and holds more than 90% share in the 8K TV segment. LG stood third with a 12% share in 1H23. Apart from the budget segment TVs, its Nano cell and OLED TVs are gaining momentum. Nano cell range tends to reduce dependency on the more expensive OLED TV range. Further, LG climbed to top spot in 4K TV segment with 26% share in 1Q23. LG’s in-house manufacturing facility gives it a cost benefit over its competitors. TCL stood fourth with 8% share. Its newly launched S series TV fueled shipment growth in 1Q23. TCL’s Mini-LED TVs are also gaining traction. It has also started panel manufacturing in India. OnePlus stood fifth with 7% share.

    "article_content": "By the end of 2023, Daikin Air-conditioning India will have commenced operations at its third state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in India. The 75-acre new factory, situated in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, will serve as a testament to Daikin’s dedication to innovation and excellence. It is strategically positioned to cater to the increasing demand for state-of-the-art air conditioning products manufactured in India, both domestically and internationally. Daikin is the principal investor in the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) program in the air-conditioning category, which is implemented by the government to encourage domestic production of air conditioners. The establishment of the new factory will substantially increase Daikin’s production capacity, thereby bolstering the expansion of the brand in India & overseas. This expansion is positioned to make a substantial contribution to the continued success of Daikin in India. Residential air conditioner (RAC) volume growth is anticipated to increase significantly by 2025, according to industry reports, indicating substantial growth potential. The present low adoption rate of 7-8% among urban Indian households as a whole is the cause of this, which is considerably lower than the 90% rate observed in developed countries. Moreover, there is a growing trend among consumers to prefer energy-efficient products that have a diminished total cost of ownership. As a result of observing the rapid global proliferation of air conditioners, Daikin increased its investments in India in preparation for the construction of a third manufacturing facility. KJ Jawa, Chairman & MD, Daikin India, said, “The establishment of the new Daikin facilities across India signifies not only the organization’s extravagant commitment to excellence but also a noteworthy achievement in its far-reaching worldwide strategy. With these long-term investments across – People, processes, technology, R&D and skill development, Daikin India envisions to strengthen its standing as the preeminent producer & seller of air-conditioning equipment, refrigeration, purification & compressors throughout India & overseas. Our cutting-edge factory & production standards exemplify the organization’s dedication to environmental stewardship and sustainability, in line with Daikin’s goal of attaining Net Zero carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050. The future factories will be committed to the research and development of environmentally sustainable air conditioning systems for East Africa, West Africa, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh, as well as the Middle East and South America.” Given India’s burgeoning reputation as a dependable manufacturing hub, its favourable policies, progressive government reforms, and streamlined business environment, Daikin India is strategically positioned to capitalise on the anticipated surge in air conditioning demand over the subsequent 5-10 years. Consistent investments and increased production capacity will guarantee that Daikin India remains the undisputed leader in the air conditioning industry, bolstered by its superior products, technology, brand, and distribution.

Mac Studio features M2 Max and the new M2 Ultra, delivering a huge boost in performance and enhanced connectivity in its stunningly compact design. Mac Studio is up to 6x faster than the most powerful Intel-based 27-inch iMac, and up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Mac Studio with M1 Ultra. Mac Pro, now featuring M2 Ultra, combines the unprecedented performance of Apple’s most powerful chip with the versatility of PCIe expansion. Mac Pro is up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Intel-based model. Featuring up to 192GB of unified memory, Mac Studio with M2 Ultra and Mac Pro have far more memory than the most advanced workstation graphics cards, taking on demanding workloads other systems can’t even process. The new Mac Pro completes the Mac transition to Apple silicon and, together with the rest of Apple’s pro systems, gives users the most powerful and capable lineup of pro products Apple has ever offered. Mac Studio and Mac Pro are available to order, with availability beginning Tuesday, June 13. John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, said, “The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro with Apple silicon are the two most powerful Macs we’ve ever made. Mac Studio has been a breakthrough for pros everywhere, and it’s at the heart of hundreds of thousands of home and pro studios across the world. Today, it gets even better with M2 Max and the new M2 Ultra, featuring even more performance and enhanced connectivity. And for those users who need the versatility of internal expansion, Mac Pro combines PCIe slots with our most powerful chip. The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro join our other pro systems to give our users the most powerful and capable lineup of pro products that Apple has ever offered.” Mac Studio: A Performance Powerhouse Mac Studio empowers pros to build the studio of their dreams with its groundbreaking performance and extensive connectivity in a compact form that lives right on their desks.

Mac Pro features seven PCle expansion slots, with six open expansion slots that support gen 4, which is 2x faster than before, so users can customise Mac Pro with essential cards. From audio pros who need digital signal processing (DSP) cards, to video pros who need serial digital interface (SDI) I/O cards for connecting to professional cameras and monitors, to users who need additional networking and storage, Mac Pro lets professionals customise and expand their systems, pushing the limits of their most demanding workflows. Mac Pro: Advanced Connectivity The wide array of connectivity in Mac Pro gets even better with eight built-in Thunderbolt 4 ports — six on the back and two on the top — which is twice as many as before. It supports up to six Pro Display XDRs, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, which come to the new Mac Pro for fast wireless connectivity. Additionally, Mac Pro includes three USB-A ports, two higher-bandwidth HDMI ports that support up to 8K resolution and up to 240Hz frame rates, two 10Gb Ethernet ports, and a headphone jack that enables the use of high-impedance headphones. Better for the Environment The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro are designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both use far less energy than the desktops in their class, and over 40 percent less than the ENERGY STAR efficiency requirement. Mac Studio and Mac Pro are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium, and over 95 percent of the packaging is fiber based. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations and is focused on its Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral. This means every Mac Apple creates, from design to manufacturing to customer use, will have net-zero climate impact. macOS: The World’s Most Advanced Desktop Operating System Designed to take full advantage of Apple silicon, Mac Studio and Mac Pro come with macOS Ventura, delivering breakthrough performance and productivity. Features like Stage Manager make focusing on tasks and moving between apps and windows easier and faster than ever, while Continuity Camera, Handoff in FaceTime, Safari passkeys, and the Freeform app help users be more productive and expressive. Powerful gaming features like MetalFX Upscaling help accelerate gameplay performance with stunning graphics and optimisations for Apple silicon, while pro apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro enable users to tackle more complex projects, all at blazing speeds. Arriving this fall, macOS Sonoma adds powerful features and productivity tools that unlock new ways to get things done on Mac. Dynamic video conferencing features, including Presenter Overlay, elevate the presence of users when showcasing their work during video calls by including them on top of the content they’re sharing. Designed to enable hybrid in-studio and remote pro workflows, macOS Sonoma brings a new high performance mode to the Screen Sharing app, which leverages the advanced media engine in Apple silicon to deliver incredibly responsive remote access, including low-latency audio, high frame rates, and support for reference colour. Users can place widgets right on the desktop, interact with them with just a click, and through the magic of Continuity, use iPhone widgets while they work. Now it’s easy to complete powerful tasks — like running Shortcuts — right from widgets on desktop. Big updates come to Safari, taking productivity on the web to the next level with profiles, which keeps browsing separate between multiple topics or projects, and web apps on Mac, which provide faster access to favourite sites.

    "article_content": "Apple announced iOS 17, a major release that upgrades the communications experience across Phone, FaceTime, and Messages; makes sharing even easier with AirDrop; and provides more intelligent input that improves the speed and accuracy of typing. iOS 17 also introduces new experiences with Journal, an app that makes it easy for people to practice gratitude, and StandBy, a new way to view glanceable information when iPhone is set down and charging. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said, “With iOS 17, we’ve made iPhone more personal and intuitive by deeply considering the features we all rely on every day. Phone, FaceTime, and Messages are central to how we communicate, and this release is packed with updates we think our users are going to love. We’ve also reimagined AirDrop with new ways to share, autocorrect gets even better, and we’re introducing all-new experiences with Journal and StandBy, plus so much more. We can’t wait for everyone to try it.” Major Upgrades to the Phone Experience The Phone app is central to the iPhone experience, and it receives a big update with personalised Contact Posters, providing a new way for users to express themselves. Users can customise how they appear, bringing a completely new look to incoming calls, and choose beautiful treatments for photos or Memoji, as well as eye-catching typography and font colors. Contact Posters will also be available for third-party calling apps. Live Voicemail gives users the ability to see real-time transcription as someone leaves a voicemail, and the opportunity to pick up while the caller is leaving their message. Calls identified as spam by carriers won’t appear as Live Voicemail, and will instead be instantly declined. With the power of the Neural Engine, Live Voicemail transcription is handled on-device and remains entirely private. FaceTime Adds Audio and Video Messages, Reactions, and Extends to Apple TV FaceTime now supports audio and video messages so when users call someone who is not available, they can share a message that can be enjoyed later. FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video calling apps can take advantage of them as well. In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPhone and then hand it off to Apple TV, to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room. A Fresh Look and Big Updates to Messages Messages gets significant updates with iOS 17, including an all-new stickers experience with new emoji stickers and the ability to create Live Stickers by lifting subjects from photos. Users can also add effects to Live Stickers that bring them to life, and a new drawer in the keyboard puts all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iOS. New Messages features enhance the way users communicate. An expandable menu that can be accessed with a simple tap to display iMessage apps gives Messages a sleeker look. Search gets more powerful and precise with search filters, making it possible for users to start a search and add additional filters to narrow down the results and find exactly what they are seeking. A new catch-up arrow indicates where the user last left off in the conversation, and replying inline is as simple as swiping on a text bubble. If a user shares their location, it will update in real time right in the conversation. When sending an audio message, it’s transcribed automatically so users can read it in the moment or listen later. Messages also introduces Check In, an important feature for when a user wants to notify a family member or friend that they have made it to their destination safely. After a user initiates a Check In, their friend or family member will automatically be notified as soon as the user arrives. If they are not making progress toward their destination, useful information will be temporarily shared with the selected contact, such as the device’s location, battery level, and cell service status. Any information shared is end-to-end encrypted. Easier Sharing with AirDrop and NameDrop AirDrop makes it easy to share a file with a colleague or send photos to a friend in seconds, and with iOS 17, AirDrop gets new ways to share. NameDrop allows users to easily share contact information by simply bringing their iPhones together, or by bringing an iPhone and Apple Watch together.1 With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity between iPhone devices. Improvements to Autocorrect and Dictation Deliver More Intelligent Input Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction — improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. It also receives a refreshed design to better support typing, and sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes. Users will now receive predictive text recommendations inline as they type, so adding entire words or completing sentences is as easy as tapping the space bar, making text entry faster than ever. Dictation leverages a new speech recognition model to make it even more accurate. StandBy Displays Glanceable Information While iPhone Is Charging iOS 17 introduces StandBy, giving users a full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. StandBy is perfect on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or desk, and can be personalised to display a range of beautiful clock styles, favourite photos, or widgets, including Smart Stacks, which surface the right widgets at the right time. With support for Live Activities, Siri, incoming calls, and larger notifications, StandBy makes iPhone even more useful when viewed at a distance. When charging with MagSafe, StandBy remembers a user’s preferred view. It is easy to bring up StandBy anytime by tapping the screen, and on iPhone 14 Pro with the Always-On display, it is always available. A New Way to Appreciate Life’s Moments with Journal Journal is a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, which has been shown to improve wellbeing. Using on-device machine learning, personalised suggestions can be provided to help inspire a user’s journal entry. Suggestions are intelligently curated from recent activity, including photos, people, places, workouts, and more, making it easy to start a journal entry, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Apple introduced the 15-inch MacBook Air, the world’s best 15-inch laptop. With an expansive 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, the incredible performance of M2, up to 18 hours of battery life,1 and a silent, fanless design, the new MacBook Air brings power and portability — all in the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop. With an all-new six-speaker sound system, the 15-inch MacBook Air delivers immersive Spatial Audio, along with a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, MagSafe charging, and the power and ease of macOS Ventura for an unrivaled experience. Customers can order starting today, with availability beginning Tuesday, June 13. The 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 gets a new starting price of $1,099 — $100 less than before — to deliver even more value and choice to everyone, from upgraders to first-time Mac customers. “We’re thrilled to introduce the first 15-inch MacBook Air. With its incredible performance and striking design, the new MacBook Air is the world’s best 15-inch laptop. And it’s only possible with Apple silicon,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “From its expansive Liquid Retina display and remarkably thin and fanless design, to extraordinary battery life and an immersive six-speaker sound system, the new MacBook Air has it all.” Brilliant 15.3-inch Liquid Retina Display The new MacBook Air features a spacious, high-resolution 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, so users can see even more content. With up to 500 nits of brightness and support for 1 billion colors, the brilliant Liquid Retina display makes content look remarkably rich and vibrant, and text razor sharp. It is also twice the resolution and 25 percent brighter than a comparable PC laptop. World’s Thinnest 15-inch Laptop The new MacBook Air measures only 11.5mm thin, making it the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop. It weighs just 3.3 pounds, so it’s incredibly portable. Even with its expansive display, the new MacBook Air is solid and durable. And it is also nearly 40 percent thinner and half a pound lighter than a comparable PC laptop. MacBook Air also features MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt ports for connecting accessories and up to a 6K external display, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack for versatile connectivity. It comes in four gorgeous finishes — midnight, starlight, space gray, and silver. Blazing Performance and Tremendous Battery Life with M2 With the M2 chip, the 15-inch MacBook Air has incredible performance. It’s up to 12x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.3 When compared to the best-selling 15-inch PC laptop with a Core i7 processor, the new MacBook Air is up to twice as fast.4 It also delivers extraordinary battery life, with up to 18 hours — 50 percent more than on the PC — even with a better display and better performance.5 The 15-inch MacBook Air features a powerful 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, a 10-core GPU for blazing-fast graphics, and a 16-core Neural Engine. M2 also delivers 100GB/s of memory bandwidth and supports up to 24GB of fast unified memory, so multitasking and working with complex workloads is superfluid. The performance of M2 lets users work, play, or create just about anything — anywhere. 1080p FaceTime HD Camera and Six-Speaker Sound System The 1080p FaceTime HD camera on MacBook Air is perfect for FaceTime calls and video conferencing. Combined with the processing power of the advanced image signal processor on M2, users will look great on video calls. A three-mic array captures clean audio using advanced beamforming algorithms, so users come through loud and clear on video calls. The design of the new 15-inch MacBook Air also features a phenomenal new six-speaker sound system with two tweeters and two sets of force-cancelling woofers. The new speakers deliver twice the bass depth for fuller sound, and Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos provides immersive experiences whether listening to music or watching movies. Powerful Productivity with macOS macOS Ventura takes the Mac experience to a whole new level that helps users achieve even more. Messages and Mail are better than ever, while Safari — the world’s fastest browser on Mac — ushers in a passwordless future with passkeys. Continuity Camera brings video conferencing features to any Mac, including Desk View, Center Stage, and Studio Light. Stage Manager automatically organizes apps and windows, so users can concentrate on the task at hand and still see everything in a single glance. With iCloud Shared Photo Library, users can create and share a separate photo library among up to six family members, and the Freeform app provides a flexible canvas that enables users to be even more productive and expressive. Users can work effortlessly across Mac and iPhone with Continuity features like Handoff, AirDrop, Universal Clipboard, and Messages. macOS Sonoma, coming this fall, makes the Mac experience more delightful and productive than ever, including new ways to personalize with widgets and stunning screen savers, an optimized gaming experience with Game Mode, powerful video conferencing capabilities, a big update to Safari, and more. Better for the Environment The new MacBook Air is designed with the environment in mind, now using 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. MacBook Air also features 100 percent recycled cobalt in the MagSafe connector and 90 percent recycled steel in the battery tray. MacBook Air meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and is focused on its Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral. This means every Mac Apple creates, from design to manufacturing to customer use, will have net-zero climate impact. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Apple announced its latest privacy and security innovations, including major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety, and Lockdown Mode, as well as app privacy improvements. Additionally, Apple introduced new features designed with privacy and security at their core, including Check In, NameDrop, and Live Voicemail. These new efforts are the latest manifestation of Apple’s deeply held belief that privacy is a fundamental human right and that good privacy is built on a foundation of strong security. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said, “Privacy is designed into every new Apple product and feature from the beginning. We are focused on keeping our users in the driver’s seat when it comes to their data by continuing to provide industry-leading privacy features and the best data security in the world. This approach is evident in a number of features on our platforms, like the major updates to Safari Private Browsing, as well as the expansion of Lockdown Mode.” Privacy Features Give Users Greater Control of Their Data Major Updates to Safari Private Browsing Safari introduced private browsing years before any other browser. This year, a significant update provides even greater protection against trackers as users browse the web and from people who might have access to their device. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from using the latest techniques to track or identify a user’s device. Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device. Photos Privacy Permission Improvements A new embedded Photos picker can help users share specific photos with apps while keeping the rest of their library private. When apps ask to access the user’s entire photo library, the user will be shown more information about what they’ll be sharing, along with occasional reminders of their choice. Link Tracking Protection in Messages, Mail, and Safari Private Browsing Some websites add extra information to their URLs in order to track users across other websites. Now this information will be removed from the links users share in Messages and Mail, and the links will still work as expected. This information will also be removed from links in Safari Private Browsing. App Privacy Improvements New tools give developers more information about the data practices of third-party software development kits (SDKs) they use in their apps, allowing them to provide even more accurate Privacy Nutrition Labels. These changes also improve the integrity of the software supply chain by supporting signatures for third-party SDKs to add another layer of protection against abuse. Features Designed to Help Protect User Safety Communication Safety Communication Safety, designed to warn children when receiving or sending photos in Messages that contain nudity, now covers video content in addition to still images. A new API lets developers integrate Communication Safety right into their apps. Additionally, the feature will now help keep kids safe when they’re sending and receiving an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and when using the Phone app to receive a Contact Poster and the Photos picker to choose content to send. All image and video processing for Communication Safety occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content. These warnings will be turned on for the child accounts in their Family Sharing plan, and can be disabled by the parent. Sensitive Content Warning Sensitive Content Warning helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos when receiving them in Messages, an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and the Phone app when receiving a Contact Poster, all using the same privacy-preserving technology at the core of Communication Safety. The feature is optional and can be turned on by the user in Privacy & Security settings. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content. Powerful Security Protections to Safeguard User Data Passwords and Passkeys Updates For easier and more secure password and passkey sharing, users can create a group to share a set of passwords, and everyone in the group can add and edit passwords to keep them up to date. Since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it is end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, one-time verification codes received in Mail will now automatically autofill in Safari, making it easy to securely log in without leaving the browser. Lockdown Mode Lockdown Mode expands to provide even more protections for those who may be targeted by mercenary spyware because of who they are or what they do. New protections encompass safer wireless connectivity defaults, media handling, media sharing defaults, sandboxing, and network security optimizations. Turning on Lockdown Mode further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface for those who need additional protections. Additionally, Lockdown Mode will be supported on watchOS. Additional Features Designed with Privacy and Security at Their Core These features will be coming in free software updates this fall.

    "article_content": "Apple previewed watchOS 10, bringing Apple Watch users a fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps, a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed, and delightful new watch faces. New metrics, Workout Views, and Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrive for cyclists, while new Compass Waypoints and Maps capabilities further help hikers. The Mindfulness app offers additional tools to support mental health. watchOS 10 is available as a developer beta and will be available as a free software update this fall. “watchOS is the world’s most advanced wearable operating system, and it has redefined how people all over the world think of what a watch can do,” said Kevin Lynch, Apple’s vice president of Technology. “watchOS 10 is a major milestone and an energizing new approach for Apple Watch, introducing a fresh new design for quickly viewing information, delightful new watch faces, new features for cyclists and hikers, and important tools for health.” New Design Language and Navigation With watchOS 10, redesigned apps provide more information at a glance, and there are new ways to navigate and quickly access content. “With watchOS 10, we’ve redesigned the interface, allowing users to experience Apple Watch like never before,” said Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design. “The update gives users the information that matters most to them at a glance, simplified navigation, and a new visual language that takes full advantage of the Apple Watch display. We’re also introducing the Smart Stack, offering quick access to proactive and relevant information, right from the watch face.” Apple Watch apps, including Weather, Stocks, Home, Maps, Messages, World Clock, and others, now utilise more of the Apple Watch display for more glanceable information. The Activity app on Apple Watch and the Fitness app on iPhone make tracking daily movement even easier with more details, improvements to sharing, a redesigned trophy case, and Apple Fitness+ trainer tips. A new Smart Stack contains widgets that display timely information that adapts to the user’s context and can be revealed with a simple turn of the Digital Crown from any watch face. For example, at the beginning of the day, Weather will show the forecast, or, when traveling, the Smart Stack will show boarding passes from Wallet. Calendar and Reminders will reshuffle to the top to display upcoming meetings or tasks, and apps that are running, such as Podcasts, will also move up so they are readily available. Smart Stack also enables users to enjoy a beautiful watch face, like Portraits, while still offering a way to quickly access information they care about. Developers can also use the new design language to update their apps. For example, Streaks now utilises the entire display to easily show progress and access tasks, the NBA app makes keeping up with a favourite team even more compelling with team colours and new game details, and with Waterllama’s redesign, users can quickly glance at their hydration from the last seven days with just a turn of the Digital Crown. Control Center is now accessible using the side button, making it easy to quickly open it at any time, over any app. A double-click of the Digital Crown reverts back to any apps used recently. New Watch Faces watchOS 10 introduces two new artistic and joyful watch faces: Palette and Snoopy. The Palette face depicts time in a wide variety of colours using three distinct overlapping layers, and as the time changes, the colours on the display also shift. Additionally, the beloved comic strip Peanuts comes to life on Apple Watch with a new watch face featuring Snoopy and Woodstock. The characters interact and play with the watch hands, react to the weather conditions in the area, or even get active when the user does a workout. Cycling Apple Watch is a great device for cyclists, with features including automatic Workout reminders, calorimetry for e-biking, and Fall Detection. watchOS 10 takes this popular activity even further with advanced new metrics, views, and experiences. When a cycling workout is started from Apple Watch in watchOS 10, it will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and, when tapped, will utilise the full screen. Workout Views, such as Heart Rate Zones, Elevation, Race Route, Custom Workouts, and a new Cycling Speed view, have been optimised for the display size of iPhone, which can be mounted to a bike for convenient, easy viewing during a ride. Apple Watch can now automatically connect to Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories, such as power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors. This enables brand-new metrics, including cycling power (watts) and cadence (RPM), and additional Workout Views, including Power Zones. Bluetooth connection is supported for Indoor and Outdoor cycling workouts, as well as GymKit. New algorithms combining sensor data from Apple Watch and connected power meters can estimate Functional Threshold Power (FTP), the highest level of cycling intensity that a rider could theoretically maintain for an hour. Using FTP, Apple Watch calculates personalised Power Zones, used to easily see the current zone and track how long is spent in each, which is an effective and popular way of improving performance. Hiking The Compass app on Apple Watch is a helpful tool for exploring the great outdoors. With watchOS 10, Compass automatically generates two new waypoints: A Last Cellular Connection Waypoint will estimate the last place with cellular reception, which may be useful for checking messages or making a call. In case of emergencies, a Last Emergency Call Waypoint will estimate where on the route their device had the last connection to any available carrier’s network so that an emergency call can be made. When preparing routes, a new Elevation view uses altimeter data, offering a three-dimensional view of saved waypoints. And starting in the U.S., Apple Maps displays a new topographic map featuring contour lines, hill shading, elevation details, and points of interest. Users can also search for nearby trails and trailheads, with place cards that include detailed information, like trail length, type, and difficulty. Mental Health Mental health is as important as physical health, and research shows that reflecting on state of mind can help build emotional awareness and resilience. With the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10, users can discreetly and conveniently log their momentary emotions and daily moods. Users can turn the Digital Crown to scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes to choose how they are feeling, select what is having the biggest impact on them, and describe their feelings. In the Health app in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, users can see valuable insights to identify what might be contributing to their state of mind — whether it’s associations or lifestyle factors, like sleep or exercise. Additionally, depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics are now easily accessible in the Health app and can help users determine their risk level, connect to resources available in their region, and create a PDF to share with their doctor. Vision Health Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the leading cause of vision impairment globally. To reduce the risk of myopia, the International Myopia Institute recommends children spend at least 80-120 minutes a day outdoors. With watchOS 10, Apple Watch introduces the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor. Users can view this information in the Health app on iPhone or iPad. Time spent in daylight can provide additional benefits to physical and mental health for all ages. And children who do not have their own iPhone can use Family Setup to pair their Apple Watch to their parent’s iPhone, giving parents visibility into the amount of time their kids are spending in daylight with Health Sharing. Viewing something like a device or a book too closely has also been documented as a myopia risk factor. The new Screen Distance feature uses the same TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID in iPad and iPhone to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches for an extended period of time. When a device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all Health app data, including mental health and vision health data, is encrypted. 1 Additional watchOS 10 updates include : Enterprise Apple Watch offers enterprise customers features to enhance productivity and safety in the office or in the field, such as hands-free communication and responding to notifications on the go, or Fall Detection on a job site. watchOS 10 introduces support for Mobile Device Management (MDM), enabling enterprise customers to remotely and centrally install apps and configure accounts on a fleet of devices, with features such as passcode enforcement, and configuring Wi-Fi and VPN settings. With this update, Apple Watch can further help improve employee wellness, productivity and health, and safety monitoring. APIs for Workout App Developers watchOS 10 includes new APIs for workout app developers that will allow them to create compelling new experiences. The powerful motion sensors on both Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra can detect rapid changes in velocity and acceleration, such as when swinging a golf club or a tennis racket. Now, developers will have access to this high-frequency motion data, so apps like SwingVision can analyse serve pronation, which is the twisting motion of the forearm, wrist, and hand, and Golfshot can detect small wrist movements to refine a golf swing. Popular coaching platforms such as TrainingPeaks can use a new API to create a Custom Workout that can be imported directly into the Workout app. App developers using HealthKit for workouts will be able to provide validated calories for golf workouts, as the variation between using a golf cart or walking on the green is now identified. Developers can also access speed, cadence, and power metrics for cycling, plus mirror workouts from Apple Watch to iPhone. Availability The developer beta of watchOS 10 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com starting today. A public beta will be available to watchOS users next month at beta.apple.com . watchOS 10 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 4 or later paired with iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 17.

    "article_content": "Apple previewed iPadOS 17, delivering entirely new ways for users to personalise the Lock Screen and interact with widgets. Working with PDFs is easier with AutoFill, which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms, and Notes brings a new experience for marking up and collaborating on PDFs. Messages gets significant updates, including a new stickers experience, and users can now leave FaceTime video and audio messages. The Health app comes to iPad with interactive charts, and HealthKit enables developers to create innovative experiences designed for the iPad display. iPadOS 17 is available as a developer beta today, and will be available as a free software update this fall. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said, “iPadOS powers our most versatile device and enables users to do so many things on iPad, and now with iPadOS 17, we deliver an experience that’s even more personal and capable. With interactive widgets on the Lock Screen, updates to PDFs and Notes, as well as enhancements to Messages and FaceTime, iPadOS gives users even more ways to get things done easier and faster than ever.” A Personalised and Beautiful Lock Screen Experience Taking full advantage of the iPad display, users can now customise the Lock Screen to make it more personal, useful, and beautiful. Rich new photo features allow users to set their favourite images on the Lock Screen and stylise them in new ways. Users can select a photo from their personal library, a dynamic set of photos that shuffle throughout the day, or a Live Photo for a smooth slow-motion effect whenever they wake iPad. Users can choose a wallpaper from the Lock Screen gallery that will look stunning on the large canvas of iPad, pick from a set of expressive font styles and colours to customise the look of the date and time, or create unique designs with their favourite emoji and colour combinations. Live Activities comes to iPadOS, allowing users to stay on top of things that are happening in real time right from the Lock Screen, such as a sports game, travel plans, or a food delivery order. More Powerful Widgets Widgets get interactive in iPadOS 17, allowing users to get tasks done with just a tap. For example, users can turn on the lights, play a song, or mark a reminder as complete in the moment, right from a widget. And with updates to WidgetKit, developers can build interactivity into their widgets. Interactive widgets are now available on the Lock Screen and Home Screen, making it easy to take action and get helpful information at a glance. On the Lock Screen, widgets blend seamlessly with the wallpaper with adaptive tinting to optimise for legibility. Working with PDFs Is Even Easier Entering information in PDFs is now easier than ever. iPadOS 17 uses machine learning to identify fields in a PDF so that users can quickly add details, such as names, addresses, and emails from Contacts. Notes Introduces a New PDF Experience A big update to the Notes app gives users new ways to organise, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs. In iPadOS 17, PDFs appear full width, making it easy to flip through pages, make a quick annotation, or sketch directly in the document with Apple Pencil. Users can now review and mark up PDFs and scanned documents right in their note, and with live collaboration, updates appear in real time when users are sharing a note with others. Messages Gets More Interactive with Enhanced Communication Tools Messages offers new ways to connect, including a stickers experience with emoji stickers, and the ability for users to create Live Stickers from their own photos by lifting a subject from the background. Users can also add effects to Live Stickers that help bring conversations to life. Available from the keyboard, a new drawer gathers all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iPadOS. New Messages features include an expandable menu that appears with a simple tap for easy access to the user’s most frequently used iMessage apps. The search experience is improved with filters — including people, keywords, and content types — that allow more specificity in finding exactly what users are looking for. Users can now easily jump to their last-read message in an active group chat, and replying to a message inline is even simpler and quicker by swiping on a message bubble. Audio messages are transcribed automatically so users can read them in the moment or listen later. When a user shares their location in Messages, it shows up live in the conversation until the sharing session is over. More Expressive Ways to Communicate with FaceTime In FaceTime, users can leave an audio or video message when someone doesn’t pick up the call. FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions, such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video-calling apps can take advantage of them as well. In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPad and then hand it off to Apple TV to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room. Safari Helps Users Be More Productive Improvements to Safari allow users to be more productive than ever. With Profiles, users can keep their browsing separate between topics like work and personal. Each profile has their own history, cookies, Tab Groups, and Favourites, and it’s easy to switch between them. Private Browsing now allows users to lock the window they’re viewing with Face ID or Touch ID, and removes trackers used for cross-site tracking. The search experience gets even better with increased responsiveness, more relevant search suggestions, and easier-to-read suggestions. The Health App Comes to iPad iPadOS 17 brings the Health app to iPad, giving users new ways to see their health data in rich detail. With an optimised design for the iPad display, Favourites has a new look, and users can receive insights into their health data with Trends, Highlights, and detailed interactive charts. Now, iPad users can also track and manage their medications, use Cycle Tracking, log their momentary emotions and daily moods, view their available health records from multiple institutions, and more — all in one central, secure, and private place. Health and fitness developers can now use HealthKit on iPad, opening up new opportunities to create innovative experiences in their apps that incorporate data users choose to share, with rigorous privacy and data security protocols from the Health app. Additional iPadOS 17 updates include : Availability The developer beta of iPadOS 17 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com , and a public beta will be available to iPadOS users next month at beta.apple.com . New software features will be available this fall as a free software update for iPad (6th generation and later), iPad mini (5th generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later).

    "title": "Apple introduces the advanced new Apple Watch Series 9 - Technuter",

    "article_content": "Apple introduced Apple Watch Series 9, bringing new features to the world’s best-selling watch and achieving a significant environmental milestone. Apple Watch Series 9 is more powerful than ever with the new S9 SiP, which increases performance and capabilities; a magical new double tap gesture; a brighter display; faster on-device Siri, now with the ability to access and log health data; Precision Finding for iPhone; and more. Apple Watch Series 9 runs watchOS 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new watch faces, new cycling and hiking features, and tools to support mental health. For the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple’s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. The new Apple Watch lineup can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22. “Apple Watch is an indispensable companion that helps millions of people with their health, fitness, communications, and safety,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “We’re introducing our best Apple Watch lineup, with incredible new capabilities and technological advancements, including a new double tap gesture, brighter display, on-device Siri, as well as our first-ever carbon neutral products. Whether users are upgrading from earlier models or buying their first, there’s never been a more compelling time to experience Apple Watch.” “At Apple, we are committed to making products customers love and protecting the planet at the same time, and this year, we hit a key milestone toward our Apple 2030 goal,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our first carbon neutral products were made in a uniquely Apple way, steeply reducing carbon emissions from materials, electricity, and transportation through innovation and design.” Powerful New S9 SiP Apple Watch Series 9 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Series 9 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, when compared with Apple Watch Series 8. The power efficiency of the S9 SiP allows Apple Watch Series 9 to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life. 1 Double Tap Gesture Innovations such as the Digital Crown and Taptic Engine — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9. Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, and even to take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack. This new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Series 9, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month. Brighter Display The power-efficient S9 SiP and advanced display architecture increase the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display up to 2000 nits — double that of Series 8 — making it even easier to read text in bright sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by. On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate than Apple Watch Series 8. On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, or about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as their weight, period, or medications taken. 2 Precision Finding and HomePod Integration The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room. UWB also brings deeper integration between Apple Watch and HomePod. When an Apple Watch user gets within 4 meters of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media. Or if nothing is playing on HomePod, media suggestions will appear at the top of the Smart Stack. Featuring watchOS 10 Apple Watch Series 9 runs watchOS 10, a milestone update that includes: Carbon Neutral Models Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch SE are Apple’s first-ever carbon neutral products. As part of Apple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch packaging has been redesigned to be 100 percent fiber-based, and a new logo on the packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral. Apple Watch SE Apple Watch SE continues to deliver the core Apple Watch experience at a more affordable price point, and is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, use with Family Setup, or gift to their loved ones. Additionally, Apple Watch SE offers Activity tracking, high and low heart rate notifications, Fall Detection, Emergency SOS, Crash Detection, and watchOS 10. Lineup Bands Apple is introducing FineWoven, a luxurious and durable microtwill made of 68 percent post-consumer recycled content that has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather. FineWoven has a suedelike feel, and is available with the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle bands. Starting today, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple product, including watch bands. The popular Sport Loop band has been redesigned to include 82 percent recycled yarn. All new Apple Watch Sport Loops are carbon neutral. Apple worked with Nike and Hermès on more environmentally friendly band collections. The Nike Sport Band now contains 32 percent or more recycled fluoroelastomer, including colorful flakes made from excess bands that create a randomized pattern, making each band unique, while the Nike Sport Loop with a space-dye pattern repurposes yarn from previous seasons. A new collection of Hermès bands draws on the house’s rich history in textiles and craftsmanship. Two new woven bands are introduced: Toile H is an interpretation of the brand’s signature checked canvas, and Twill Jump is a rich solid color with contrasting details. The first-ever knitted band for Apple Watch, Bridon, is hand-braided with a bold chevron pattern, while Kilim is made of sporty, waterproof molded rubber and has a deployment buckle. A classic new watch face, Hermès Radial, complements these four new band styles. 3 Pricing and Availability Your email address will not be published.

A17 Pro unlocks next-level gaming experiences and pro performance. The new USB‑C connector is supercharged with USB 3 speeds — up to 20x faster than USB 2 — and together with new video formats, enables powerful pro workflows that were not possible before. And with the addition of Roadside Assistance via satellite, the iPhone 15 Pro lineup builds on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure to connect users to help if they have car trouble while off the grid. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be available in four stunning new finishes, including black titanium, white titanium, blue titanium, and natural titanium. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 15, with availability beginning Friday, September 22. “This is the most pro lineup we have ever created, with a state-of-the-art titanium design, the best iPhone camera system yet that enables game-changing new workflows, and the A17 Pro chip, which ushers in a new chapter of performance and games never before seen on iPhone,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max represent the best of Apple design and industry-first innovations to help enrich the everyday experiences of our users, while enabling them to unleash their creativity.” A Stunning, Lightweight, and Durable Design Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a strong and lightweight titanium design — a first for iPhone. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience. The all-new Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight; activating Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or using Shortcuts for more options. A press-and-hold gesture with fine-tuned haptic feedback and visual cues in the Dynamic Island ensure the new button launches the intended action. A17 Pro: A New Generation of Apple Silicon for iPhone Bringing pro performance and capabilities, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are powered by A17 Pro, the industry’s first 3-nanometer chip. Continuing Apple’s leadership in smartphone silicon, A17 Pro brings improvements to the entire chip, including the biggest GPU redesign in Apple’s history. The new CPU is up to 10 percent faster with microarchitectural and design improvements, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — iPhone 15 Pro offers smoother graphics, as well as more immersive AR applications and gaming experiences. iPhone 15 Pro brings true-to-life gaming to the palm of users’ hands with console titles never before seen on a smartphone, like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassin’s Creed Mirage. A17 Pro includes a dedicated AV1 decoder, enabling more efficient, high-quality video experiences for streaming services. Additionally, a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, now supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR. A Powerful Pro Camera System for More Creative Control Through a deep integration of hardware and software, the advanced camera systems on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max both pack the equivalent of seven pro lenses — all enabled by A17 Pro. With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the Main camera also supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. Great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple’s most advanced stabilization system yet. Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and better low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Additional features that benefit all cameras on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max include: The preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers gets even better with new pro workflows. Users can now get up to 20x faster transfer speeds with an optional USB 3 cable. iPhone and third-party solutions like Capture One also help photographers create a pro studio, allowing them to shoot and instantly transfer 48MP ProRAW images from iPhone to Mac. ProRes video can be recorded directly to external storage, enabling higher recording options up to 4K at 60 fps, and greater flexibility on set when using iPhone as the main camera. iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Color Encoding System, a global standard for color workflows. Coming later this year, iPhone 15 Pro will add a new dimension to video capture with the ability to record spatial video for Apple Vision Pro. Users will be able to capture precious moments in three dimensions and relive those memories with incredible depth on Apple Vision Pro when it is available early next year in the U.S. Next-Level Wireless Performance and Connectivity The iPhone 15 Pro lineup offers convenient new ways to charge, find friends in busy places, and stay connected while traveling. Both models use the USB‑C connector, a universally accepted standard for charging and transferring data, allowing the same cable to charge iPhone, Mac, iPad, and the updated AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Users can also charge AirPods or Apple Watch directly from iPhone with the USB‑C connector. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support USB 3 for data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, up to 20x faster than before. Both models feature the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, enabling two iPhone devices with this chip to connect at three times the range as before. This opens up a new way to use Precision Finding for Find My friends, so iPhone 15 users can share their location and find each other, even in crowds. Precision Finding is built with the same privacy protections that users have come to trust in Find My. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now support Wi-Fi 6E for greater wireless performance, including up to 2x faster speeds, and introduces the first Thread-enabled smartphones, opening up future opportunities for Home app integrations. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come equipped with super-fast 5G, and include: Expanded Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite. Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month. Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider. An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers. Featuring iOS 17 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature iOS 17, making iPhone even more personal and intuitive with new features: iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal, a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, improvements to autocorrect and Dictation that make entering text faster and easier than ever before, password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain, and much more. Better for the Environment iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025. To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

    "article_content": "Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become an everyday or, some might argue, an hourly problem. Using a variety of techniques, a wide range of threat actors from lone hackers, criminal gangs and hacktivists, to nation-states have and are using DDoS attacks. These attacks are carried out to degrade or disable the performance and network communications of target systems. These targets can be small or large businesses, internet service providers, manufacturers, retailers, healthcare providers, schools and universities, or other nation-states. Essentially, any entity with an online presence can become a DDoS target. Now, here is the why. There are three main reasons why people create botnets: For financial gain by extortion—pay up or we keep attacking; to make a point—stop (or start) doing something or we continue; or, in the case of nation-state actors, as an espionage or cyber warfare tactic. In our previous blog post we covered the history of DDoS attacks and our A10 Networks DDoS Threat Report, which reviewed the techniques used in DDoS attacks. In this article we’re going to cover the how of botnet and DDoS attacks, the most common mechanism for delivering attacks using collections of remotely controlled, compromised services or devices. What is a Botnet? The bots of a botnet can include computers, smartphones, virtualized machines, and/or a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras, smart TVs, routers, anything that has internet connectivity and can be compromised. In particular, IoT vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are extremely common in the consumer market making it very easy for hackers to create an IoT botnet. Moreover, botnets, particularly when they become part of an IoT botnet, can be enormous; a single botnet can be comprised of hundreds of thousands or even millions of hijacked devices. Hijacking devices for a botnet involves finding devices that have security vulnerabilities to make it possible to be infected with “botware,” malware to be installed on the device. But the devices infected with botware aren’t the only thing a botnet needs. Many sources—including as of writing Wikipedia—appear to be confused about what constitutes a botnet. While the most obvious part of a botnet is the collection of devices it includes, the defining component is the existence of a command and control (C&C) system that controls what the network of bots does. The botware on each compromised device communicates with the botnet command and control system and becomes part of a network of bots. Driven by commands from a “botmaster” or “botherder”—the person or group controlling the bots—some or all of the devices in the botnet do whatever they are asked to do. Botnet Command and Control The early communications between botnet command and control systems and botware on compromised devices were based on the client-server model using, for example, Internet Relay Chat (IRC). The botware connected to an IRC channel and waited for commands. Each bot can also respond on the same channel with status updates or remotely acquired data. Alternatives to IRC include the use of Telnet connections and HTTP requests for webpages or custom services. It’s worth noting that some botnets have used a hierarchical C&C system where layers of bots communicate in a client-server fashion with the bots in the layer above and relay commands to the layer below them. The latest botnet command and control communications for botnets are based on peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. In this model, compromised devices discover each other by scanning IP address ranges to find specific port and protocol services and, when another botnet member is identified, sharing lists of known peers and relayed commands. This type of highly distributed mesh networking is obviously more complicated to create but also much harder to disrupt. The Rise of the IoT Botnet IoT devices include a huge range of commercial and consumer devices such as temperature measurement systems, smart TVs, IP cameras, smart door bells, security systems, network routers and switches, and even children’s toys. Despite a huge amount of commentary and warnings about IoT vulnerabilities and well-understood fixes to improve their security, basic defenses such as requiring effective passwords and not allowing default logins and user accounts are still ignored. Another source of IoT vulnerabilities comes from vendors not providing updates to address security problems and or the device owners failing to apply updates. What Do Botnets Do? Botnets are used for four main purposes and, generally, a botnet can be switched as a whole or in parts between any of these functions. Spam and Phishing One of the earliest uses of botnets was for generating spam, unsolicited commercial or fraudulent email. By using bots for this purpose, spammers avoid the problem of getting their bulk sending IP addresses blacklisted and even if some bots get blacklisted, there’ll always be more bots to use. A more targeted use of botnet spam is for phishing for identity theft. By generating huge amounts of spam email messages inviting recipients to visit promotional websites, websites that appear to be banks or other financial institutions, enter competitions, etc., scammers try to harvest personal information such as bank account details, credit card data, and website logins. Pay-per-Click Fraud To increase website ad revenues—advertising networks such as Google pay-per-click on adverts the websites serve—botnets are used to fake user interaction. Because of the distributed nature of the sources of the clicks, it’s hard for the ad networks to identify click fraud. Cryptomining By running the algorithms that mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether on tens of thousands of bots—an IoT botnet is the perfect platform. It thereby steals computer power from the device’s owner, and allows significant revenue without the usual costs of mining, mostly importantly, the cost of electricity. DDoS Attacks as a Service Distributed Denial of Service attacks are easily launched using botnets and, as with botnet generated spam, the distributed nature of the bots makes it difficult to filter out DDoS traffic. Botnets can execute any kind of DDoS attack and even launch multiple attack types simultaneously. A relatively new hacker business is DDoS-as-a-Service. On the Dark Web and now, even on the regular web, you can buy DDoS attacks for as little as $5 per hour; the pricing depends on the required scale and duration of the attack. A Very Brief History of Botnets Arguably, the first true internet botnet was Bagle, first discovered in 2004. Bagle was a Windows worm that relayed spam sent from a botmaster. While the first version, called Bagle.A, was of limited success, the second version, Bagle.B infected something like 230,000 computers. On New Year’s Day 2010, the malware was responsible for roughly 14 percent of all spam. By April 2010, Bagle was sending approximately 5.7 billion spam messages per day. As with most malware, other hackers copied and improved the code with over 100 variants found in the wild by 2005. Since then, arguably the first botnet to launch a DDoS attack was Akbot in 2007. The Akbot botnet was created by an 18-year-old in New Zealand. It used a C&C system based on IRC and at its peak involved 1.3 million computers. Over time, botnet attacks have become commonplace and the biggest botnet known to date, the Russian BredoLab botnet, consisted of 30,000,000 devices. The Future of Botnet and DDoS Attacks Botnets are here to stay. Given the exponential growth of poorly secured IoT devices that can be co-opted into an IoT botnet as well as the growing population of vulnerable computers, botnet attacks have become endemic. As a cyber warfare tool, botnet and DDoS attacks have been observed on both sides of the Russian operation against Ukraine. Whether you’re a government organization or a private company, you should be planning how you’re going to deal with a botnet and DDoS attack. Your first step is to realize that no online property or service is too big or too small to be attacked. Second, plan for increased bandwidth ideally on an as needed basis. The ability to scale up your internet connection will make it harder for a botnet and DDoS attack to saturate your access and cut you off from the internet. The same elastic provisioning strategy applies to using cloud services rather relying than on-prem or single data center services. Next, consider using or expanding your use of a content delivery network to increase your client-side delivery bandwidth. Using multiple CDNs also increases your resistance to DDoS attacks. Finally, harden everything. Strategically deploying hardware and software DDoS mitigation services throughout your infrastructure is key to making botnet and DDoS attacks have minimal impact.

    "article_content": "From delivering customer support to special offers after customers have browsed certain products, businesses rely on personalized digital experiences. While customers appreciate thoughtful personalization, however, many are uncomfortable with the sense of being spied on. Marketers face their own challenges when balancing engaging personalization and privacy, not least from regulators. For those operating globally, to comply with new and constantly evolving guidelines means investing in different platforms and regimes across multiple jurisdictions. As consumers grow more aware of data privacy, their peace of mind is essential to companies unlocking the benefits of personalization. Having the right software is key to ensuring that data is managed properly, boosting marketer and developer productivity, and availing of opportunities to build better customer relationships. Striking the right balance between personalization and privacy According to Salesforce’s 2022 State of the Connected Customer Report, 52% of customers expect offers to always be personalized. Yet 74% of consumers feel companies collect more personal information than they need and 64% feel companies aren’t as transparent as they should be when it comes to personal data use. Personalization and privacy don’t have to be at odds. Leaning into ethical data tools and services can be an essential design principle for ensuring digital experiences are built to enhance trust. There are four key ways that companies can unlock value and savings by implementing ethical personalization. Create consumer-facing data policies and practices, and communicate these in simple, understandable language. For brand and operational consistency, companies should also implement these policies at all levels – not just in training or guidance but in the software. By embedding ethical use into data collection, use, retention, and expiration processes, everyone across the organization can focus on differentiated and ethical customer engagement. Decrease the data “productivity tax” to free up marketers’ time. It’s estimated that marketers are losing between 8% and 12% of their overall production time to inefficient data management. By carefully designing the way data are collected, retained, and used, businesses can cut this productivity tax and free up teams’ time to deliver personalized experiences instead. Keep more first-party data. Having a complete view of the customer enables organizations to tailor communications to their specific needs and interests which will drive incremental sales and margins. Yet, on average, companies lose 8% of their first-party data due to time spent cleaning, preparing, and managing. By improving tools and communication with customers about data collection, organizations can avoid throwing away this valuable information. Maximizing Value for Businesses and Consumers Consumers are more likely to do business with companies they trust. Data can be incredibly valuable for improving the customer experience, but it must be used ethically and responsibly. The more transparent they are about their personalization strategy, the easier it will be for customers to understand what data they should provide and how it will be used. By building safeguards and protections into products and practices, partnering with engineering and product teams to consider the privacy implications, and working closely with customers to explore thoughtful data collection, companies can deliver remarkable experiences for their consumers while deepening trust. With the right mindset, partners, and technology, privacy and personalization can work hand-in-hand.

    "article_content": "AI and data analytics are becoming increasingly important in today’s business landscape. The global AI market is projected to reach $190 billion by 2025, and the data analytics industry is expected to become a $77 billion industry by 2023. Businesses must adopt and employ data mining, machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing to explore how they can solve problems and improve operations, and user experience, and stay competitive in manufacturing, healthcare, finance, logistics, and retail industries. While there are many valuable facets of AI, such as RPA, computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, video analytics, forecasting, predictions, insights, and robotics, businesses must also navigate the risks and challenges of improper use of these technologies. AI systems that are biased or programmed incorrectly can discriminate against individuals or groups, and the use of AI in safety-critical systems can result in accidents and injuries. To mitigate these risks, businesses must adhere to the core ethics of AI, such as fairness and bias, trust and transparency, accountability, social benefit, and privacy and security. Openness to modification, model drift, governance, scalability, and transparency are some of the major challenges with AI. However, trends like machine learning, increased automation, conversational AI, and AI for social good will advance the field in the future. Industry leaders, such as Mr. Deepak Goel, Customer Success Leader at Prolifics stress the importance of properly evaluating and understanding how to best use AI. He suggests that companies must infuse AI into customer interactions, offices, and the workforce to effectively operationalize it, leveraging the benefits of cutting-edge technology while minimizing risk factors. Microsoft’s incident with its AI chatbot named Tay in 2016 serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of AI and the need for better safeguards against inappropriate use. Microsoft recommended enhanced filtering, more human oversight, openness, accountability, and education to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. They acknowledged the need for educating users about AI systems, as well as the necessity for increased human intervention and better moderation to prevent dangerous conduct. Their response demonstrated a dedication to risk mitigation, ethical use, and responsible AI development. Even for that matter, Amazon’s AI recruiting tool turned out to be a blunder when it discriminately shortlisted only male resumes over female. After this embarrassing incident, Amazon immediately stopped using it and found out that the tool was biased due to the data used to train it, which favored male candidates over female candidates. To address this, Amazon updated its training data, audited other AI systems, provided additional employee training, and developed new tools and processes to evaluate job candidates. They emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring and testing to prevent bias and discrimination in their AI systems. It is essential for end-users to understand how AI and data analytics work, so they can make informed decisions while minimizing the associated risks and challenges. They must also be aware of the potential biases that can be present in AI systems and how these biases can impact decision-making. In conclusion, AI and data analytics have tremendous potential, but businesses must approach these technologies with caution and awareness of the risks involved. As Deepak Goel puts it, “Companies must carefully evaluate AI’s impact and how best to use it, so they can leverage its benefits while minimizing the risks.” Authored by:- Mr. Deepak Goel, Customer Success Leader at Prolifics (The views expressed in this article are by – Mr. Deepak Goel, Customer Success Leader at Prolifics.

    "article_content": "The education sector has been severely affected by the pandemic, and students preparing for competitive exams such as the UPSC Civil Services Exam (CSE) have been hit the hardest. These students are used to physical classroom teaching and depend heavily on coaching institutes for IAS preparation . However, the lockdown restrictions imposed to fight COVID-19 have limited their options for quality guidance. Rau’s IAS Study Circle has adapted to online teaching methodology to ensure that its students’ IAS exam preparations are not hampered by the restrictions. Rau’s IAS Interactive-Online classes are designed to replicate the offline experience, allowing teachers to teach in the same manner as they would in a physical classroom. The interaction between students and teachers is multiparty, enabling students to ask questions and clarify doubts while also benefiting from peer learning. To ensure that its students receive quality guidance, Rau’s IAS has created an E-learn platform that provides access to frequent homework, regular class tests, and opportunities for doubt solving and discussion. The platform also includes video backups of live-online classes, as well as access to additional teaching and testing resources. Interactive-Online classes for IAS exam Rau’s IAS Interactive-Online classes enable teachers to teach in exactly the same manner as they used to teach in the classrooms in offline mode. Interaction between students and teachers is the same as an offline class since students are able to ask and clarify doubts from the teacher. Also, this interaction between students and teacher is multiparty i.e. all the students can see each other and listen to others’ doubts thereby making learning more participative. The multiparty interaction enables teachers to read the online class (are students confused, should more examples be used to clear concepts, etc.) and customize the delivery of their content to suit the online classroom dynamic. Also, the multiparty nature of the classes, makes students feel the positive side of peer-pressure propelling them to stay focused; and that eventually leads to improved learning. Rau’s IAS Study Circle is the first IAS coaching academy which has pioneered in teaching through interactive-online classes. For Rau’s IAS, just organizing information for delivery isn’t teaching but teaching is all that can be done to ensure that the students learn the concepts and acquire skills to use those under practical settings (UPSC Prelims exam and UPSC Mains exam). To replicate the offline experience, Rau’s IAS has created its E-learn platform to offer everything that has been part of the physical classroom experience. Rau’s IAS online learning platform (elearn.rauias.com) enables: Quality guidance is now available to everyone at the touch of a button We understand, that UPSC aspirants come from all walks of lives, from different background and therefore their approach to studies is different. Rau’s IAS Online courses for UPSC exam provide a unique avenue for IAS aspirants to juggle the demands of their daily lives on their scarce time and other resources, while still being able to prepare for and crack IAS exam. Generally speaking, for working professionals, parents, international students, students with disabilities and students located in far flung areas, an IAS course delivered online by Rau’s IAS (experts in the field of UPSC Civil Services coaching) can be hugely beneficial. Also, during these pandemic conditions, all students who wish to socially distance themselves and study from the safety of their home, can also take advantage of Rau’s IAS online courses. The future of Online IAS coaching One must understand that education requires “high-quality guidance” from teachers. Technology is ‘‘just’’ a medium. High quality guidance can be delivered by teachers effectively online as well if they are trained to use technology appropriately. We have trained our teachers to use instructional technology to teach and resolve doubts. Our teachers are proficient to use technology to enhance student learning outcomes through active student engagement, collaborative learning and frequent feedback to evaluate teaching absorption. Rau’s IAS has integrated technology in its instruction and curriculum. Rau’s IAS online classes make students feel like they are in the classroom. There is no denying the fact that students have to depend on online teaching for the time being as that is the only available medium of learning, but we feel that online teaching will be a practical solution for many, even after the pandemic. From student’s feedback regarding the efficacy of online classes and online learning experience as a whole, it is evident that Rau’s IAS Online course has emerged as an effective and reliable solution for preparing for UPSC exam.

    "article_content": "Cloud services are critical in fostering innovation, improving business efficiency, and making it easier for businesses to scale up their operations in the digital era, especially with today’s accelerating AI adoption. A significant number of business leaders and decision-makers recognise the cloud as critical to driving forward the digital transformation initiatives of the businesses they control. However, they are frequently put off by the high costs and complexities involved in putting a resilient multi-cloud strategy into practice. Many technology experts and solution providers advise businesses to adopt multiple cloud providers in order to improve efficiency, increase flexibility, and generate new opportunities. However, this approach often entails managing multiple contracts, engaging in multiple negotiations and transactions, possessing technical knowledge, and making significant investments. Reach 90% of the Indian cloud market simply, through a Single Access Port DirectCLOUD, a cutting-edge interconnection solution, has transformed the way businesses connect to cloud providers by eliminating the need for multiple third-party vendors and in-house technical expertise. DirectCLOUD eliminates the need for costly on-premise infrastructure, resulting in lower administration and overhead costs. With this unique solution, users can directly access known cloud platforms such as Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud via a single access port. This cutting-edge service enables seamless connectivity and covers ≥ 90% of the Indian cloud market without the need for any additional infrastructural upgrades. This simplicity allows for a greater emphasis on essential abilities and more efficient resource allocation when using DirectCLOUD’s infrastructure to access cloud data storage, processing, and computing resources. Better performance and security of cloud connectivity DirectCLOUD users benefit from avoiding public Internet, which results in fewer network hops between the origin and the destination. Controlling the data pathway in this way not only reduces the latency and improves the performance of the connection, but also improves data sovereignty and security. Businesses of all sizes, from startups to Fortune 500 companies, use DirectCLOUD because of its many advantages. For telecommunications companies (Telcos), data centers, and internet service providers (ISPs) that serve these businesses, this represents an opportunity for additional revenue and value-adding to portfolios. Due to the service’s white-labelling capabilities, ISPs, Telcos, and Data Centers can increase their revenue by reselling DirectCLOUD under their own name. This means that they can benefit from a plethora of revenue streams, all thanks to their Single Access Port. DirectCLOUD has been instrumental in enabling Indian consumers to make informed decisions when selecting data centers. DirectCLOUD has become a deciding factor for users in their data center selection process by emphasizing the importance of cloud connectivity. Two case studies below illustrate the benefits of the service: Case Study 1 A well-known consumer optics company in Bangalore that relies on Amazon Web Services but is slowed to a crawl by 330 milliseconds of latency whenever it tries to access AWS at Singapore via the public internet. Their latency after migrating to DE-CIX India’s DirectCLOUD dropped to 40ms. They have not reported any trouble ticket in the past two years and are now enjoying seamless and error-free connectivity. Case Study 2 Since DE-CIX India’s DirectCLOUD solution can be “white-labeled,” one of the country’s largest telecom companies is reselling it under its own brand name. As a result of our service, they’ve established themselves as a go-to vendor, facilitating digital transformation for hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses and large corporations, as well as one of our Largest Data Centre Providers, which incorporated these services into their service offering. This demonstrates both the service’s remarkable adaptability and the provider’s ability to profit financially from their Single Access Port in a variety of ways. Guaranteed performance levels give customers extra confidence DE-CIX has a deeply rooted commitment to supporting small and medium businesses (SMBs), small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and large enterprises with their digital transformation. This commitment is mirrored in the DirectCLOUD service as well. Not only are the connections offered cost-effective, but they also have increased strength, resilience, redundancy, reliability, and security. DE-CIX India goes above and beyond to ensure that DirectCLOUD customers receive a predetermined level of performance, availability, and reliability. This is achieved by implementing guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). By establishing these SLAs, DE-CIX India offers customers, confidence in the consistent quality and dependability of the services they receive. Accelerate digital transformation for direct connectivity to the cloud To summarise, DE-CIX’s DirectCLOUD provides simple and cost-effective cloud access for businesses looking to leverage the power of the cloud. In today’s competitive market, its direct connection, flexibility, and dependability enable organisations to accelerate digital transformation, improve flexibility, and stay ahead of the competition. To fully realise the benefits of cloud computing for any company, businesses are switching to DirectCLOUD. Access to multiple cloud providers is simpler than ever before with DE-CIX India’s DirectCLOUD.

    "article_content": "The transportation of data is a complicated task in the digital era. Business professionals will look to move data regularly as they work. However, information resides in a multitude of data centers, cloud services and edge locations – and moving data can be a complicated and expensive task. Digital leaders must lay the groundwork to ensure data is accessible in the future. They should think carefully about how to store data. They should focus on tagging data and should concentrate on storage management and protection. That way, digital leaders can be sure data is collected, backed up and accessed by the right people. Dell Technologies Global Data Protection Index Report 2022 stated that 86% of businesses had experienced a cybersecurity incident led disruption. The report also captured that businesses would be experiencing more frequent cyber-attacks or incidents this year. To create a more cyber-resilient approach to data protection, businesses need to modernize and automate their recovery and business continuity strategies and leverage the latest intelligent tools to detect and defend against cyber threats. The current challenges in security can be mitigated through a robust Cyber Resiliency strategy. Cyber resilience requires a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. In addition to advanced threat protection and security training for employees, a strong cyber recovery strategy can promote cyber resilience by protecting backup systems from corruption and enabling fast recovery of business-critical systems, applications, and operations after an attack. In short, Cyber Resiliency is a strategy that incorporates people, processes, and technology into a holistic framework that protects an entire business, organization, or entity. This strategy allows businesses to prepare for and recover rapidly from disruptions caused by cyberattacks. Automated Data Vaults Cyber resilience cannot be achieved without a major component – the Cyber Recovery Vault. It offers multiple layers of protection to provide resilience against cyberattacks even from an insider threat. It moves critical data away from the attack surface, physically isolating it within a protected part of the data center, and requires separate security credentials and multifactor authentication for access. Additional safeguards include an automated operational air gap to provide network isolation and eliminate management interfaces that could be compromised. If a ransomware or data destruction attack impacts data and applications in the main production environments, the threat actors still cannot access the contents of the data vault. Post-attack, as part of the incident response and recovery process, clean copies of data and applications stored in the data vault are used to restore the production environment. If a cyberattack occurs, we can quickly identify a clean copy of our data, recover our critical systems and get our business back up and running. Data Isolation and Governance Similarly, ensuring an isolated data center environment that is disconnected from corporate and backup networks and restricted from users other than those with proper clearance is another method for ensuring a water-tight cyber recovery strategy. By isolating critical data, identifying suspicious activity, and accelerating data recovery, enterprises can more easily achieve cyber resilience with this approach. Intelligent Analytics and Tools Additionally, machine learning and full-content indexing with powerful analytics within the safety of the vault are effective tools for detecting threats. This also includes automated integrity checks to determine whether data has been impacted by malware and tools to support remediation if needed. Recovery and Remediation If an incident has indeed taken place, remediation consists of workflows and tools that perform recovery by using dynamic restore processes and existing data recovery procedures to bring business-critical systems back online quickly and with confidence. This must also include a comprehensive methodology for protecting data, as well as performing damage assessments and forensics to provide an organization with the confident and most reliable path to recovery of business-critical systems. Solution Planning and Design Finally, expert guidance and services can help organizations determine which business-critical systems need protection and can create dependency maps for associated applications and services, as well as the infrastructure needed to recover them. For example, Zero Trust is a cybersecurity model that shifts how organizations approach security from relying solely on perimeter defenses to a proactive strategy that only allows known good activity across ecosystems and data pipelines. It allows organizations to better align their cybersecurity strategy across the data center, clouds, and at the edge. Such services also generate recovery requirements and design alternatives, while identifying the technologies to analyze, host and protect data, along with a business case and implementation timeline. Executives dealing with data must be pragmatic. Organizations and their employees will continue to use a range of platforms for security. Rather than assuming data is consolidated and constrained, businesses need to create a cyber resilience strategy that addresses a broad range of threats and barriers. Only then will data be fully utilized as the valuable resource it can and should be.

It is apt to state that the market is responding to moving customer behaviour by offering more individualised, immersive, and sustainable content. Evolution Phase In the initial phase, television became integral to audio-visual development, revolutionizing how people consumed media and allowing them to watch their favourite programs in their homes. However, this drift widened with the trend and consumer needs, and the use of VCRs and DVDs sparked the industry. Television still plays a crucial part in home entertainment, and with time and advancements, the product is evolving faster. New Audio-visual technology inclined with consumer behaviour Advanced Projectors – Projectors have come a long way since their inception, transforming the bulky design to a sleek and portable size with advanced, user-friendly features. Technological advancements and changing consumer preferences have shaped the evolution of projectors. The lamp-based projectors have been replaced with laser projectors giving longer lifespans and improved color accuracy. Similarly, LED technology is now embedded in the projectors offering high brightness, clear images, energy efficiency, minimal maintenance and sustainability to the ecosystem. Portable projectors are also becoming a new trend giving consumers a free hand to experience their favourite shows, movies or programs at their convenience. In recent time, projectors are widely being used in Edtech interactive whiteboards. These whiteboards allow teachers to display digital content, such as videos and images, on a large screen. Students can then interact with the content using tools available in the whiteboards, making the learning experience more engaging and interactive. The evolution of projectors has provided consumers with extensive, precise, and more immersive visual experiences, transforming how content is viewed and enjoyed. Rise of virtual and augmented reality The use of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) has significantly increased in the audio-visual sector. Users of VR are entirely engrossed in a simulated environment, giving them an engaging and sensory experience. It is widely being used in education, corporates, entrainment and gaming. Consumer expectations for dynamic and engaging content have changed due to both VR and AR. As technology develops, VR/AR is positioned to be a significant force in the future of the audio-visual sector, providing fascinating and transforming experiences. Sustainable approach The environmental impact of audio-visual technology has become a growing concern for consumers. Today, industry players are developing eco-friendly technologies; for instance, the use of LED technologies in projectors and video displays and the consumption of content online has reduced physical media usage, resulting in decreased waste and energy consumption. Furthermore, consumers prioritize energy-efficient devices such as smart TVs, projectors and streaming devices to reduce their carbon footprint. From the introduction of television to the rise of VR and AR technology, each development has been influenced by how people consume media. As technology advances, it will be interesting to see how consumer behaviour will continue to shape the evolution of audio-visual technology.

    "article_content": "In the era of digital transactions, credit card fraud has emerged as a pervasive financial crime. This nefarious activity involves the unauthorized use of credit card information, either through stealing existing details or creating new accounts. Understanding the various avenues through which credit card fraud occurs is crucial for individuals to protect themselves in this digital age. Credit card fraud can manifest in several forms, each exploiting different vulnerabilities. Online shopping scams, phishing schemes, card skimmers, data breaches, and even simple theft are among the tactics employed by fraudsters to gain access to sensitive credit card information. As technology evolves, so do the methods employed by criminals, making it imperative for consumers to stay informed about potential threats. How to prevent credit card fraud? To combat credit card fraud effectively, individuals must adopt proactive measures to safeguard their financial information. Maintaining the security of credit card details, monitoring transactions, using secure online platforms, and being vigilant against phishing and skimming scams are key strategies in preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, leveraging advanced security measures provided by credit card issuers, such as two-factor authentication and virtual credit card numbers, can add an extra layer of protection. How to report credit card fraud? In the event of suspected credit card fraud, individuals must act swiftly to mitigate potential damage. The first step involves promptly contacting the credit card issuer to report the suspected fraud and request the freezing of the affected account. Simultaneously, individuals should place a fraud alert with one of the major credit bureaus to enhance security measures and minimize the risk of further unauthorized activities. Additionally, filing a complaint with relevant law enforcement agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the local district attorney becomes essential, depending on the nature of the fraud. Regular monitoring of credit reports is advised to promptly identify any unauthorized account openings, providing an early warning system against potentially fraudulent activities. To fortify online security, it is crucial to update passwords and security settings for compromised online accounts. For an added layer of protection, individuals may consider implementing a credit freeze, which prevents unauthorized access to credit reports and can be unfrozen when necessary for legitimate transactions. By following these comprehensive steps, individuals can actively engage in the prevention and resolution of credit card fraud, safeguarding their financial well-being. Understanding the common types of credit card fraud and adopting proactive measures is crucial in safeguarding personal and financial information. In an age where digital transactions are ubiquitous, credit card fraud continues to evolve, making vigilance and preventive measures essential for protecting oneself and one’s finances. By staying informed and implementing the outlined strategies, individuals can fortify their defences against the ever-present threat of credit card fraud. Authored by:- Mr. Dhiren .V.

    "article_content": "Oracle announced new AI innovations in the latest release of the Oracle APEX low-code development platform. The new APEX AI Assistant simplifies application development and helps developers quickly build feature-rich, mission-critical applications at scale. Developers now can create applications by using natural language prompts to specify desired capabilities and components and automatically generate SQL statements, perform one-click debug correction, eliminate the need to remember table names, and easily add an out-of-the-box conversational interface to their applications. Oracle APEX is a fully supported, no-cost feature of Oracle Database and all Oracle Database services including Oracle Autonomous Database that developers can try for free here. By replacing complex traditional coding, Oracle APEX’s declarative development approach enables developers to build and deploy mission-critical enterprise applications 20X faster with 100X less code. With over 21 million applications built, Oracle APEX is the platform of choice for over 850,000 developers in organizations across industries worldwide. “As a developer and someone who writes SQL every day, I know how challenging it can be to remember table names, column names, and syntax I don’t frequently use. Having an AI assistant to determine column names contextually, JOINS, and generate complex syntax is a real game changer,” said Mike Hichwa, senior vice president, software development, Oracle. “Best of all, I can use plain natural language, such as ‘show me all pink T-shirts in size large left over from the most recent shipments to our Kansas City and Wichita locations’ and the APEX AI Assistant will automate that for me, and show me the precise results.” Oracle APEX is included in Oracle Database and all Oracle Database services including Oracle Autonomous Database, delivering extreme application performance, as well as industry-hardened security, availability, and scalability. For example, when used in conjunction with AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai, Oracle APEX offers a way for developers to combine semantic search for documents, images, and other unstructured data with searches on private business data. New AI enhancements in Oracle APEX include: APEX AI Assistant: Enables the creation of valid SQL statements from a natural language user prompt. APEX AI Assistant remembers SQL syntax, so developers don’t have to and automates the writing of SQL queries. It explains existing code and suggests code bug fixes that can be adopted with a simple click, freeing developers from routine coding tasks. Create App Assistant: Enables the creation of new application blueprints from a natural language user prompt that specifies desired attributes and capabilities. This simplifies the development of new applications and allows developers to focus their energy and resources on creating unique, bespoke application features rather than underlying code. Conversational AI dialogs: Enables end-users to “converse” with their applications in natural language through an out-of-the-box conversational interface that developers can easily add to their applications. As a result, developers can provide a richer in-app experience without the need to build generative AI or natural language processing components from scratch. The new version of Oracle APEX is available to use today and will be demonstrated at the APEX Conference at ODTUG Kscope24 from July 14 – 18 in Nashville, TN.

NuRe Bharat Network aims to connect all urban, semi-urban, and rural regions, further connecting India and Bharat to the digital medium by offering free captive WiFi solutions across the Indian Railway network. NuRe Bharat Network will completely change the dynamics of reaching through to the world’s second-largest digital consumer in a simplified manner. The launch comes at the back of a recent announcement made by the company for bagging a 5-year WiFi monetization deal from RailTel, with Rs 1000 crore revenue potential. At the virtual launch, 3i Infotech also revealed the interface and functioning of the captive portal and mobile app that will help the advertisers leverage their services to connect with the 1.8 million users per day across 6,108+ railway networks in the country by providing free WiFi service to the users. Speaking on the momentous occasion, Mr Sax Krishna, Head of NuRe Bharat Network said, “We are excited to be a part of such an impactful partnership with RailTel as it gives us a platform to service India & Bharat through the means of providing socially applicable and commercially viable products and services. The captive portal and application will open the space for advertisers to connect with the growing India, primarily rural Bharat demographics, thereby utilizing a huge untapped opportunity. The partnership model will also be a major proof point for us to exhibit and demonstrate our capabilities across the Edge ecosystem including Edge Space, Computing and Analytics through the combination and convergence of edge with the WiFi network, we will be able to deploy our fundamental design with the engines of growth in a much better way that we have put together in the form of a company.” At the launch of NuRe Bharat Network, Mr Manoj Tandon, Director of Project, Operations and Maintenance, RailTel Corporation of India Limited (RCIL) shared his happiness and wished all success to the new Joint Venture formed for the WiFi monetisation project. Ramu Bodathula, Head of Technology, NuRe Bharat Network presented the technology stack walk-through of the application and expressed, “We want to go beyond the captive portal and hence, we will soon be launching the mobile app, which will provide beyond `Free Internet’. It will also allow the advertisers to provide travel, infotainment, education, and e-commerce-based services.” The WiFi captive portal will allow a user to access free WiFi for the first thirty minutes at railway stations across India, after which, the user may or may not extend the free service by watching advertisements. Then, the portal will switch to the paid medium. To access free WiFi, users need to connect to the WiFi network and provide login credentials. This platform will be available in multiple Indian languages apart from English. The platform will unlock opportunities for advertisers to reach out to the digital consumer via smart advertising solutions and data insights. Thus, the NuRe Bharat Network will be a pivotal contributor in the digital and e-commerce sector, poised to cross US$350 billion by 2030 and become a key advertising platform for larger national brands, upcoming MSMEs and local businesses.

Avi Chawla, a data scientist and community manager at AIport, put it: “The penetration of GenAI in India is a complex and multifaceted issue. Despite being home to a large startup ecosystem, India has yet to make a substantial impact in the AI arena compared to global leaders. However, Indian entrepreneurs are increasingly capitalizing on GenAI enthusiasm, with numerous startups in the sector. Companies like Gan, TrueFoundry, Ola’s Krutrim (an Indian version of ChatGPT), and Cube are examples of startups leading the GenAI space in India. The interest in GenAI has encouraged almost all venture funds in India to develop investment strategies for this emerging space.” A North America Overview AIport’s findings underline North America’s dominance in GenAI, with 39 companies leading in terms of the number of models produced and their diversity. North American companies are pioneering in multimodal models and have the highest number of companies releasing multiple GenAI models. Europe’s Contribution Europe’s diverse GenAI landscape is highlighted by contributions from 18 countries, with the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Austria, and Russia at the forefront. European companies excel in business intelligence and text-related GenAI solutions, though they trail behind North America in multimodal models. Asia’s Emerging Role Asia, led by India, China, Israel, Singapore, and Japan, is rapidly catching up in GenAI innovation. While Asia’s GenAI landscape may currently seem less prominent compared to North America and Europe, it shows immense potential for future growth, driven by economic efficiency and a rich talent pool. India is presented in the landscape with generative models by gnani.ai, Tymely, Dubverse, and APPQUIPO as regional leaders. The landscape also identifies significant strides in GenAI development in less-represented regions like Oceania, South America, and Africa, underscoring their potential for growth and innovation in AI. The industry picture AIport’s comprehensive research methodology encompassed all 62 countries in the Global AI Index, identifying key players and categorizing them into 10 GenAI solution categories. This approach ensures a balanced and thorough representation of global GenAI development. Generative AI is poised to be the most transformative technology wave yet, replicating human capabilities with unprecedented efficiency. AIport’s global landscape is just the beginning, marking a new era in understanding and appreciating the diverse contributions to GenAI across the world. Avi Chawla added, “In summary, while India is yet to establish a significant global presence in the GenAI field compared to some of its international counterparts, the country is making notable progress. This includes rapid growth in the number of GenAI startups, significant investments from major companies, and an overarching recognition of GenAI’s potential impact on the economy and various industries. What’s more, due to wide cultural diversity, the Indian government is also actively investing in GenAI developments for more inclusivity, which is also evident from its recent launch of Anuvaad Bhashini, a tool that helps Indian citizens translate content into different Indian languages.” Your email address will not be published.

Features like birthday reminders are also included to enhance customer delight.

Multiple Bank Accounts: Users can now manage multiple bank accounts and payment modes, making it easier to reconcile payments received and made from different accounts. Data Export to Tally: Users can seamlessly export all myBillBook data to Tally, a popular accounting software, making it easier to manage their business data and reports. “Understanding the use cases and solving the pain points of our users through technology-led solutions is core to our philosophy.

    "article_content": "As India prepares to celebrate Diwali, businesses have a great opportunity to connect with customers during this festival season. For many businesses, this means using WhatsApp to engage with customers in a convenient and reliable way on the app they’re already using throughout the day. In fact, 8 out of 10 people in India say that messaging is their preferred way of communicating with a business. To keep businesses on track and to engage better with their customers, here are three WhatsApp strategies that businesses can continue doing to drive more sales. 1. Create a great messaging experience for customers For many small business owners in India, WhatsApp is their business – their website or virtual store counter to showcase products, answer customer queries and drive sales. So when customers come, you need to be ready. During Diwali, that might be as simple as updating your business hours in your business profile in the WhatsApp Business app to let people know you’re open during the celebration – especially if your operating hours will be different than usual – or even putting up an away message to inform customers when you’re available or when you might be enjoying the festivities. And if you have any special items or deals and promotions, it’s best to highlight that in your catalog so people can easily find what they might want to buy. For larger businesses using the WhatsApp Business Platform, this could mean taking your WhatsApp experience a step further by creating an end-to-end shopping experience for your customers with a new custom “flow,” and enabling in-app checkout with the WhatsApp payments feature. 2. Attract new customers The lifeblood of any business is finding more customers. So once you’ve built a valuable experience for your customers, it’s key to drive more people to your WhatsApp channel. To start, add a QR code to your storefront, website, product packaging, marketing materials or any other surface where people coming across your business can easily scan to connect with you on WhatsApp. From there, you can add a WhatsApp button to your Facebook or Instagram account that clicks to open a chat on WhatsApp so customers browsing your business on those platforms can easily start a conversation to ask questions or place an order. To find a brand new set of customers, businesses can take the next step and create Facebook or Instagram ads that click to open a chat on WhatsApp. These ads are an incredibly effective and powerful way to attract new customers and get them to start messaging with your business so you can close the sale. For businesses that run their entire operation directly from WhatsApp, you can now create these ads directly within the WhatsApp Business app. 3. Stay organized Diwali can be an extremely busy week for businesses – especially with so much commerce condensed into just a few days. With a potential influx of chats coming from new customers, it’s essential to keep your business and chats organized to maximize efficiency and sales. One trick is using catalog collections to group and organize products into specific categories so it’s simple for customers to browse your offerings. To stay on top of your chats, label specific ones with customizable descriptions to keep track of things like pending payments, new customers and more. As your customer base and chat volume grow, businesses can graduate from the WhatsApp Business app to the more powerful WhatsApp Business Platform where they can engage with customers at scale.

    "article_content": "It’s remarkable to see how technology has seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, simplifying the way we live. While digitalization has ensured that we get things on our mobile phones, it has ensured that everything becomes more convenient and faster. Even as the agri industry is undergoing a major change currently, the fintech industry is seeing a radical change as both consumers and service providers go online. The food and health industries have also stayed abreast with the times and created innovative products. These are some sectors of the economy that, in 2024, have embraced technology and are contributing to the welfare of all people. Fin-Tech: Indian farmers’ lives are being gradually impacted by agricultural technology, which makes their hard work simpler, increases productivity, and guarantees that they have access to much-needed services. Post-harvest logistics have been transformed by Sohan Lal Commodity Management (SLCM), giving farmers access to larger, higher-paying markets. More than 1.5 lakh stakeholders have come together thanks to their listing platform, Agri Reach, which guarantees that everyone will profit in turn. Additionally, the program instantly permits online quality checks for crops with NABL-accredited labs, a job that formerly took two days. Agri Suraksha has enabled the creation of smart warehouses that are continuously monitored by CCTV powered by solar energy. With the aid of timestamps, this guarantees that malpractices are reduced while the produce is kept safe in the warehouses. Nevertheless, the adoption of these technological advancements by Indian farmers remains sluggish. Consequently, a “Phygital” ecosystem is required, in which physical centers are digitalized to offer the necessary support to farmers. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "As a representative of a sizeable segment of India’s online gaming industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is deeply concerned by the GST Council’s decision to levy 28% GST on the full face value of the consideration instead of just the platform fee, and the many ramifications it will undoubtedly have on India’s digital economy and online gaming industry. Online gaming is distinct from gambling & betting. Hence taxing India’s legitimate online gaming industry with gambling activities will not only massively dent the burgeoning online gaming sector but will also threaten to make the entire $20 billion Indian online gaming sector an unviable business model. The new tax structure is contrary to global best practices, where GST on online gaming is levied on Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) / platform fee. The net effect of this levy will result in an approximate 1,000% increase in GST on the industry and will cause irreversible damage to the $2.5 billion investments in the Indian online gaming start-up ecosystem and lead to a complete halt on any prospective FDI. It shall also serve as a huge blow to India’s ambitious target to achieve a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025. Furthermore, it will put Indian gaming companies at a significant disadvantage against offshore gaming companies and put a hard stop to any plans of India becoming a global hub for online gaming. The industry had proposed to the GST Council during consultations that the 28% GST should be charged on the platform fee, which has been the valuation method so far. IAMAI urges the GST Council and the Central government to reconsider the decision to levy a uniform 28% GST on full face value for online gaming. IAMAI will continue to engage with the GST Council and other stakeholders to ensure that the final GST levels being considered do not hinder the innovation, FDI and the growth of this industry.

    "article_content": "The idea of spinning a wheel and seeing what number it lands on has been a part of the entertainment world for a long time, with roulette invented in the 18th century and money wheel games reaching casinos and TV game shows in the 20th century. How have they remained so popular for so long in our ever-changing entertainment industry? Source: PxHere While many wheel games look similar, the way that they work is different in each case, meaning that this is a genre rather than a single game. This is seen clearly when we look at the game of roulette, which has many versions where the rules, the possible bets, and the number of zero pockets all vary. Online game shows have allowed the sector to flourish even more, with wheels used in a variety of games at sites like Paddy Power. If you play Spin a Win Live at Paddy’s , you bet on the number that the wheel might stop on while it’s also possible to choose a color, odd/even, or a multiplier. Other, similar games such as Crazy Time and Monopoly Live use wheels but have different gameplay. In terms of TV game shows, wheels have traditionally been used to reveal random prizes. but they can also be used to select questions or to decide which contestant plays next. The Wheel of Fortune show has been an ever-present part of American culture since the mid-1970s and has helped make this way of playing something that most people are aware of. While the UK version of Wheel of Fortune will be back briefly in 2024, viewers here have enjoyed several other wheel-themed shows in the past. Source: Unsplash Games featuring wheels have changed in many ways over the years, as new technology has allowed the addition of elements like virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital wheels. However, this hasn’t changed the fact that these games all tend to be extremely simple to understand and play. The most crucial part of any wheel game is the moment when it spins around and then comes to rest. At this point, it’s easy to see what the prize is or find out what happens next. Of course, the moment of tension when it’s spinning adds to the excitement of these games as we wait for the outcome. The random nature of wheels has been appealing to people since the Rota Fortunae in Roman times , while digital wheels retain the same random element that people once associated with the Goddess of Luck. With TV shows featuring prize wheels, we don’t need to watch the show from start to finish to understand what’s happening. It’s easy to jump in and out of these shows and still grasp right away what’s happening as the results are normally obvious from each spin of the wheel. Given the popularity of wheel games in the past and present, it’s easy to imagine that they’ll carry on being widely played long into the future. If they retain the simplicity that is a huge part of their appeal and also continue to have new technology added to them, the future looks bright for wheel games.

    "article_content": "The debate as to whether Poker-like games are skill based or that of pure luck has finally been settled. Some of the skill-based games are quite entertaining and at the same time they test skills and experience, possibly as a brain teaser. Especially games like Poker require the players to use 100 percent of their grey cells. We have handpicked some skill oriented games that wouldn’t just entertain, but also help you otherwise by enhancing abilities like thinking and strategy. Take a look: Poker Poker tops the list of such games owing to its proven prowess as a game that hones a number of skills, and even makes us great workers. It calls for a poker face and the ability to remain composed under pressure, regardless of the suitability of your cards. It also requires the ability to make decisions quickly, calculate probabilities, and persuade people that you might not have the greatest cards. Whoever remains at the table the longest is declared the winner. To reduce your losses, you must also learn when to fold or quit the game. One such site where you may play this skill-based game and make money alongside is Mega Poker. You can play with players who have comparable skill levels, whether they are amateur, intermediate, or professional. Fair play is guaranteed by the RNG-certified platform, which also provides GST cashback. Chess Chess is a brain and wit game in which players must use all of their cognitive power in addition to skill sets that they have developed over years.

Ludo We’ve all played the game with our siblings, cursed our luck when we didn’t get the necessary numbers, and screamed and sobbed when someone cheated. Still, there’s more to this game than pure luck—it’s more about applying the correct analytical skills. To get to your home region before everyone else, you need to know which of the four tokens you need to shift. To win the game, you must plan out every move you make as you go across the ludo board. Steer clear of obstacles and traps while you zigzag your way to victory. Playerzpot offers a Ludo game for you to play. Flush Known by several names, including Three Cards, Flush, or Flash, this game has its roots in India. It’s a spin on the widely played card games in England, such as poker and three-card brag.

    "article_content": "Fujitsu announced that it has been chosen for the “Research and Development Project of the Enhanced Infrastructures for Post-5G Information and Communication Systems/Development of post-5G information and communication systems,” a subsidy project launched by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) under Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s (METI) Generative AI Accelerator Challenge (GENIAC) initiative to enhance Japan’s capability to develop generative AI. Under the subsidy project, Fujitsu will start research and development on technology combining knowledge graphs with large language models to realize LLMs that enable logical reasoning. Fujitsu has been conducting R&D of generative AI technologies for application in business operations. On May 10, Fujitsu in cooperation with a team of researchers announced the release of Fugaku-LLM, a large language model with enhanced Japanese language capability, and plans to continue to strengthen the development of specialized LLMs for various industries and businesses. As part of its R&D activities, Fujitsu has been focusing on the problem posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), a phenomenon in which generative AI creates plausible but incorrect or unrelated output. Fujitsu aims to realize a new technology that strengthens the reliability of LLMs by combining LLMs with knowledge graphs, ultimately enabling the application of LLMs in operations that require high levels of compliance and explainability, including tort determination and basis search in the legal field, internal control and accounting audits in finance, and symptom search and diagnostic support in the medical field. Fujitsu anticipates that the newly developed technology will enable the realization of an LLM for logical reasoning that creates clear and comprehensible outputs. Fujitsu plans to offer the new technology to the Japanese market at the end of fiscal 2024, as a step to further enhance its technologies to protect conversational AI from hallucinations and adversarial attacks announced in September 2023. LLMs that enable logical reasoning To address the task of reliability in the output of LLMs, Fujitsu started development of LLMs specialized in knowledge graph generation and inference, one of the knowledge processing technologies, to make LLMs logically infer answers according to the knowledge graph generated from natural language regulations and rules. Fujitsu plans to position this technology as the core technology of a generative AI trust technology that eliminates output instability and ensure accurate output in compliance with large and complex regulatory and internal regulations, a technique Fujitsu aims to realize in fiscal 2024 as part of its company-wide AI strategy. As part of the GENIAC program, Fujitsu will develop two specialized LLMs: an LLM for knowledge graph generation, which converts natural language documents into knowledge graphs to form knowledge, and an LLM for knowledge graph inference that searches for relevant information on knowledge graphs for a given question, aggregates it logically, and answers it. To efficiently develop two specialized LLMs in a limited development period, Fujitsu will first develop a pre-trained LLM that is common to both specialized LLMs. The advantage of this LLM development is that it enables LLMs to handle both documents in natural language and knowledge graphs by adding a bilingual corpus to the pre-learning data. Specialized LLMs are then developed simultaneously by carrying out instruction learning for knowledge graph generation for the first model, and instruction learning for knowledge graph inference for the second model.

    "article_content": "Dubai is increasingly becoming a global center for artificial intelligence. To this end, the metropolis of the day after tomorrow on the Gulf has pledged to train one million people in AI prompting over the next three years. It is the first program of its kind in the world. “We want to be the most future-ready city and continue to prepare for the AI era by developing expertise and skills that support global technological change and put Dubai at the forefront of innovation,” said by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation (DFF), Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, at the launch of the ‘One Million AI Prompters’ initiative in Dubai. DFF oversees the AI prompt program. The United Arab Emirates, in which Dubai is the most important emirate alongside Abu Dhabi, is preparing for the post-oil era and wants to transform itself from an oil state into an AI power. By 2031, 40 percent of the gross domestic product is to be generated with artificial intelligence. To this end, the UAE is investing billions, has appointed the world’s first Minister of State for AI, is attracting scientists to the Gulf and is providing massive support for start-ups. AI prompt engineering is critical to getting the best out of generative AI. It involves understanding the capabilities, limitations and nuances of AI models and is predicted to be one of the most important skills in the future workplace. ‘One Million AI Prompters’, the first-of-its-kind prompt engineering initiative, that prepares expertise and competencies in AI prompt engineering, which involves crafting precise and effective instructions for AI systems to achieve desired outcomes in various tasks, ranging from generating creative content to solving complex challenges. “We want to show people that there is a full spectrum of use cases. Whether you are technical or non-technical, you can utilise these tools,” said Omar Al Olama, the UAE´s Minister of State for AI, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications. He also highlighted the importance of developing practical prompt engineering skills, as these are crucial for the workforce of tomorrow and for enhancing quality of life through AI. Al Olama was appointed as the world’s first AI Minister of State in the UAE in 2017. World Championship in AI Prompt in Dubai To launch the ‘One Million AI Prompters’ initiative, the first Global Prompt Engineering Championship was recently held in Dubai. Participants competed in categories beyond traditional coding, such as literature and art, highlighting the broad applicability of AI tools. In AI, a prompt refers to a specific request to a language model (e.g. ChatGPT or others) that can provide the user with an answer or solution. The Global Prompt Engineering Championship received thousands of entries from around 100 countries. Thirty finalists from 13 countries qualified to come to Dubai to compete for the title of best prompt engineer in the competition’s three categories. The winners were Australian Megan Fowkes in the art category and Indian Ajay Cyril, 33, for coding and Aditya Nair, 34, in literature. The Dubai Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) provided one million dirhams, approximately 273,000 US dollars, in prize money for the three winners. Global competition around the United Arab Emirates The UAE is increasingly being courted as a strategic partner by global tech giants. Microsoft, Google and IBM already took part in the first championship with workshops. However, other companies and countries have also expressed interest in AI collaborations.

    "article_content": "As part of the Africa Cyber Defense Forum (ACDF), Kaspersky has announced the opening of its first Transparency Center in the African region. The new center, located in Kigali, Rwanda, is opening as part of Kaspersky’s Global Transparency Initiative, established to highlight the reliability of the company’s solutions and advocate for greater transparency throughout the cybersecurity industry. The new center offers its visitors a comprehensive overview of Kaspersky’s engineering and data processing practices, and a live demonstration of the source code for its products and services. Internet penetration in the African region has been steadily increasing over the years: according to the World Bank, broadband Internet access in Africa grew from 26% in 2019 to 36% in 2022. As outlined in the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy, all people in Africa should be digitally empowered by 2030, which means that digitalisation will be enhancing, bringing both opportunities and challenges. The new Transparency Center in Kigali is available for Kaspersky’s partners, customers, and regulators responsible for cybersecurity. It is designed to serve the “blue piste” review option, which has gained significant popularity among Transparency Centers’ visitors since the opening of the first facility in 2018. It offers a general overview of Kaspersky’s engineering and data processing practices: throughout their visit, partners and customers are welcome to ask Kaspersky experts any questions related to the company’s data processing procedures and the functioning of its solutions. Additionally, as part of the “blue piste,” they can improve or acquire skills to assess the security of ICT products that their organisations use, learning the highlights of Kaspersky’s Cyber Capacity Building Program for government organisations, academia and companies. Underscoring the strong nexus between transparency and the fight against cybercrime, and Kaspersky’s commitment to both causes, the new Transparency Center opening was welcomed by the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL): “The African region is currently undergoing rapid digital transformation, with Internet penetration continually growing year on year. To counter potential security risks stemming from the use of technology, it is imperative to understand what forms an effective framework to mitigate risks. Today, as Kaspersky announces the opening of its first Transparency Center in the African region, we appreciate the company’s openness and welcome its Global Transparency Initiative, which is exemplary for organisations in the region in terms of building digital trust. Kaspersky has a proven track record of collaborating with local, regional and international law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime, sharing its technical expertise, in the spirit of transparency,” AFRIPOL’s Acting Executive Director, Ambassador Jalel Chelba, commented. With the opening of the facility in the region, Kaspersky will expand its network to encompass a total of 11 Transparency Centers located across Europe, Asia-Pacific, North and Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Introducing another milestone in the Global Transparency Initiative, Genie Sugene Gan, Head of Government Affairs and Public Policy for Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East, Turkey and Africa regions at Kaspersky, during her keynote speech at the ACDF, noted: “A growing emphasis on cybersecurity within the pan-regional African agenda is piquing the interest of national authorities. However, there remains a significant gap in cyber-capacity building. By opening the Transparency Center, Kaspersky aims to address the local market needs, offering education in such critical areas as evaluating product security and establishing secure development processes. The Transparency Center opening marks a pivotal advancement and a significant milestone for both our organisation and the region, as we bring essential capacity-building capabilities and best cybersecurity practices to the region.” Being a dedicated advocate for enhancing transparency in the cybersecurity industry, Kaspersky launched its Global Transparency Initiative in 2017, becoming a pioneer in advancing digital trust. The initiative reaffirms the company’s readiness to disclose how Kaspersky works, what standards it implements, how its solutions perform and why they are trustworthy. Kaspersky actively involves the broader community in validating and verifying the reliability of its products, internal processes, and overall business operations. As a significant aspect of the Global Transparency Initiative, the company leads as the first cybersecurity vendor to disclose its source code for external review.

    "article_content": "Veeam Software introduced Zero Trust Data Resilience (ZTDR), a model to help organizations reduce the risk of growing data security threats and improve their overall resilience. Developed in collaboration with Zero Trust expert Jason Garbis of Numberline Security, ZTDR applies Zero Trust principles to backup and recovery as an extension to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust Maturity Model. Essential to ZTDR is the separation of backup management systems and their storage tiers into distinct resilience zones to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential blast radius from breaches; and immutable backup storage, to ensure that data cannot be modified even in the event of a ransomware attack. Modern, effective security is based on Zero Trust, replacing the increasingly ineffective perimeter-based security approach. Yet most Zero Trust frameworks do not include the security of data backup and recovery systems, despite the fact backup data is often the primary target of malicious actors in both ransomware and data exfiltration attacks. The Veeam Data Protection Trends Report 2023 found 93% of ransomware attacks are targeting backup repositories. “Backup infrastructure by its nature has a large attack surface, because it must have read and write access to production, spanning virtually all enterprise applications and data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud,” said Jason Garbis, Founder at Numberline Security. “To reduce that risk, Numberline and Veeam are proposing practical Zero Trust Data Resilience tools, including core principles, an architecture, and a maturity model. Our goal is to help organizations fill a gap in their security strategy by extending Zero Trust to backup and recovery to achieve greater cyber resilience.” Within the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, “Data” is one of five pillars, under which it identifies five key functions: Data Inventory Management, Data Categorization, Data Availability, Data Access and Data Encryption. To extend this model to the critical function of data backup and recovery, the ZTDR principles are: To help organizations begin their journey to implement these principles, Numberline has developed a detailed ZTDR Maturity Model, as well as a ZTDR Reference Architecture which includes these key attributes for improved data resilience: “The latest Veeam research shows that 75% of ransomware attacks on backups are successful,” said Danny Allan, CTO at Veeam. “To keep businesses running, it’s essential to ensure data immutability and to follow best practices like Zero Trust Data Resilience (ZDTR). With the ZTDR Maturity Model, every organization can chart their path to greater data security and less down time. While Veeam has always been committed to this architectural approach, we are working with storage partners to implement an industry leading zero trust model.” “To combat escalating cyber threats like ransomware, there is a pressing need to unify and strengthen IT and security effectiveness leveraging frameworks like Zero Trust,” said Christophe Bertrand, Practice Director at ESG. “We have found in our latest ransomware state of the market research that 86% overall think Zero Trust is a key strategy for ransomware protection. Zero Trust Data Resilience is fundamental in addressing those needs to deliver a more robust security posture through faster and safer recovery.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Tenable has published new findings highlighting that the vast majority of Indian cybersecurity and IT leaders (70%) view cloud infrastructure as the greatest source of cyber risk in their organisation. The perceived risks stem from the use of public cloud (36%) and/or multi-cloud (23%) and private cloud infrastructure (10%). Respondents are particularly worried about the complexity introduced when trying to correlate user and system identities, access, and entitlement data. Within this context, 78% of Indian respondents emphasised the importance of considering user identity and access privileges. However, 64% say their organisations struggle to integrate this crucial data into preventive cybersecurity practices, revealing a gap between recognition and practical implementation. These findings are part of the Indian edition of “Old Habits Die Hard: How People, Process and Technology Challenges Are Hurting Cybersecurity Teams in India,” based on a commissioned study of 825 IT and cybersecurity professionals including 69 Indian respondents conducted in 2023 by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Tenable. The report outlines the challenges and risks associated with cloud infrastructure. As well as specific cloud security concerns, the Tenable study highlights that 57% of Indian respondents express that a lack of data hygiene in user data and vulnerability management systems prevents employees from making prioritisation decisions. Additionally, 56% of organisations spend 11 hours or more per month creating security reports for business leaders and 46% of them use multi-tabbed spreadsheets to analyse data from different solutions. While 28% hold monthly meetings on business-critical systems, 9% of organisations only meet once a year (or less), indicating a need for more consistent strategic discussions on organisational security. The study also showed that 78% of respondents allocate 25 or more employees to tasks related to deploying, supporting, maintaining, and managing vendor relationships for cybersecurity tools. This underscores the substantial human resources required for effective cybersecurity measures. Kartik Shahani, country manager at Tenable India, said, “Almost everything in the cloud is one excess privilege or misconfiguration away from exposure. The intricate cloud landscape prompts organisations to resort to various tools and point solutions to counteract these threats. Unfortunately, this approach drains resources, leading to substantial costs as they grapple with configuring and implementing disparate products. Effectively securing the cloud requires more than just technical proficiency; it demands a nuanced understanding of assets, vulnerabilities, and their alignment with overarching business objectives.” Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "McAfee unveils its second annual “Modern Love” study, about the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in online dating, and the implications this has for increased catfishing and romance scams. This study surveyed 7,000 people in seven countries worldwide, including India. The rise of powerful AI tools complicates the online dating landscape. By leveraging easy-to-use AI tools, romance scammers can craft convincing messages and realistic profile images to trick people looking for love online. The key findings of this study revealed that 77% of Indians said they’d come across fake profiles and/or photos that look AI-generated on dating websites or apps, or on social media. Further, the prevalence of romance scams emerged with 39% of Indians saying their conversations with a potential love interest online turned out to be with a scammer. 26% said they’d talked with a potential love interest, to discover it was actually an AI-generated bot and not a real person. 91% of Indians revealed they, or someone they know, have been contacted by a stranger through social media or text message and started to “chat” with them regularly to know them better. With that in mind, those looking for love are often more vulnerable to scams when connecting with strangers, and cybercriminals use that vulnerability to their advantage by engaging in long and sophisticated attempts to steal from victims. Furthermore, the study also discovered that more than half, 65% Indians have used ChatGPT/AI to help create pics or other content for a dating app. Specifically this Valentine’s Day, 56% of Indians are planning to or considering using AI to write messages for their love interest as it helps boost their confidence. However, this contrasts sharply with people’s feelings about receiving AI-generated content: 60% of people said they would be hurt or offended if they found out their Valentine’s message was written by a machine / Artificial Intelligence. Despite mixed feelings and experiences, the effectiveness of AI is undeniable: 81% of people reported receiving more interest and better responses using AI-generated content than when they drafted or used their own original content. And if you’re not on dating apps/sites, the McAfee Labs team reveals you still need to exercise caution online with an increase in Valentine-related scams. This includes Valentine-related malware campaigns (25% surge), malicious URLs (300% increase), and a variety of romance-themed spam and email scams (a staggering 400% increase), with the majority focused on Valentine’s shopping and gifts. McAfee Labs expects these numbers will continue rising as February 14 gets closer, urging vigilance. “The possibilities of AI are endless, and unfortunately, so are the perils. For people who are shy about starting conversations, short on time to craft the perfect message, or whose photos could be brightened, AI offers tools to help enjoy all the fun and excitement that comes with online dating.,” said Steve Grobman, McAfee’s Chief Technology Officer. “Unfortunately, we know cybercriminals also use AI to scale malicious activity. With love-seekers spending more time online leading up to Valentine’s Day, scammers are using AI to pose as love interests to steal your money or personal information. We encourage people to balance romantic hope with healthy skepticism, to pause before sharing sensitive information online, and to ensure they use the right tools to protect their privacy, identity, and personal information,” continued Grobman.

    "article_content": "Norton launched Dark Web Monitoring in India, now available as part of Norton 360 Premium, Norton 360 Deluxe and Norton 360 for Gamers plans. With Dark Web Monitoring, Norton monitors and notifies people if their personal information is found on the dark web, allowing the individual to take action such as contacting financial institutions or changing passwords to help protect against fraud. The dark web is a small part of the web where anonymity is prized and nefarious activities can run amok, including the exchange of illegal goods and information. When people’s addresses, Aadhaar numbers, EPF information, credit card data and other personally identifiable information end up on the dark web, criminals can utilize it for fraud, from financial to identity theft. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for this information to end up in the wrong hands – in 2023 it was announced that the Aadhaar numbers, passport information along with names, phone numbers of 815 million Indians were found on the dark web. On the occasion of the announcement, Ritesh Chopra, India Director, Gen said, “We are thrilled to launch Norton’s Dark Web Monitoring feature in India. This innovative addition to our security package enables customers to proactively protect their digital identities in a time when cyber dangers are always present. We keep an eye out for any hacks, compromised credentials, and illegal activity by continuously searching the shadowy corners of the internet. This way, we can make sure that your sensitive information is protected from prying eyes of hackers.” He further added, “Our Dark Web Monitoring feature actively searches the dark web for your email address and other personal data you choose to register and issues a notification should that data be discovered. With Dark Web Monitoring we are offering another tool to help protect and empower people to live their digital lives more safely.” When a customer subscribes to a Norton plan that includes Dark Web Monitoring, the email address registered to the Norton plan will be monitored automatically on the dark web, while the easy-to-use dashboard allows for personally identifiable pieces of information to be added for monitoring. Monitored information includes: up to five insurance account numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, and up to ten credit card numbers as well as gamer tags. If data is found on the dark web, whether through forums or websites, a notification allows for direct action to be taken, including changing a password, or contacting a trusted service provider. Dark Web Monitoring is now available in Norton 360 Premium, Norton 360 Deluxe and Norton 360 for Gamers. Current customers with an active subscription can now access Dark Web Monitoring for the remainder of their subscription at no extra cost through an automatic update.

    "article_content": "Palo Alto Networks introduced a host of new security solutions to help enterprises thwart AI-generated attacks and effectively secure AI-by-design. Leveraging Precision AI, the new proprietary innovation that combines the best of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) with the accessibility of generative AI (GenAI) for real-time, the global cybersecurity leader is delivering AI-powered security that can outpace adversaries and more proactively protect networks and infrastructure. Nikesh Arora, chairman and CEO, Palo Alto Networks, said, “Enterprises must move even faster beyond disparate processes and solutions to recognize the benefits of a connected platform that represents more than just a tech stack — but instead a critical business mechanism and undeniable driver of success. Platformization is the approach needed, and integrated solutions that can both protect and enable AI are integral to achieving results. Precision AI by Palo Alto Networks is the game changer that will create a new paradigm in security — perhaps for the first time — where the defender is ahead of the adversary.” Palo Alto Networks has infused Precision AI across its platforms — Strata, Prisma and Cortex delivering new capabilities to address key enterprise use cases: Palo Alto Networks Precision AI Future-Proofs Business Operations AI is poised to unleash the next wave in efficiency, experience and growth across all industries by 2030. Deloitte reports the AI cybersecurity market is expected to hit $102.78 billion by 2032, a further indication of the pervasive adoption of AI. As much as AI is a boon to enterprises, it is also being highly leveraged by adversarial actors for evasive, unique and damaging zero-day attacks that traditional security solutions cannot detect. To quantify it, Palo Alto Networks sees an average of 2.3 million new and unique threats every day that weren’t there the day before and blocks an average of 11.3 billion threats inline per day — adding to the urgency in which platformization and Precision AI must be adopted. “In today’s accelerated environment to adopt and deploy AI, organizations should realize that input equals output exponentially. The input being the volume and quality of the data via integrated solutions and systems that will produce the precise AI output to enable their desired outcomes,” commented Frank Dickson, group vice president, IDC . The benefits of Precision AI by Palo Alto Networks are realized through Palo Alto Networks platformization approach for integrated capabilities and data accessibility. Platformization eliminates the boundaries of disparate solutions to streamline security and improve operational efficiency. Palo Alto Networks customers are recognizing the major benefits from adopting a unified platform of security products that are tightly integrated across network, cloud and SOC environments. Availability: New Palo Alto Networks solutions powered by Precision AI will be made generally available in Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25. Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Bloguter Breaking News The Rise of Botnet and DDoS Attacks July 29, 2022 technuter 0 Comments Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have become an everyday or, some might argue, an hourly problem. Using a variety of techniques, a wide range of threat actors from lone hackers, criminal gangs and hacktivists, to nation-states have and are using DDoS attacks. These attacks are carried out to degrade or disable the performance and network communications of target systems. These targets can be small or large businesses, internet service providers, manufacturers, retailers, healthcare providers, schools and universities, or other nation-states. Essentially, any entity with an online presence can become a DDoS target. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Now, here is the why. There are three main reasons why people create botnets: For financial gain by extortion—pay up or we keep attacking; to make a point—stop (or start) doing something or we continue; or, in the case of nation-state actors, as an espionage or cyber warfare tactic. In our previous blog post we covered the history of DDoS attacks and our A10 Networks DDoS Threat Report, which reviewed the techniques used in DDoS attacks. In this article we’re going to cover the how of botnet and DDoS attacks, the most common mechanism for delivering attacks using collections of remotely controlled, compromised services or devices. What is a Botnet? The bots of a botnet can include computers, smartphones, virtualized machines, and/or a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras, smart TVs, routers, anything that has internet connectivity and can be compromised. In particular, IoT vulnerabilities and misconfigurations are extremely common in the consumer market making it very easy for hackers to create an IoT botnet. Moreover, botnets, particularly when they become part of an IoT botnet, can be enormous; a single botnet can be comprised of hundreds of thousands or even millions of hijacked devices. Hijacking devices for a botnet involves finding devices that have security vulnerabilities to make it possible to be infected with “botware,” malware to be installed on the device. But the devices infected with botware aren’t the only thing a botnet needs. Many sources—including as of writing Wikipedia—appear to be confused about what constitutes a botnet. While the most obvious part of a botnet is the collection of devices it includes, the defining component is the existence of a command and control (C&C) system that controls what the network of bots does. The botware on each compromised device communicates with the botnet command and control system and becomes part of a network of bots. Driven by commands from a “botmaster” or “botherder”—the person or group controlling the bots—some or all of the devices in the botnet do whatever they are asked to do. Botnet Command and Control The early communications between botnet command and control systems and botware on compromised devices were based on the client-server model using, for example, Internet Relay Chat (IRC). The botware connected to an IRC channel and waited for commands. Each bot can also respond on the same channel with status updates or remotely acquired data. Alternatives to IRC include the use of Telnet connections and HTTP requests for webpages or custom services. It’s worth noting that some botnets have used a hierarchical C&C system where layers of bots communicate in a client-server fashion with the bots in the layer above and relay commands to the layer below them. The latest botnet command and control communications for botnets are based on peer-to-peer (P2P) connections. In this model, compromised devices discover each other by scanning IP address ranges to find specific port and protocol services and, when another botnet member is identified, sharing lists of known peers and relayed commands. This type of highly distributed mesh networking is obviously more complicated to create but also much harder to disrupt. The Rise of the IoT Botnet IoT devices include a huge range of commercial and consumer devices such as temperature measurement systems, smart TVs, IP cameras, smart door bells, security systems, network routers and switches, and even children’s toys. Despite a huge amount of commentary and warnings about IoT vulnerabilities and well-understood fixes to improve their security, basic defenses such as requiring effective passwords and not allowing default logins and user accounts are still ignored. Another source of IoT vulnerabilities comes from vendors not providing updates to address security problems and or the device owners failing to apply updates. What Do Botnets Do? Botnets are used for four main purposes and, generally, a botnet can be switched as a whole or in parts between any of these functions. Spam and Phishing One of the earliest uses of botnets was for generating spam, unsolicited commercial or fraudulent email. By using bots for this purpose, spammers avoid the problem of getting their bulk sending IP addresses blacklisted and even if some bots get blacklisted, there’ll always be more bots to use. A more targeted use of botnet spam is for phishing for identity theft. By generating huge amounts of spam email messages inviting recipients to visit promotional websites, websites that appear to be banks or other financial institutions, enter competitions, etc., scammers try to harvest personal information such as bank account details, credit card data, and website logins. Pay-per-Click Fraud To increase website ad revenues—advertising networks such as Google pay-per-click on adverts the websites serve—botnets are used to fake user interaction. Because of the distributed nature of the sources of the clicks, it’s hard for the ad networks to identify click fraud. Cryptomining By running the algorithms that mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether on tens of thousands of bots—an IoT botnet is the perfect platform. It thereby steals computer power from the device’s owner, and allows significant revenue without the usual costs of mining, mostly importantly, the cost of electricity. DDoS Attacks as a Service Distributed Denial of Service attacks are easily launched using botnets and, as with botnet generated spam, the distributed nature of the bots makes it difficult to filter out DDoS traffic. Botnets can execute any kind of DDoS attack and even launch multiple attack types simultaneously. A relatively new hacker business is DDoS-as-a-Service. On the Dark Web and now, even on the regular web, you can buy DDoS attacks for as little as $5 per hour; the pricing depends on the required scale and duration of the attack. A Very Brief History of Botnets Arguably, the first true internet botnet was Bagle, first discovered in 2004. Bagle was a Windows worm that relayed spam sent from a botmaster. While the first version, called Bagle.A, was of limited success, the second version, Bagle.B infected something like 230,000 computers. On New Year’s Day 2010, the malware was responsible for roughly 14 percent of all spam. By April 2010, Bagle was sending approximately 5.7 billion spam messages per day. As with most malware, other hackers copied and improved the code with over 100 variants found in the wild by 2005. Since then, arguably the first botnet to launch a DDoS attack was Akbot in 2007. The Akbot botnet was created by an 18-year-old in New Zealand. It used a C&C system based on IRC and at its peak involved 1.3 million computers. Over time, botnet attacks have become commonplace and the biggest botnet known to date, the Russian BredoLab botnet, consisted of 30,000,000 devices. The Future of Botnet and DDoS Attacks Botnets are here to stay. Given the exponential growth of poorly secured IoT devices that can be co-opted into an IoT botnet as well as the growing population of vulnerable computers, botnet attacks have become endemic. As a cyber warfare tool, botnet and DDoS attacks have been observed on both sides of the Russian operation against Ukraine. Whether you’re a government organization or a private company, you should be planning how you’re going to deal with a botnet and DDoS attack. Your first step is to realize that no online property or service is too big or too small to be attacked. Second, plan for increased bandwidth ideally on an as needed basis. The ability to scale up your internet connection will make it harder for a botnet and DDoS attack to saturate your access and cut you off from the internet. The same elastic provisioning strategy applies to using cloud services rather relying than on-prem or single data center services. Next, consider using or expanding your use of a content delivery network to increase your client-side delivery bandwidth. Using multiple CDNs also increases your resistance to DDoS attacks. Finally, harden everything. Strategically deploying hardware and software DDoS mitigation services throughout your infrastructure is key to making botnet and DDoS attacks have minimal impact.

Deloitte has added the Tenable One Exposure Management Platform, Tenable Cloud Security and Tenable OT Security to its portfolio of available cyber solutions for Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT) cyber risk management. Leveraging Tenable’s exposure management capabilities, Deloitte and Tenable’s shared customers can harness the power of proactive security and help remove noise by bringing their attack surfaces – on-premise and cloud-based – into a single view. Tenable One provides customers with the necessary comprehensive visibility, the breadth of vulnerability coverage, and depth of context-driven risk analytics to prioritise actions based on likelihood of attack to reduce cyber risk. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Jeff Brooks, senior vice president, Global Channels and Business Development, Tenable, said, “As a platform-first company, we strive to offer cybersecurity solutions that unite data, simplify risk assessment and take the guesswork out of risk reduction by putting critical context and actionable insights front and centre. By collaborating with Deloitte, organisations will be able to use preventive security measures to better understand their cyber risks and help resolve issues before they can be exploited by threat actors.” Will Burns, Deloitte’s US Cyber Detect & Respond Adversary Pursuit Leader and a Managing Director, Deloitte & Touche LLP, said, “We are constantly working to enrich our cyber ecosystem for the benefit of our clients, and the addition of the Tenable One platform to it is a continued demonstration of that commitment. We look forward to Deloitte and Tenable’s shared clients finding new ways to understand their exposure data and to quickly mitigate risks impacting their specific environments.” Tenable One enables organisations to centralise their exposure data sources into one view, as they also can: Add Comprehensive Visibility – gain a unified view of all assets and associated software vulnerabilities, exposures, misconfigurations and excessive entitlements by continuously assessing environments for cyber risk. Predict and Prioritise – anticipate the consequences of a cyberattack by drawing upon over 211,000 Nessus plugins and understand relationships between assets, exposures, privileges and threats across an attack path. Effectively Communicate Cyber Risk – answer stakeholders’ critical questions such as “Where are we exposed?” and “How secure are we?” with ease. The centralised and business-aligned view of cyber risk within Tenable One enables organisations to accurately and effectively communicate cyber risk and set clear KPIs to show progress overtime by benchmarking against external peers.

    "article_content": "Bloguter Breaking News How Ethical Personalization can Enhance Trust and Unlock Savings January 16, 2023 technuter 0 Comments From delivering customer support to special offers after customers have browsed certain products, businesses rely on personalized digital experiences. While customers appreciate thoughtful personalization, however, many are uncomfortable with the sense of being spied on. Marketers face their own challenges when balancing engaging personalization and privacy, not least from regulators. For those operating globally, to comply with new and constantly evolving guidelines means investing in different platforms and regimes across multiple jurisdictions. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As consumers grow more aware of data privacy, their peace of mind is essential to companies unlocking the benefits of personalization. Having the right software is key to ensuring that data is managed properly, boosting marketer and developer productivity, and availing of opportunities to build better customer relationships. Striking the right balance between personalization and privacy According to Salesforce’s 2022 State of the Connected Customer Report, 52% of customers expect offers to always be personalized. Yet 74% of consumers feel companies collect more personal information than they need and 64% feel companies aren’t as transparent as they should be when it comes to personal data use. Personalization and privacy don’t have to be at odds. Leaning into ethical data tools and services can be an essential design principle for ensuring digital experiences are built to enhance trust. There are four key ways that companies can unlock value and savings by implementing ethical personalization. Create consumer-facing data policies and practices, and communicate these in simple, understandable language. For brand and operational consistency, companies should also implement these policies at all levels – not just in training or guidance but in the software. By embedding ethical use into data collection, use, retention, and expiration processes, everyone across the organization can focus on differentiated and ethical customer engagement. Decrease the data “productivity tax” to free up marketers’ time. It’s estimated that marketers are losing between 8% and 12% of their overall production time to inefficient data management. By carefully designing the way data are collected, retained, and used, businesses can cut this productivity tax and free up teams’ time to deliver personalized experiences instead. Keep more first-party data. Having a complete view of the customer enables organizations to tailor communications to their specific needs and interests which will drive incremental sales and margins. Yet, on average, companies lose 8% of their first-party data due to time spent cleaning, preparing, and managing. By improving tools and communication with customers about data collection, organizations can avoid throwing away this valuable information. Maximizing Value for Businesses and Consumers Consumers are more likely to do business with companies they trust. Data can be incredibly valuable for improving the customer experience, but it must be used ethically and responsibly. The more transparent they are about their personalization strategy, the easier it will be for customers to understand what data they should provide and how it will be used. By building safeguards and protections into products and practices, partnering with engineering and product teams to consider the privacy implications, and working closely with customers to explore thoughtful data collection, companies can deliver remarkable experiences for their consumers while deepening trust. With the right mindset, partners, and technology, privacy and personalization can work hand-in-hand.

New beginnings are an opportunity to reflect on where we’ve been and where we’re going. We’re certain our partner ecosystem will help customers prepare for the journey to come, from hybrid work and hybrid cloud to the edge and sustainability initiatives. That’s why we remain committed to our goal: to be the preferred technology vendor for our Partners and Distributors. As we roll out the 2023 Partner Program, we’re building upon a position of partner strength. In Q3, partners delivered approximately 50 percent of our overall net revenue, accelerated double digit storage growth, and helped us secure #1 positions in the majority of the industry’s critical IT infrastructure categories. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); With this momentum behind us, we recognize that consistency is key. We are setting higher standards to support partners, grow and modernize Dell’s core business, and create market opportunities. We continue to strengthen collaboration and streamline the partner experience, all while holding to our commitment to leverage Dell technology to drive human progress. Our Partner Program is designed to help partners make the most of the opportunities ahead. “As a longtime Dell Technologies partner, CDI values consistency and predictability in the Dell Partner Program. Dell’s unwavering commitment to supporting its partners gives us the peace of mind that Dell will be there to help navigate the market together and drive our joint success.” — Rich Falcone, CEO and President, CDI Grow and Modernize the Core Business Our capabilities and competitive advantages position us to grow and create value for our partners. In September, we announced enhancements to the Dell APEX portfolio and expanded outcome-based offer resell availability for partners in additional locations worldwide. We’re seeing strong partner momentum with Dell APEX and this is just the beginning. We listened to partner feedback and today, we’re announcing enhancements to our APEX partner opportunity: Consolidated product category: To simplify our incentive structure, we are introducing a single and harmonized APEX+ category for all incentive-eligible Dell APEX solutions, now including Dell APEX Flex on Demand in addition to Dell APEX outcome-based offers. Rebates and earned MDF apply across the full category for eligible partners. Partner deployment: Partners can now deploy select Dell APEX solutions on their own terms with the launch of partner deployment. Partners can use existing Service Delivery Competencies to gain more control over their Dell APEX deployment options and expand value-added specialty services. Dell APEX competency: We’ve launched a Dell APEX competency to help partners learn the portfolio. While partners get up-to-speed on this competency, all metal tiered partners will be eligible for base rebates on APEX+ offerings. “Dell helps Presidio’s global customers experience streamlined digital transformation by providing intuitive, scalable and consistent solutions that deliver measurable results. The new Dell APEX partner-led deployment capability in the 2023 Partner Program allows us to deploy Dell APEX to our customers within our unique outcome-based model.” — Raph Meyerowitz, Engineering VP, Technology Solutions and Strategic Partnerships, Presidio Build Market Opportunities In addition to the enhanced Dell APEX portfolio and Services deployment competency training, we’re launching persona-based training to help partners ramp faster. Three tracks have launched: Foundation, for those new in career; Develop, for those who are new to Dell Technologies; Technical, for those looking to develop their skills. We’re also unlocking opportunities for partners through our streamlined Partner Program structure, first announced in 2022. The changes introduced last year are now fully operational, including one tier structure, one incentive structure, and one set of requirements, allowing partners to choose the best route to market for their business and customers, without compromising their earning potential. “Regular training and learning opportunities are crucial for enabling partners to sell all offerings with confidence. Dell provides dedicated pre-sales learning paths for its product portfolios, arming partners with the knowledge needed to educate their customers, and rewarding partners with increased incentive eligibility for completing training competencies.” — Adrianna Bustamante, VP, Partnerships, Rackspace Technology Strengthen Collaboration and Streamline the Experience We are squarely focused on the partner experience. We’ve invested in our technology stack, process redesign, simplification of policies and support model. Partners are telling us that it’s working. Over the past three years we’ve seen acceleration of B2B e-commerce engagement. We’re making the purchasing experience even easier in 2023 with pre-configured Server and Storage bundles, increased pricing transparency and expedited ordering. “Dell is a company you can win with. They have always been by our side, in both good and challenging times. The 2023 Program provides partners with a robust set of tools, coupled with the resources, scale and talent of one of the largest IT infrastructure companies in the world. Dell has a strong track record of successful execution, and its Program consistently provides partners with significant opportunity for growth, no matter the environment.” — Salvador Morales, CEO, Compucare de Mexico Drive Human Progress At Dell, our purpose is to create technologies that drive human progress, and we can go even further and faster when we work with our partners.

    "article_content": "Bloguter Unlocking the Benefits of AI and Data Analytics: Opportunities, Risks, and Responsible Use April 17, 2023 April 17, 2023 technuter 0 Comments AI and data analytics are becoming increasingly important in today’s business landscape. The global AI market is projected to reach $190 billion by 2025, and the data analytics industry is expected to become a $77 billion industry by 2023. Businesses must adopt and employ data mining, machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing to explore how they can solve problems and improve operations, and user experience, and stay competitive in manufacturing, healthcare, finance, logistics, and retail industries. While there are many valuable facets of AI, such as RPA, computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, video analytics, forecasting, predictions, insights, and robotics, businesses must also navigate the risks and challenges of improper use of these technologies. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); AI systems that are biased or programmed incorrectly can discriminate against individuals or groups, and the use of AI in safety-critical systems can result in accidents and injuries. To mitigate these risks, businesses must adhere to the core ethics of AI, such as fairness and bias, trust and transparency, accountability, social benefit, and privacy and security. Openness to modification, model drift, governance, scalability, and transparency are some of the major challenges with AI. However, trends like machine learning, increased automation, conversational AI, and AI for social good will advance the field in the future. Industry leaders, such as Mr. Deepak Goel, Customer Success Leader at Prolifics stress the importance of properly evaluating and understanding how to best use AI. He suggests that companies must infuse AI into customer interactions, offices, and the workforce to effectively operationalize it, leveraging the benefits of cutting-edge technology while minimizing risk factors. Microsoft’s incident with its AI chatbot named Tay in 2016 serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of AI and the need for better safeguards against inappropriate use. Microsoft recommended enhanced filtering, more human oversight, openness, accountability, and education to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. They acknowledged the need for educating users about AI systems, as well as the necessity for increased human intervention and better moderation to prevent dangerous conduct. Their response demonstrated a dedication to risk mitigation, ethical use, and responsible AI development. Even for that matter, Amazon’s AI recruiting tool turned out to be a blunder when it discriminately shortlisted only male resumes over female. After this embarrassing incident, Amazon immediately stopped using it and found out that the tool was biased due to the data used to train it, which favored male candidates over female candidates. To address this, Amazon updated its training data, audited other AI systems, provided additional employee training, and developed new tools and processes to evaluate job candidates. They emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring and testing to prevent bias and discrimination in their AI systems. It is essential for end-users to understand how AI and data analytics work, so they can make informed decisions while minimizing the associated risks and challenges. They must also be aware of the potential biases that can be present in AI systems and how these biases can impact decision-making. In conclusion, AI and data analytics have tremendous potential, but businesses must approach these technologies with caution and awareness of the risks involved. As Deepak Goel puts it, “Companies must carefully evaluate AI’s impact and how best to use it, so they can leverage its benefits while minimizing the risks.” Authored by:- Mr. Deepak Goel, Customer Success Leader at Prolifics (The views expressed in this article are by – Mr. Deepak Goel, Customer Success Leader at Prolifics.

    "article_content": "Bloguter Amid the pandemic, Rau’s IAS live-online classes provide a lifeline for UPSC aspirants preparing for the IAS exam April 27, 2023 technuter 0 Comments The education sector has been severely affected by the pandemic, and students preparing for competitive exams such as the UPSC Civil Services Exam (CSE) have been hit the hardest. These students are used to physical classroom teaching and depend heavily on coaching institutes for IAS preparation . However, the lockdown restrictions imposed to fight COVID-19 have limited their options for quality guidance. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Rau’s IAS Study Circle has adapted to online teaching methodology to ensure that its students’ IAS exam preparations are not hampered by the restrictions. Rau’s IAS Interactive-Online classes are designed to replicate the offline experience, allowing teachers to teach in the same manner as they would in a physical classroom. The interaction between students and teachers is multiparty, enabling students to ask questions and clarify doubts while also benefiting from peer learning. To ensure that its students receive quality guidance, Rau’s IAS has created an E-learn platform that provides access to frequent homework, regular class tests, and opportunities for doubt solving and discussion. The platform also includes video backups of live-online classes, as well as access to additional teaching and testing resources. Interactive-Online classes for IAS exam Rau’s IAS Interactive-Online classes enable teachers to teach in exactly the same manner as they used to teach in the classrooms in offline mode. Interaction between students and teachers is the same as an offline class since students are able to ask and clarify doubts from the teacher. Also, this interaction between students and teacher is multiparty i.e. all the students can see each other and listen to others’ doubts thereby making learning more participative. The multiparty interaction enables teachers to read the online class (are students confused, should more examples be used to clear concepts, etc.) and customize the delivery of their content to suit the online classroom dynamic. Also, the multiparty nature of the classes, makes students feel the positive side of peer-pressure propelling them to stay focused; and that eventually leads to improved learning. Rau’s IAS Study Circle is the first IAS coaching academy which has pioneered in teaching through interactive-online classes. For Rau’s IAS, just organizing information for delivery isn’t teaching but teaching is all that can be done to ensure that the students learn the concepts and acquire skills to use those under practical settings (UPSC Prelims exam and UPSC Mains exam). To replicate the offline experience, Rau’s IAS has created its E-learn platform to offer everything that has been part of the physical classroom experience. Rau’s IAS online learning platform (elearn.rauias.com) enables: Teachers to assign frequent homework (objective and written) to help students revise daily. Assessment : Regular class tests are conducted to check if students are succeeding at the goals for which they started learning. Doubt Solving : We understand that in every classroom there are students who don’t ask doubts fearing that they may be the only one struggling. The platform takes care of those students as well by giving them access to ask their teachers questions even after class. The platform has been, in fact, tailor made with special focus on doubts solving and discussions. It focuses on increasing interactions between teachers and students. Students can also engage in group discussions and improve through Peer learning. Video back-up of Live-online classes is provided : All live lectures are subsequently made available as recorded videos so students could watch them again to revise concepts. Access is given to more teaching and testing resources like the current affairs videos, test discussion videos, class notes, study material, current affairs magazines, UPSC Prelims Test Series and upsc Mains Test Series, etc. With the conduct of interactive-online classes and delivery of coursework through Rau’s IAS E-learn platform, Rau’s IAS students feel absolutely no difference between online and offline learning experience. Quality guidance is now available to everyone at the touch of a button We understand, that UPSC aspirants come from all walks of lives, from different background and therefore their approach to studies is different. Many UPSC aspirants prepare for the IAS exam while balancing work, college education and family life which may make juggling between that and time bound physical classes, difficult. For conventional classroom coaching, students have to travel to campus, but with the online coaching, guidance is available within the safe confines of their homes. Many IAS aspirants reside in far flung areas and commuting to campus to attend physical classes six times a week is impractical and taxing. Another issue is that, for some students learning outcomes may be thwarted by societal distractions and they’d like to study via an alternate medium to stay focused. Some learners have a unique learning style and pace. Rau’s IAS Online courses for UPSC exam provide a unique avenue for IAS aspirants to juggle the demands of their daily lives on their scarce time and other resources, while still being able to prepare for and crack IAS exam. Generally speaking, for working professionals, parents, international students, students with disabilities and students located in far flung areas, an IAS course delivered online by Rau’s IAS (experts in the field of UPSC Civil Services coaching) can be hugely beneficial. Also, during these pandemic conditions, all students who wish to socially distance themselves and study from the safety of their home, can also take advantage of Rau’s IAS online courses. The future of Online IAS coaching One must understand that education requires “high-quality guidance” from teachers. Technology is ‘‘just’’ a medium. High quality guidance can be delivered by teachers effectively online as well if they are trained to use technology appropriately. We have trained our teachers to use instructional technology to teach and resolve doubts. Our teachers are proficient to use technology to enhance student learning outcomes through active student engagement, collaborative learning and frequent feedback to evaluate teaching absorption. Rau’s IAS has integrated technology in its instruction and curriculum. Rau’s IAS online classes make students feel like they are in the classroom. There is no denying the fact that students have to depend on online teaching for the time being as that is the only available medium of learning, but we feel that online teaching will be a practical solution for many, even after the pandemic. From student’s feedback regarding the efficacy of online classes and online learning experience as a whole, it is evident that Rau’s IAS Online course has emerged as an effective and reliable solution for preparing for UPSC exam.

    "article_content": "Apps Automobile Kia introduces new K-Charge Initiative featuring 1000+ Charging Stations in India December 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Kia India unveiled K-Charge — an innovative initiative in the ‘MyKia’ app that allows users to discover over 1000 EV charging stations nationwide. In one of the industry-first moves, Kia is extending access to this charging network to non-Kia customers, providing valuable assistance to Indian EV users in overcoming Range Anxiety. This strategic move reflects Kia’s commitment to enhance customer services by consolidating various functions into one user-friendly smartphone app. Kia has collaborated with 5 charging point operators (CPOs): Statiq, ChargeZone, Relux Electric, Lion Charge, and E-Fill charging operators to enable this initiative. Kia India has also done a special tie-up with Relux Electric to offer its customers 3 months of free charging through their charging stations. The onboarded CPOs are the pioneers in the EV charging industry, providing adequate networks, global best practices, and safety protocols. Integrating these CPOs on the ‘MyKia’ app is done by NumoCity Technologies – one of the leaders in CMS services. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The new features offer additional convenience to EV users through deeper technology integration, empowering them to seamlessly access a wide range of EV services right at their fingertips. The users can view and locate the charging station through an interactive map of the Made-in India map service provider – Map My India. Through K-Charge, customers can check the availability of charging slots, locate one based on their preferences and even pay through the same platform using the wallet service within the app. The array of user-friendly functionalities not only simplifies EV charging but also removes the need to rely on multiple external applications, demonstrating Kia’s vision of embracing technology to improve the vehicle ownership experience. Mr. Hardeep Singh Brar, National Head of Sales and Marketing – Kia India, said, “K-Charge is not just a convenience initiative for our customers but a step towards making sustainable mobility convenient and accessible for everyone. We strongly believe that the technology transition towards a complete EV future ought to be smooth, and the K-Charge, integrated into the ‘MyKia’ app, is a well-thought-out step in that direction. With this aim, we will continue our efforts towards expanding the charging network through the onboarding of new CPOs in the future. We are confident that seamless, user-friendly solutions like these will play a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in India.” Through its newly introduced vision – ‘EV for All’, which encompasses the K-Charge initiative, Kia aims to achieve an annual sales target of one million EVs by 2026 and expand that to 1.6 million units annually by 2030 aided by the launch of various long-range BEVs. In India, Kia has already shared its EV strategy, which lays out the launch of global EV models in India along with a locally manufactured EV in the RV body style by 2030.

The MoU has three key objectives. First, it seeks to broaden the use of UPI payments for travelers outside of India, enabling them to conveniently make transactions abroad. Second, the MoU intends to assist in establishing UPI-like digital payment systems in other countries, providing a model for seamless financial transactions. Lastly, it focuses on easing the process of remittances between countries by utilizing the UPI infrastructure, thereby simplifying cross-border financial exchanges. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The outlined objectives will help accelerate UPI’s global acceptance, providing foreign merchants access to Indian customers who will no longer have to rely only on foreign currency and/or, credit or forex cards for making digital payments and will have the option using UPI powered Apps from India including Google Pay. This is in alignment with NPCI’s endeavor of bolstering India’s position in the global digital payment landscape. Moreover, the MoU will also significantly contribute to simplifying remittances by reducing dependence on conventional money transfer channels. Deeksha Kaushal, Director, Partnerships, Google Pay India said, “We are delighted to support NIPL towards expanding the reach of UPI to international markets. Google Pay has been a proud and willing collaborator to NPCI and the financial ecosystem, under the regulator’s guidance, and this collaboration is another step towards our commitment to making payments simple, safe and convenient. UPI has demonstrated to the world the step change that happens in economies with the introduction of interoperable, population scale digital infrastructure and each economy that joins such networks will create impact beyond the sum of parts. We are very excited about the scope of this collaboration.” Ritesh Shukla, CEO – NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL), said, “We are pleased to team up with Google Pay to propel UPI onto the global stage. This strategic partnership will not only simplify foreign transactions for Indian travelers but will also allow us to extend our knowledge and expertise of operating a successful digital payments ecosystem to other countries. We are also excited about enabling a seamless and more connected international remittance network by further expanding UPI’s cross-border interoperability feature. With the success of UPI in a dynamic market like India we are excited to further our vision to transform the digital payments landscape globally. The global expansion of UPI represents a transformative step in international commerce, enabling a seamless, secure, and cost-effective payment experience for both merchants and customers worldwide.

    "article_content": "Apps Swiggy inks MoU with IRCTC March 5, 2024 technuter 0 Comments Swiggy and the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) have signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) to deliver pre-ordered food on trains. The MoU was exchanged between Mr Sanjay Kumar Jain, Chairman and Managing Director, IRCTC and Mr Rohit Kapoor, CEO, Swiggy Food Marketplace, in the presence of senior officials from both organizations. As part of the MoU, Swiggy will deliver food from its extensive restaurant network to passengers on the Indian railways starting with Bangalore, Bhubaneshwar, Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada. The service is likely to expand to 59 additional city stations in the coming weeks. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Speaking about partnership , Mr Sanjay Kumar Jain, Chairman and Managing Director, IRCTC, said, “At IRCTC our focus has always been to explore new ways to make train journeys comfortable and convenient for the billions of passengers aboard the Indian railways every year. This partnership with Swiggy will bring more convenience and food options to our passengers, making their journeys more memorable.” “Swiggy’s mission is to bring convenience to the lives of consumers. The Indian Railways are the lifeline of our nation, transporting more than 8 billion passengers annually. If during these rail journeys, which traverse across states and districts, one has the option to order meals to explore the culinary diversity of India, it would make the experience more convenient and enjoyable, and add to the overall vividness of the train travel,” said Mr Rohit Kapoor, CEO, Food Marketplace, Swiggy . One of the challenges encountered by travelers during extended journeys is the paucity of diverse culinary options. Through this integration, passengers aboard designated trains now have the option to savour good-quality, warm meals delivered right to their seats, thereby transforming their travel into a convenient and delightful culinary experience. “IRCTC and Swiggy collaboration is natural in several ways. Both the organisations have built a reputation of leveraging technology to improve consumer experience. Both have a pan-India presence. In the first phase, we are starting with deliveries on stations of Bengaluru, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar. We are hopeful of a buoyant response from passengers and restaurant operators on this route, which will hopefully lead to us providing services on more stations and on newer routes,” added Kapoor. Passengers can avail pre-ordered food services via Swiggy by following the below steps: Input the PNR on the IRCTC app Select the preferred station for food delivery Browse through an extensive list of restaurants on Swiggy Choose a restaurant that is delivering at the specified location and time The food delivered to passengers will be packed in insulated Swiggy bags to keep the meal warm and fresh. Swiggy’s delivery partner would reach the selected platform X mins before delivery, hand over the food to the customer and mark the food delivered. To ensure smooth operations, effective issue resolution and maximum comfort for the passengers, Swiggy’s support agents will be trained in resolution process, gratification & cancellation policies. The support agents will also be equipped to connect with restaurants and delivery partners based on the order status and the nature of the customer issue.

A first for any quick commerce or e-commerce platform, customers can now enjoy the convenience of having FASTag delivered directly to their doorstep. The FASTags will be available to users on Swiggy Instamart across 29 cities. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); An essential for modern-day car owners, there has been consistent adoption of FASTag with over 7.98 crore FASTags issued in India as of November 2023. With Park+’s smart parking and vehicular management systems, users can digitally pay at a toll, or a parking spot at a mall, corporate park, or movie hall using FASTag.

Phani Kishan, Head of Swiggy Instamart said, “FASTag stands for seamless payment and convenience, and access to it should be the same. Traditionally, purchasing a FASTag involved applying through a bank portal or physically visiting a toll booth on a highway, leading to waiting times ranging from 3 to 7 days for card delivery and activation. With FASTag now available on Swiggy Instamart, users can procure it anytime, anywhere, slashing delivery wait time from days to under 10 minutes.” Commenting on the partnership, Amit Lakhotia, Founder & CEO, Park+ , said, “At Park+ our main objective is to bring delight back to car ownership. As part of this endeavour, we have partnered with Swiggy Instamart to reduce the TAT for car owners buying a FASTag. As the largest FASTag distributor in India, we are well-poised to address the current gap within the FASTag ecosystem. Our robust relationship with IndusInd bank allows us to deliver IndusInd FASTags to customers in less than 10 minutes, thanks to Swiggy Instamart. Furthermore, we are also working with relevant FASTag issuing partners to educate users about FASTag buying/renewal/recharge, etc. We will continue to invest our energies in enhancing the car ownership experience for car owners, throughout the life cycle of their car and look forward to partnering with other external stakeholders to support us in this endeavour.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "E-commerce Honeywell’s New Augmented Reality Solution Set To Elevate Consumer’s Shopping Experience November 30, 2023 technuter 0 Comments For every festive shopping season, solutions that enhance the customer experience and help speed their decisions are increasingly critical. To optimize retail operations and efficiency, Honeywell announced the latest release of its powerful SwiftDecoder barcode-decoding software, designed to make shopping easier and help ensure a seamless retail experience. Used by companies worldwide to scan millions of barcodes each day, SwiftDecoder transforms camera-enabled devices into efficient barcode scanners, offering fast and accurate data capture. For retailers, it seamlessly integrates the software’s augmented reality plug-ins into both store associate- and customer-facing applications. This integration boosts productivity by enabling the scanning of shelf tags and visually overlaying graphics and information on the screen. This is beneficial for store associates managing inventory and ensuring price label accuracy, as well as for customers seeking promotional and nutritional details, helping to provide a frictionless checkout experience. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); David Barker, president of Honeywell Productivity Solutions and Services, said, “SwiftDecoder is enabling retailers to create innovative applications that revolutionize the customer journey. Fast and frictionless checkouts not only boost customer satisfaction but also improve operational efficiency, allowing businesses to embrace a forward-thinking shopping experience. With Honeywell technology, accurate and real-time product information is delivered to both associates and customers, leading to higher-quality customer interactions. This convergence of technology and consumer empowerment is helping to reshape the retail landscape, promising a future where frictionless, efficient, and convenient shopping is the new norm.” Ashish Modi, president, Honeywell India, said, “The Indian digital economy is growing exponentially, and the Indian retail industry is embracing digital transformation for better outcomes that include improving customer experience and enhancing process efficiency. As a global leader in mobility solutions, Honeywell Technologies are enabling productivity and efficiency for retailers. The new SwiftDecoder barcode-decoding software leverages augmented reality, has high reliability in handling intricate workflows, swift data capture, enhances the shopping experience, and will be a game-changer in shaping the future of retail.” As we gear up for the next festive season and the shopping season continues, solutions enhancing the customer experience and bringing speed to shoppers’ decisions will be critical. With purchasing options like click and collect and innovative options like “Shop and Go” – where consumers can complete purchases in-store without interacting with an associate – the adoption of SwiftDecoder presents an opportunity to create unique shopping experiences that will keep consumers coming back for more. Research firm Gartner reported that customer experience influences 66% of loyalty, surpassing price and brand combined, and 94% of consumers are more likely to make future purchases with a positive experience. Reduced wait times at checkout mean that more customers can be served in a shorter period which, in turn, can increase the store’s overall sales potential. This technology can also facilitate better inventory management by providing real-time data on product popularity and availability, helping businesses make more informed stocking decisions. SwiftDecoder’s advanced image-processing algorithms can be used in many different devices, including mobile phones, tablets, computers, wearable scanners, drones, and kiosks for a variety of retail and logistics applications.

    "article_content": "E-commerce ONDC and WinZO collaborate to boost digital commerce in India May 17, 2024 technuter 0 Comments In a move aimed at democratizing access to digital commerce and fostering transparent and fair market access, WinZO is collaborating with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). This collaboration will leverage WinZO’s extensive user base of over 175 million users, primarily accessing the internet in vernacular languages. WinZO is India’s first skill gaming company to collaborate with ONDC. WinZO is the largest interactive entertainment platform in India. The company partners with third-party developers to host games on their app, providing users with personalized multiplayer gameplay experiences in 12 languages. The WinZO platform facilitates over 4 billion micro-transactions per month across a portfolio of 100+ games and accounts for at least one out of every 300 UPI transactions in India, representing one of the highest volumes of UPI transactions driven by digital content players in India. WinZO is renowned for its unique user demographic, primarily hailing from Tier II-V cities of Bharat, characterized by high-frequency, low-value transactions or microtransactions. This makes it an organic partner for ONDC to reach the deepest corners of the country. Remarkably, over 20% of players on WinZO make their first-ever digital payment on the platform, thus connecting to the digital grid. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As a business model, WinZO connects game developers with paying users, generating revenue higher than alternative sources such as advertisements and in-app purchases prevalent on Play Stores and App Stores. ONDC’s transparent, competitive, and open-market philosophy aligns with WinZO’s broader vision. WinZO Store, India’s pioneering alternative to monopolistic multinational app stores, offers ONDC a remarkable opportunity to help digital businesses enhance revenue generation and reach a broader market. ONDC, which encompasses a network for grocery and food delivery, mobility, fashion, agri-products, and health and wellness, will list its services on the WinZO store, providing access to WinZO’s growing 175 million users. WinZO Store charges a single-digit commission compared to the 30% of other leading distribution platforms. By significantly reducing commission rates compared to conventional app stores, WinZO Store empowers digital businesses to enjoy improved profit margins, creates value for end-users, and provides businesses access to expanded distribution channels. Already, over 300 digital companies have experienced unprecedented revenue growth through this revolutionary platform. WinZO has also emerged as a more trustworthy and transparent alternative for multinational gaming studios to list and distribute in-app gaming assets through its WinZO Store, thereby facilitating value creation for developers and users. Integrating with WinZO Store aligns perfectly with ONDC’s mission to empower businesses and foster innovation within India’s digital landscape while eradicating power concentration in the hands of a few monopolistic influential players. “We’re super excited and delighted in welcoming WinZO to the ONDC network to advance our mission of empowering local homegrown start-ups,” said T Koshy, CEO of ONDC . “Together, we aim to revolutionize the digital commerce industry, fostering a vibrant ecosystem where Indian talent and innovation takes center stage. Our collaboration will help the growth of local commerce and showcase the immense potential of India’s digital landscape.” “Our aim is to onboard diverse businesses and establish a public digital infrastructure akin to UPI, uniquely crafted for India. We’re thrilled to see WinZO seamlessly integrated into this network, opening new avenues for engagement and innovation. Partnering with WinZO will enable ONDC to reach a wider user base, even in the remotest parts of the country, and create awareness about its importance in the rapidly growing tech-enabled commerce in Bharat. This will prove to be a massive push for adopting ONDC,” said Sanjeev Singh, Joint Secretary of DPIIT . “In the digital age, democratizing innovation is key to unlocking the potential of tomorrow’s entrepreneurs. Just as UPI revolutionized payments in 2018 and gave birth to companies like ours to emerge and scale across 175 million gamers. With the integration of WinZO and ONDC, we envision a future where many more WinZOs will emerge and innovate on top of this fertile layer of digital commerce that’s being built today through this partnership,” said Paavan Nanda, Co-founder of WinZO . With a vision to democratise and decentralize innovation and fresh wave of new companies emerge for example in 2018 when payments were democratised with UPI. WinZO on the back of UPI reached 175 million users and we are very happy and excited and hopeful that integration of WinZO and ONDC will lead to many more WinZO’s of tomorrow.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Global Tech Fujitsu chosen for GENIAC project, starts development of large language models for logical reasoning May 17, 2024 technuter 0 Comments Fujitsu announced that it has been chosen for the “Research and Development Project of the Enhanced Infrastructures for Post-5G Information and Communication Systems/Development of post-5G information and communication systems,” a subsidy project launched by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) under Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s (METI) Generative AI Accelerator Challenge (GENIAC) initiative to enhance Japan’s capability to develop generative AI. Under the subsidy project, Fujitsu will start research and development on technology combining knowledge graphs with large language models to realize LLMs that enable logical reasoning. Fujitsu has been conducting R&D of generative AI technologies for application in business operations. On May 10, Fujitsu in cooperation with a team of researchers announced the release of Fugaku-LLM, a large language model with enhanced Japanese language capability, and plans to continue to strengthen the development of specialized LLMs for various industries and businesses. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As part of its R&D activities, Fujitsu has been focusing on the problem posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), a phenomenon in which generative AI creates plausible but incorrect or unrelated output. Fujitsu aims to realize a new technology that strengthens the reliability of LLMs by combining LLMs with knowledge graphs, ultimately enabling the application of LLMs in operations that require high levels of compliance and explainability, including tort determination and basis search in the legal field, internal control and accounting audits in finance, and symptom search and diagnostic support in the medical field. Fujitsu anticipates that the newly developed technology will enable the realization of an LLM for logical reasoning that creates clear and comprehensible outputs. Fujitsu plans to offer the new technology to the Japanese market at the end of fiscal 2024, as a step to further enhance its technologies to protect conversational AI from hallucinations and adversarial attacks announced in September 2023. LLMs that enable logical reasoning To address the task of reliability in the output of LLMs, Fujitsu started development of LLMs specialized in knowledge graph generation and inference, one of the knowledge processing technologies, to make LLMs logically infer answers according to the knowledge graph generated from natural language regulations and rules. Fujitsu plans to position this technology as the core technology of a generative AI trust technology that eliminates output instability and ensure accurate output in compliance with large and complex regulatory and internal regulations, a technique Fujitsu aims to realize in fiscal 2024 as part of its company-wide AI strategy. As part of the GENIAC program, Fujitsu will develop two specialized LLMs: an LLM for knowledge graph generation, which converts natural language documents into knowledge graphs to form knowledge, and an LLM for knowledge graph inference that searches for relevant information on knowledge graphs for a given question, aggregates it logically, and answers it. To efficiently develop two specialized LLMs in a limited development period, Fujitsu will first develop a pre-trained LLM that is common to both specialized LLMs. The advantage of this LLM development is that it enables LLMs to handle both documents in natural language and knowledge graphs by adding a bilingual corpus to the pre-learning data. Specialized LLMs are then developed simultaneously by carrying out instruction learning for knowledge graph generation for the first model, and instruction learning for knowledge graph inference for the second model.

    "article_content": "Fintech 5 Simple Ways to Master Personal Loan Repayment December 7, 2023 technuter 0 Comments In a world where the cost-of-living soars and unexpected expenses are a part of daily life, personal loans have emerged as a vital lifeline for many. Thanks to digitalization, obtaining these loans has become easier than ever. As of February 2023, outstanding personal loans have surged to over ₹40 lakh crore, marking 20.4% y-o-y, from the previous year’s ₹33 lakh crore, as per RBI data. Keeping this in mind, timely repayments will not only help in maintaining financial stability but also boost creditworthiness. The key to mastering personal loans lies in responsible usage and a misstep, like defaulting on EMIs, can swiftly plunge you into a debt trap. Therefore, mastering personal loans involves not just obtaining funds but strategically managing and repaying them, creating a path towards financial resilience and stability in an unpredictable world. Consider these five effective ways to repay your loan with ease. Prioritize Personal Loan Repayment Taking charge of your finances starts with crafting a budget. Use it to analyze your monthly income and expenses by tracking your expenses. Commit to a monthly budget that covers all your needs and cut back on unnecessary spending. Before you jump into the personal loan world, make repayment your top priority. Sync your EMI payment date with your salary date, putting it at the forefront of your monthly financial commitments. Alternatively, create a dedicated fund solely for covering your EMIs, ensuring consistent and timely repayments without financial bumps. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Opt for Debt Consolidation Tired of juggling multiple loans and timely payments? Combine all your debts into one personal loan for a simpler repayment process and maybe even a lower interest rate with debt consolidation. It’s a cost-effective solution, especially. When you have various obligations, like personal loans, keeping up with monthly payments can be tough. Get a debt consolidation loan to merge all your bills, including credit card debt, into one. Enjoy the ease of a single monthly payment at a fixed interest rate, potentially lowering your overall interest costs. Consider another income source or sell ideal assets To boost your income and tackle personal loan repayments, explore side businesses or monetize your interests. Renting out a property or discussing potential income sources can help you create additional funds for loan repayment, thus reducing your debt-to-income ratio. Another way is to sell the idle assets by liquidating investments like real estate, gold, or mutual funds can provide the necessary funds to pay off your loan and effectively manage your finances. Close the Personal Loan Early with Part-Payments Accelerate your journey to debt freedom by making part-prepayments when possible. Beyond regular EMIs, channel extra funds toward the principal amount. This not only chips away at the principal but also reduces the accruing interest. If circumstances allow, consider foreclosing the personal loan entirely, albeit with potential foreclosure charges. While this approach demands financial discipline, the reward is a quicker and more affordable resolution. Take Personal Loans Responsibly Above all, approach personal loans with a sense of responsibility. View them as tools to navigate temporary financial challenges, and only take them when armed with a clear repayment plan. Understanding the commitment involved and making informed decisions can transform personal loans from potential pitfalls into stepping stones toward financial stability. While managing personal loans need not be a daunting task but one needs to be careful in planning, making strategic choices, and being responsible to navigate the repayment journey smoothly. Remember, financial freedom is achievable with the right mindset and a well-thought-out repayment strategy.

    "article_content": "Fintech Remote and Nium Join Forces to Power Global Workforces with Real-time Cross-border Payments June 6, 2024 technuter 0 Comments Remote has selected Nium, the global leader in real-time cross-border payments, to enhance its international payroll capabilities. The partnership will be launched on a global scale, enabling businesses to instantly send employee payroll and contractor payments worldwide. The global multicounty payroll solutions market is expected to approach $10.5 billion USD by 2030. Much of this growth is concentrated in emerging markets, with the Philippines, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia among the top 10 destinations for payroll payments facilitated by Nium in 2023. Today, the fintech company has sent $2 billion USD in payroll payments to 134 countries around the world. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As more businesses look at new markets to power growth, the ability to hire and scale across borders is rapidly becoming a key differentiator. But for global companies, managing multi-country payroll can be complex, with local compliance, technology, and cultural norms to navigate. As workforces expand internationally, even more difficult challenges arise creating a scalable, secure, and reliable international payroll model – without incurring excessive foreign exchange (FX) or transaction costs, significant risk, and back-office inefficiencies. Today, tens of thousands of companies use Remote to find, hire, manage, and pay talent all over the world. Now, the global HR platform has partnered with Nium to expand its real-time cross-border payments capabilities and geographic coverage, so it can continue to deliver best-in-class payroll solutions for its new and existing corporate customers. As India emerges as a key destination for global business expansion, managing multi-country payroll complexities becomes pivotal. Remote and Nium’s collaboration is tailored to address the unique needs of Indian businesses, providing them with scalable, secure, and compliant international payroll solutions while mitigating excessive foreign exchange costs and back-office inefficiencies. The partnership will initially launch in 20+ markets across Europe, the United Kingdom, and Asia, supporting disbursement models including corporate payroll and contractor payments. This is the start of an exciting roadmap for the fintech duo, with plans to add more payment corridors, markets, and methods to the combined offering in future. Job van der Voort, CEO and Co-Founder at Remote, said, “As companies become increasingly global, the complexities of expanding compliantly across international borders also grow. Our partnership with Nium is designed to address these complexities head-on. Payroll is at the heart of any business and our partnership provides customers even greater confidence in their abilities to grow teams that stretch globally and still get paid on time, every time, in their local currency – no matter where they are in the world.” With access to Nium’s global real-time payments infrastructure, Remote can provide its clients with multi-currency wallets, allowing funding in over 20+ local currencies and avoiding the hassle of setting up and managing local bank accounts. Live interbank exchange rates can be locked in for up to 24 hours and converted to make cross-border payroll in bulk. Employee and contractor payouts can be sent via flexible payment options to bank accounts, cards, and e-wallets in over 220+ markets and 100+ real-time corridors around the world. Prajit Nanu, CEO and Founder at Nium, said, “If businesses want to stay competitive, it’s crucial that mission-critical payments like payroll don’t just work, but work well. And yet, companies continue to rely on legacy infrastructure or limited cross-border payment solutions to pay their employees and contractors worldwide. After all, payroll isn’t just about money. It’s about employers finding new ways to deepen connections, improve retention, and say thank you to their increasingly diverse and globally dispersed employees. We’re helping Remote deliver this differentiation to its customers and look forward to enabling people and businesses all over the world to realise the full potential of real-time cross-border payments together.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Game IAMAI Deeply Concerned with GST Council’s Ruling on Online Gaming July 12, 2023 technuter 0 Comments As a representative of a sizeable segment of India’s online gaming industry, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) is deeply concerned by the GST Council’s decision to levy 28% GST on the full face value of the consideration instead of just the platform fee, and the many ramifications it will undoubtedly have on India’s digital economy and online gaming industry. Online gaming is distinct from gambling & betting. Hence taxing India’s legitimate online gaming industry with gambling activities will not only massively dent the burgeoning online gaming sector but will also threaten to make the entire $20 billion Indian online gaming sector an unviable business model. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The new tax structure is contrary to global best practices, where GST on online gaming is levied on Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) / platform fee. The net effect of this levy will result in an approximate 1,000% increase in GST on the industry and will cause irreversible damage to the $2.5 billion investments in the Indian online gaming start-up ecosystem and lead to a complete halt on any prospective FDI. It shall also serve as a huge blow to India’s ambitious target to achieve a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025. Furthermore, it will put Indian gaming companies at a significant disadvantage against offshore gaming companies and put a hard stop to any plans of India becoming a global hub for online gaming. The industry had proposed to the GST Council during consultations that the 28% GST should be charged on the platform fee, which has been the valuation method so far. IAMAI urges the GST Council and the Central government to reconsider the decision to levy a uniform 28% GST on full face value for online gaming. IAMAI will continue to engage with the GST Council and other stakeholders to ensure that the final GST levels being considered do not hinder the innovation, FDI and the growth of this industry.

    "article_content": "Game Why Are Wheel Games Still So Popular in the Entertainment Industry? December 13, 2023 technuter 0 Comments The idea of spinning a wheel and seeing what number it lands on has been a part of the entertainment world for a long time, with roulette invented in the 18th century and money wheel games reaching casinos and TV game shows in the 20th century. How have they remained so popular for so long in our ever-changing entertainment industry? (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Source: PxHere The Variety of Games While many wheel games look similar, the way that they work is different in each case, meaning that this is a genre rather than a single game. This is seen clearly when we look at the game of roulette, which has many versions where the rules, the possible bets, and the number of zero pockets all vary. Online game shows have allowed the sector to flourish even more, with wheels used in a variety of games at sites like Paddy Power. If you play Spin a Win Live at Paddy’s , you bet on the number that the wheel might stop on while it’s also possible to choose a color, odd/even, or a multiplier. Other, similar games such as Crazy Time and Monopoly Live use wheels but have different gameplay. In terms of TV game shows, wheels have traditionally been used to reveal random prizes. but they can also be used to select questions or to decide which contestant plays next. The Wheel of Fortune show has been an ever-present part of American culture since the mid-1970s and has helped make this way of playing something that most people are aware of. While the UK version of Wheel of Fortune will be back briefly in 2024, viewers here have enjoyed several other wheel-themed shows in the past. Source: Unsplash They Still Have Simple Gameplay Games featuring wheels have changed in many ways over the years, as new technology has allowed the addition of elements like virtual reality, augmented reality, and digital wheels. However, this hasn’t changed the fact that these games all tend to be extremely simple to understand and play. The most crucial part of any wheel game is the moment when it spins around and then comes to rest. At this point, it’s easy to see what the prize is or find out what happens next. Of course, the moment of tension when it’s spinning adds to the excitement of these games as we wait for the outcome. The random nature of wheels has been appealing to people since the Rota Fortunae in Roman times , while digital wheels retain the same random element that people once associated with the Goddess of Luck. With TV shows featuring prize wheels, we don’t need to watch the show from start to finish to understand what’s happening. It’s easy to jump in and out of these shows and still grasp right away what’s happening as the results are normally obvious from each spin of the wheel. Given the popularity of wheel games in the past and present, it’s easy to imagine that they’ll carry on being widely played long into the future. If they retain the simplicity that is a huge part of their appeal and also continue to have new technology added to them, the future looks bright for wheel games.

Some of the skill-based games are quite entertaining and at the same time they test skills and experience, possibly as a brain teaser. Especially games like Poker require the players to use 100 percent of their grey cells. We have handpicked some skill oriented games that wouldn’t just entertain, but also help you otherwise by enhancing abilities like thinking and strategy. Take a look: Poker (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Poker tops the list of such games owing to its proven prowess as a game that hones a number of skills, and even makes us great workers.

It also requires the ability to make decisions quickly, calculate probabilities, and persuade people that you might not have the greatest cards. Whoever remains at the table the longest is declared the winner. To reduce your losses, you must also learn when to fold or quit the game. One such site where you may play this skill-based game and make money alongside is Mega Poker. You can play with players who have comparable skill levels, whether they are amateur, intermediate, or professional. Fair play is guaranteed by the RNG-certified platform, which also provides GST cashback.

Ludo We’ve all played the game with our siblings, cursed our luck when we didn’t get the necessary numbers, and screamed and sobbed when someone cheated. Still, there’s more to this game than pure luck—it’s more about applying the correct analytical skills. To get to your home region before everyone else, you need to know which of the four tokens you need to shift. To win the game, you must plan out every move you make as you go across the ludo board. Steer clear of obstacles and traps while you zigzag your way to victory. Playerzpot offers a Ludo game for you to play. Flush Known by several names, including Three Cards, Flush, or Flash, this game has its roots in India. It’s a spin on the widely played card games in England, such as poker and three-card brag.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Channel News Cloud MongoDB expands collaboration with Google Cloud April 12, 2024 technuter 0 Comments MongoDB at Google Cloud Next ‘24 announced an expanded collaboration with Google Cloud to make it even easier and more cost-effective to build, scale, and deploy generative AI applications using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and Vertex AI from Google Cloud, along with additional support for data processing with BigQuery. The companies are also collaborating on new industry solutions for retail and manufacturing, with deeper product integrations and solutions to provide a seamless development environment for creating engaging shopping experiences and data-driven applications for smart factories. For customers looking to run workloads that use highly sensitive data, MongoDB Enterprise Advanced (EA) is now available on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC). “MongoDB’s strong partnership with Google Cloud is the result of our close collaboration to meet the unique demands of organisations across industries,” said Alan Chhabra, Executive Vice President of Partners at MongoDB. “Being awarded Google Cloud Partner of the Year – Marketplace is a testament to our commitment to providing the best solutions for customers building modern applications, while operating under the highest levels of security and data privacy requirements. We look forward to continuing to grow our partnership as more customers choose MongoDB and Google Cloud to enhance their businesses with new classes of generative AI applications.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Customers continue to tell us they want world-class generative AI support built into the leading tools they already use, such as MongoDB.” said Stephen Orban, Vice President of Migrations, ISVs, and Marketplace at Google Cloud. “MongoDB and Google Cloud have already helped thousands of joint customers successfully build and deploy applications with MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud. We’re excited to continue to build on this strategic partnership and provide even more ways for developers to quickly and effectively create and enhance applications with generative AI, including access to leading models through Vertex AI and automated data pipelines with BigQuery.” Partnered since 2018, MongoDB and Google Cloud have helped thousands of joint customers—including Keller Williams, Powerledger, and Ulta—adopt cloud-native data strategies to modernise how they run their organisations and serve end users. The expanded collaboration between MongoDB and Google Cloud now allows customers to: Seamlessly isolate and scale generative AI applications for high performance and efficiency: MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes—now generally available on Google Cloud—provide dedicated infrastructure for generative AI and relevance-based search workloads that use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search and MongoDB Atlas Search. MongoDB Atlas Search Nodes are independent of core operational database nodes and allow customers to isolate workloads, optimise costs, and reduce query times by up to 60 percent. For example, a financial services company running a high-traffic application during tax season can use dedicated infrastructure with Atlas Search Nodes to optimise performance independent of their database by isolating and scaling the generative AI portion of the workload. With this capability, the company could scale a knowledge retrieval workload that uses MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for AI-powered agents that autonomously take action on behalf of end users—without having to resize their entire database. Streamline building generative AI applications with leading foundation models: MongoDB Atlas Vector Search has provided an integration with Vertex AI since last year to give developers more choice of managed foundation models to build generative AI applications. Now, with a deepened integration, developers can use a dedicated Vertex AI extension to make it even easier to work with generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs)—from Anthropic, Google Cloud, Meta, Mistral, and more—without having to transform data or manage data pipelines between MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud. This allows developers to more easily augment LLMs with an organisation’s real-time operational data to build applications that provide context-aware and highly personalised end-user experiences that are more accurate, up to date, and trustworthy—all with less complexity. Developers can also use the new extension to input natural language in the Vertex AI console to automatically generate queries for manipulating data and performing database operations (e.g., create, read, update, delete) on data stored in MongoDB Atlas for a more seamless experience. Enhance analytical workloads with automated pipelines for operational data: BigQuery is a serverless, scalable, and cost-effective enterprise data warehouse that works across clouds for analytics, business intelligence (BI), and machine learning workloads. Customers currently use bi-directional sync between BigQuery and MongoDB Atlas to enhance their analytical workloads with real-time operational data or to easily provide end-user applications access to historical enterprise data. With a new integration for Spark stored procedures with BigQuery, customers can better automate, optimise, and reuse data processing workflows between BigQuery and MongoDB Atlas for analytics, BI, and end-user applications. For example, customers can automate pipelines that combine and transform real-time operational data stored in MongoDB Atlas with analytical data in BigQuery and send it to Vertex AI to create new types of end-user application experiences. Enrich data from the factory floor with real-time application data to optimise manufacturing and supply chain operations: Tens of thousands of organisations rely on MongoDB Atlas to securely store, process, and manage real-time application data of diverse types with high performance and scale. Manufacturers today want to modernise their operations by combining data from many sources like factory equipment sensors, end-user applications, and enterprise resource planning systems to automate decision-making and run more efficiently. However, many organisations are unable to transform their operations because they still rely on legacy technologies that are difficult to replace and cost-prohibitive to modernise. With a new technical integration between MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud Manufacturing Data Engine, manufacturers can now more easily combine and transform data from across their organisations to automate processes and optimise operations with modern, real-time applications. Easily build and deploy applications that provide modern shopping experiences with composable commerce capabilities : Retail organisations are at the forefront of inventing new customer experiences with personalisation and automation. However, building applications that support these types of experiences at scale can be cumbersome and complex. To address these challenges, MongoDB is joining Google Cloud’s Industry Value Network (IVN) partner program, an initiative that streamlines the development of differentiated end-to-end solutions across industries through collaboration with system integrator partners to accelerate innovation. Beginning with a new solution for retailers, customers can now take advantage of MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud using the Integrated Commerce Network from Kin + Carta, a digital transformation consultancy, to deploy a modern commerce architecture to meet their unique business needs and provide customers with highly engaging shopping experiences. Run highly sensitive workloads in a tightly controlled and secured environment: Governments, public sector organisations, and enterprises in regulated industries often struggle to modernise their operations because of the highly sensitive nature of their data. As a result, these organisations face limited choices when running workloads. With MongoDB EA on GDC, organisations can now build, deploy, and scale applications in an air-gapped environment without needing to connect to Google Cloud or the public internet. MongoDB is among the first software providers to offer a validated solution for the new Google Cloud Ready—Distributed Cloud program , a marketplace that provides tailored integrations to support use cases for customers with highly sensitive workloads. GDC enables governments, public sector organisations, and regulated enterprises to address strict data residency and security requirements, and combined with MongoDB EA, these organisations can now modernise all of their operations with the flexibility needed to securely deploy innovative applications and features while protecting sensitive data. MongoDB and Google Cloud joint customers and partners welcome expanded partnership Founded in 2009, Rent the Runway is disrupting the trillion-dollar fashion industry and changing the way women get dressed through the Closet in the Cloud, the world’s first and largest shared designer closet. “MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud is fantastic because it provides the whole set of infrastructure, which we don’t have to take care of, so we can focus on our solutions and innovations,” said Mike Liberant, Senior Director of Software Engineering at Rent the Runway. “For example, MongoDB Atlas enables us to process our garments more quickly and accurately without human error, which ultimately means our customers get a better, faster service to rent more and spend less. MongoDB and Google Cloud have been great partners, providing the services and tools where we require them.” Kin + Carta, a global digital transformation consultancy, helps companies modernise their business to better address the evolving needs of their customers. “Through the Integrated Commerce Network, we’re showcasing the best-in-breed software partners who together make building an end-to-end commerce solution much easier,” said Tara Catalano, National Google Cloud Alliance Lead at Kin + Carta. “MongoDB’s connectors and integrations with both BigQuery and Vertex AI make it a compelling choice for customers who want flexibility and optionality in building the best composable solution for their needs, as well as positioning them well to seize the opportunity with generative AI.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Breaking News .conf24: Splunk Report Shows Downtime Costs Global 2000 Companies $400B Annually June 13, 2024 technuter 0 Comments Splunk in collaboration with Oxford Economics released a new global report “The Hidden Costs of Downtime,” which highlights the direct and hidden costs of unplanned downtime. The survey calculated the total cost of downtime for Global 2000 companies to be $400B annually, or 9 percent of profits, when digital environments fail unexpectedly. The analysis revealed the consequences of downtime go beyond immediate financial costs and take a lasting toll on a company’s shareholder value, brand reputation, innovation velocity and customer trust. Unplanned downtime — any service degradation or outage of a business system — can range from a frustrating inconvenience to a life-threatening scenario for customers. The report surveyed 2,000 executives from the largest companies worldwide (Global 2000) and showed downtime causes both direct and hidden costs as defined below: (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Direct costs are clear and measurable to a company. Examples of direct costs are lost revenue, regulatory fines, missed SLA penalties and overtime wages. Hidden costs are harder to measure and take longer to have an impact, but can be just as detrimental. Examples of hidden costs include diminished shareholder value, stagnant developer productivity, delayed time-to-market, tarnished brand reputation and more. The report also highlighted the origins of downtime — 56 percent of downtime incidents are due to security incidents such as phishing attacks, while 44 percent stem from application or infrastructure issues like software failures. Human error is the number one cause of downtime and the biggest offender for both scenarios. However, there are practices that can help reduce downtime occurrences and lessen the impacts of direct and hidden costs. The research revealed an elite group of companies — the top 10 percent — are more resilient than the majority of respondents, suffering less downtime, having lower total direct costs and experiencing minimal impacts from hidden costs. These organisations are defined as resilience leaders and their shared strategies and traits provide a blueprint for bouncing back faster. Resilience leaders are also more mature in their adoption of generative AI, expanding their use of embedded generative AI features in existing tools more than at four times the rate of other organisations. The Combined Direct and Hidden Costs The repercussions of downtime are not limited to a single department or cost category. To provide a multifaceted view, the report surveyed Chief Financial Officers ( CFOs) and CMOs, as well as security, ITOps and engineering professionals to quantify the cost of downtime across several dimensions. Key findings on the impacts of downtime include: Revenue loss is the number one cost. Due to downtime, lost revenue was calculated as $49M annually, and it can take 75 days for that revenue to recover. The second largest cost is regulatory fines, averaging at $22M per year. Missed SLA penalties come in third at $16M. Diminishes shareholder value. Organisations can expect their stock price to drop by as much as 9 percent after a single incident, and on average, it takes an average of 79 days to recover. Drains budgets due to cyberattacks. When experiencing a ransomware attack, 67 percent of surveyed CFOs advised their CEO and board of directors to pay up, either directly to the perpetrator, through insurance, a third party, or all three. The combination of ransomware and extortion payouts cost $19M annually. Curbs innovation velocity. 74 percent of technology executives surveyed experienced delayed time-to-market, and 64 percent experienced stagnant developer productivity, as a result of downtime. Any service degradation often results in teams shifting from high-value work to applying software patches and participating in postmortems. Sinks lifetime value and customer confidence. Downtime can dilute customer loyalty and damage public perception. 41 percent of tech executives in the report admit customers are often or always the first to detect downtime. In addition, 40 percent of Chief Marketing Officers ( CMOs) reveal that downtime both impacts customer lifetime value (CLV), and another 40 percent say it damages reseller and/or partner relationships. Globally, the average cost of downtime per year is more costly for U.S. companies ($256M) than their global counterparts due to various factors including regulatory policies and digital infrastructure. The cost of downtime in Europe reaches $198M, and $187M in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC). Organisations in Europe — where workforce oversight and cyber regulation are stricter — pay more in overtime wages ($12M) and to recover from backups ($9M). Geography also shapes how quickly an organisation recovers financially post-incident. Europe and APAC hold the longest recovery times, while companies in Africa and the Middle East recover the fastest. “Disruption in business is unavoidable. When digital systems fail unexpectedly, companies not only lose substantial revenue and risk facing regulatory fines, they also lose customer trust and reputation,” said Gary Steele, President of Go-to-Market, Cisco & GM, Splunk. “How an organisation reacts, adapts and evolves to disruption is what sets it apart as a leader. A foundational building block for a resilient enterprise is a unified approach to security and observability to quickly detect and fix problems across their entire digital footprint.” Resilience Leaders Bounce Back Faster Resilience leaders, or companies that recover faster from downtime, share common traits and strategies that provide a blueprint for digital resilience. They also invest more strategically, rather than simply investing more. The resilience leaders’ common strategies and traits include: Investing in both security and observability. Compared to other respondents, resilience leaders spend $12M more on cybersecurity tools and $2.4M more on observability tools. Embracing the benefits of GenAI. Resilience leaders are also more mature in their adoption of generative AI, expanding their use of embedded generative AI features in existing tools at four times the rate, compared to the remaining respondents. Recovering more quickly. Faster recovery often equates to a better customer experience and less unwanted media attention. Resilience leaders’ mean time to recover (MTTR) from application or infrastructure-related downtime is 28 percent faster than the majority of respondents, and 23 percent faster from cybersecurity-related incidents. Experiencing less toll from hidden costs. Most resilience leaders experience no damage from hidden costs, or describe it as “moderate.” That is in stark contrast with the remaining 90 percent of organisations that call hidden cost impacts “moderately” or “very” damaging. Dodging financial damage. Resilience leaders reduce revenue loss by $17M, lower the financial impact of regulatory fines by $10M and cut down ransomware payouts by $7M.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Interview “Modern school bus tracking systems are equipped with a range of features that make them more secure, efficient, and reliable than traditional tracking systems” – Sameer Mahapatra, Country Manager-India and SAARC, Aeris Communications May 23, 2023 technuter 0 Comments What role has IoT played in enhancing school bus tracking system in India? As per National Crime Records Bureau, 22,442 persons, including school children lost their lives in bus accidents in India from 2018-2021. As the number of accidents and incidents of crime has risen, parents have become increasingly concerned about the safety of their children while they are being transported to and from school. This heightened level of anxiety is due to the potential dangers and security threats that their children may encounter during their commute. Concerning the school students’ safety, the Transport Department of the Government of India has made installation of bus trackers mandatory for newly registered vehicles. The Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI) has mandated that all public and private school buses have an AIS 140 authorized GPS gadget with panic buttons. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Due to these safety concerns, schools are increasingly adopting transportation system technologies to enhance their capabilities. This led to emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) that ensures complete visibility of school buses. While traditional GPS-based data confirms the location and movement of the bus, IoT empowers the system by tracking the attendance and location of students. This IoT-based system enables both school administration and parents to track safety and conditions inside the school bus in real-time. It makes the traditional tracking system more efficient, secure, and reliable. By combining GPS, GMS, and RFID technologies, the modern school bus tracking system provides greater transparency in operations. Share in detail about the features that are embedded in a modern school bus tracking system. Modern school bus tracking systems are equipped with a range of features that make them more secure, efficient, and reliable than traditional tracking systems. Some of the key features of a modern school bus tracking system are: GPS Tracking: A modern school bus tracking system relies on GPS technology to track the location, speed, and movement of the school bus in real-time. This allows parents and school administrators to track the bus’s exact location and get real-time updates on the bus’s movement and estimated time of arrival. RFID-based Attendance Tracking (Radio Frequency Identification): Many modern school bus tracking systems are equipped with RFID technology that enables automatic attendance tracking of students boarding and alighting from the bus. This feature helps parents and school authorities to keep track of the student’s attendance and ensure their safety. Panic Button: A panic button is an essential safety feature in modern school bus tracking systems. Students can press the panic button in case of an emergency, and it sends an alert to the school authorities and parents with the bus location, enabling them to take immediate action. Smart Notifications: Modern school bus tracking systems send smart notifications to parents, informing them about the bus’s arrival and departure time, and any delays or deviations in the bus route. It also sends notifications when the bus is about to reach the designated stop, making it convenient for parents to plan their schedule accordingly. Geo-fencing: Geo-fencing is a virtual boundary that can be created around the school bus route using GPS technology. Any deviation from this pre-defined route triggers an alert to the school authorities and parents, enabling them to take corrective action. Live Video Monitoring: Some modern school bus tracking systems come equipped with live video monitoring features that allow school authorities and parents to monitor the students’ behavior and safety in real-time. Driver Behavior Monitoring : Modern school bus tracking systems can monitor the driver’s behavior, including driving speed, route adherence, and harsh braking or acceleration. This feature enables school authorities to ensure that drivers follow all safety protocols and drive responsibly. These features not only provide complete visibility and control over student safety during school transportation but also enable school authorities and parents to take corrective action in case of any emergency or deviation from the pre-defined route. What are the Challenges of IoT application in public transportation? While IoT has brought significant advancements in public transportation systems, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the major challenges is the issue of data privacy and security. With the collection of sensitive information such as passenger location and behavior, there is a potential risk of this data being accessed by unauthorized parties, leading to privacy breaches and cyber-attacks. The implementation of IoT systems also requires significant expertise and technical knowledge, which may be a challenge for some transportation agencies. Moreover, these systems require a reliable internet connection, and in remote areas with limited network coverage, the systems may not function optimally. There is also the challenge of interoperability and standardization. With the deployment of IoT systems by different vendors, there is a lack of standardization in the protocols and communication mechanisms used by these devices, which can make it challenging to integrate the systems with existing infrastructure. The adoption of industry-wide standards and protocols can help address this challenge and ensure seamless integration of IoT systems in public transportation. Despite the above challenges the advantages of IoT outweigh the risks and IoT for school bus monitoring is growing rapidly. How does Aeris’ School Bus Management Platform help in transforming the mobility space in India?

    "article_content": "Breaking News Interview “Increased adoption of open-source technology will continue to enhance existing open-source software” – Athitya Kumar, Senior Software Engineer at Intuit May 24, 2023 May 23, 2023 technuter 0 Comments How does Intuit strengthen a platform of culture and collaboration in innovation throughout the organization? At Intuit, our principles of Customer-Driven-Innovation (CDI) and Design-for-Delight (D4D) have helped us nurture the culture of innovation for several decades. While these principles provide clarity and guidelines, the passion every employee has for delivering unparalleled customer experiences is the key towards consistently building a highly collaborative organizational culture. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); To scale a collaborative culture to 17K+ employees globally also requires organizational structure and commitments. At Intuit, we have a very successful trend of passionate employees leaning forward and establishing tech-communities to engage like-minded individuals and drive impactful outcomes for our customers and employees. Open-source is one such tech-community where technologists contribute towards building a strong mindset and skill set in the organization towards open-source technologies and best practices. Several programs are driven by this community including project identification for opensouring, educating on the process and technical how-tos for the first timers, spreading awareness on the benefits of open sourcing among other events. Hacktoberfest is one such event that is held every year during October globally across all Intuit sites. Not just the seasoned developers, but even the college graduates who are in the first year of their careers enthusiastically participate and contribute to this month-long effort of contributing to an open-source project of their choice. Experts also lend their hand in mentoring the first-timers during such events enabling the organization to build on our learn-teach-learn culture. The contributors take away exciting rewards and are also recognized company-wide. Apart from this, Intuit also has a week-long event called Global Engineering Days (GED) which is an opportunity for technologists to use their voice and feel empowered to lead, contribute and solve big customer problems. During this time, technologists get to focus solely on areas of passion – a bug they are eager to fix, a feature they’ve wanted to add, a tool we need to integrate, a flow that needs fixing. Typically, engineers leverage GED for creating/improving any of their OSS projects, coming up with new ideas and implementing it, or just enhancing their technical prowess by exploring new technologies. We have the next GED coming up in May 2023, and we’re really excited to see the amount of innovation that comes out of it! How can organisations successfully adopt an open-source mindset collaboratively? Transforming an organization towards open-source culture is a humongous task. It could also be a delight if we have clarity on the benefit to customers and the employees. We take pride in helping our employees understand what’s in it for them and our customers by adopting open-sourcing. On the customer front, speed to deliver customer benefit is significantly fueled by emphasizing re-usability of all capabilities. We are a capability-driven company where every team builds capabilities that provide customer benefit. On the employee front, capabilities that are aligned with open-source principles also offer flexibility for employees across the organization to contribute towards building newer functionalities that can be scaled to multiple product offerings at speed. At Intuit, these mindsets are tightly coupled with architectural principles and leadership sponsorship to ensure a high say/do ratio. Capability definition and ownership helps us deliver customer benefit at speed as we emphasize re-use and avoid clones. We have guidelines on incorporating open-source principles while building these capabilities. We call it “inner-sourcing”. There are defined principles, goals and measures on how each of our capabilities are incorporating inner-sourcing guidelines. Building self-serve APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with appropriate Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Unit/Integration test coverage, documentation etc are just a few examples of how a capability can be ready for contributions from the rest of the organization. As employees mature in building and contributing to the inner-source enabled capabilities, we have witnessed significant interest and passion towards open sourcing a few of these capabilities to extend the benefit to industry as a whole. What challenges do organizations face in leveraging open-source technology among teams and individuals? The first challenge in leveraging an open-source technology is to explore the OSS project for their specific use-case, through a Proof of Concept (POC). This involves understanding the current state of implementation & basic checks on whether the, OSS projects have good documentation, user guides & contribution guidelines for different personas to get started with the project – however, evaluating the POC for the specific problem statement is still the onus of the respective organization. Once the POC is successful, the next challenge comes in the form of scale. The scale handled currently by the OSS project might be way different from the scale expected by the enterprises for their specific use cases, which results in enterprises tweaking their architecture while adopting the OSS project (or) for the OSS project to scale up at a speed that works for their customers. With POC evaluations & scale figured out, the third challenge comes in the form of adoption & integration with the internal/enterprise tool ecosystem already being used by the organization. This means that teams have to write code, which is custom to their enterprise – to integrate the OSS project & the internal tools. Finally, once enterprises have adopted the OSS project, the last challenge comes in the form of run-the-business (RTBs). This could involve requiring dedicated/expedited support – for functional logic bugs, security defects, etc. But the great opportunity in most of these challenges is that these challenges have to be solved centrally in just one place, and anyone from the open source community can contribute these patches to the OSS project! Tell us in detail about the open-source innovation projects currently at Intuit and the efforts put in to accelerate their success. One of the landmark examples of successful open-source projects at Intuit is Argo. Argo was born to enable scale with developing and running applications in the public cloud. At Intuit, we have widely adopted the Kubernetes-native workflow engine to run complex workflows which quickly grew as Intuit built Argo and the different projects within Argo , including Argo CD, Argo Rollouts, Argo Events & Argo Workflows, etc. We have our platform on top of Kubernetes called IKS (Intuit Kubernetes Services). Through IKS, Argo CD & Argo Rollouts have now become the backbone for any microservice deployment strategy at Intuit. Another success story that showcases what to expect in the future is the Argo Events & Workflows. The Batch Processing Platform (BPP) at Intuit handles scheduling, orchestration & runtimes for all Big Data jobs. Internally, BPP leverages Argo Events & Workflows to provide the scheduling & orchestration capabilities. We’re looking to onboard and adopt all of Intuit’s scheduled jobs onto BPP and scale up the Argo Workflow usage by at least 17x growth at Intuit in the upcoming 1-2 years. At Intuit, we’re actively scouting for potential open-source projects within each business unit to see what can be a shared solution that works for folks outside Intuit. So far in 2023, we’ve already open-sourced the Spring Pulsar client & Apollo mock HTTP projects from Intuit India! What are some Open-Source technology trends that can play a critical role in organizations in 2023? Increased adoption of open-source technology will continue to enhance existing open-source software. As enterprises continue to use Kubernetes and other container orchestration platforms, we expect them to run into issues that were not solved earlier, resulting in new and innovative solutions that will eventually be open-sourced. From a security point of view, we expect enterprises to enhance their screening of open-source software used to avoid vulnerabilities like log4shell, which in turn would make the existing open-source software solutions more secure. Regarding hosting, we expect innovations around API acceleration and edge computing to reduce API latency. Service Mesh providers like ISTIO have simplified their offerings by moving to a shared node agent (Ambient Mesh) instead of injected proxy containers, which opens up huge savings in hosting costs. From a programming point of view, we expect an increase in open-source contributions around programmable proxies like Envoy. We can use WebAssembly (WASM) to inject filters at runtime into Envoy proxy and also Envoy-based Service Mesh solutions like ISTIO . We also expect enterprises to continue exploring solutions around HTTP3. With the release of ChatGPT in Nov 2022, we see a lot of interest in generative AI. We expect much more open-source work related to Chatbots and overall increased adoption of ChatGPT to solve problems in software development. Considering the upcoming GenZ batch of new graduates who’re more aware & passionate about open-source, it’s going to be a no-brainer for companies to be more open-source savvy & build a good tech reputation to attract & hire awesome candidates!

    "article_content": "Breaking News Interview “Remote organizations must prioritize security measures to mitigate potential risks and safeguard sensitive information” – Christopher McNamara, Chief Revenue Officer, Remote July 14, 2023 July 13, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Please emphasize the role distributed workforce plays in today’s age of remote work. As technology continues to advance and global connectivity improves, organizations are realizing the benefits of having a workforce that is distributed across different locations, rather than being confined to a centralized physical office. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); This approach, which is becoming popular in today’s age of remote work, means that organizations can tap into a vast pool of talent from around the world. Geographical barriers are no longer a constraint, allowing companies to hire the best individuals regardless of their location. This opens up opportunities for diverse perspectives, expertise, and specialized skills that may not be readily available in a single location. A recent survey sponsored by Remote found that in the Asia Pacific region, nearly half of companies plan to hire 20-30% of their remote workforce (including employees and contractors) from other countries over the next 12-18 months. Distributed workforces play a pivotal role in today’s world of work. They enable organizations to access top talent, enhance flexibility and productivity, reduce costs, ensure business continuity, promote sustainability, boost employee satisfaction, and embrace global perspectives. As the modern work landscape continues to evolve, embracing the distributed workforce model can provide organizations with a competitive advantage and pave the way for future success. What are the advantages of adopting a distributed workforce? Embracing a distributed workforce allows companies to tap into a diverse and extensive talent pool. Instead of being limited to a specific geographical area, organizations can hire the best talent from around the world. Access a larger and more diverse talent pool to find specialized talent for hard-to-fill roles. Reduce your operational costs, as you can save on office rent, utilities, equipment, and travel expenses. You can also optimize your payroll and tax compliance by using an employer of record service like Remote. Boost your productivity and performance, as you can offer your employees more flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. You can also leverage different time zones and skills to deliver faster and better results to your customers. Enhance your culture and engagement, as you can foster a sense of trust, collaboration, and belonging among your remote employees. You can also create a more inclusive and diverse environment that values different perspectives and backgrounds. While working remotely, how do remote organizations deal with security concerns? Working remotely is here to stay. In reality, according to McKinsey, nearly 90% of people take advantage of opportunities to work flexibly. The security hazards associated with remote employment are numerous, though. Businesses must be mindful of the danger of becoming victims to cybercriminals who are leveraging the trend to spread malware, forge user credentials, and steal data from unprepared networks. Remote organizations must prioritize security measures to mitigate potential risks and safeguard sensitive information. Here are some key strategies and practices for addressing security concerns while working remotely: Strong authentication and access controls: Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to ensure secure access to company resources and systems. Enforce strong password policies and regularly educate employees on best practices for creating and managing secure passwords. Employ access controls to limit access to sensitive data and systems based on the principle of least privilege. Secure remote connections: Encourage the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) to encrypt internet connections and provide secure access to company networks and systems. VPNs create a secure tunnel for data transmission, protecting it from unauthorized interception. Endpoint security: Remote workers’ devices should have up-to-date security software, including antivirus and anti-malware solutions. Regularly patch and update operating systems, applications, and firmware to address security vulnerabilities. Data protection and encryption: Emphasize the importance of data protection by encrypting sensitive information both in transit and at rest. Utilize encryption technologies for email communications, file storage, and collaboration platforms. Encourage the use of secure file sharing services that provide end-to-end encryption. By implementing these security measures and fostering a culture of security awareness, remote organizations can effectively address security concerns and minimize the risks associated with remote work. Regular evaluation, testing, and adaptation of security measures are also crucial to ensure ongoing protection in an ever-changing threat landscape. What are the most consequential issues that an employer should consider when determining its post-covid-19 remote work policies? In recent years, there has been a growing demand among employees for greater flexibility in their work arrangements. This desire for flexibility can stem from various factors, including work-life balance, commuting concerns, personal obligations, or even individual productivity preferences. Some employees may prefer to work remotely full-time, while others may seek a combination of remote and on-site work. By accommodating flexible work arrangements, employers can benefit from increased employee satisfaction, improved retention rates, and access to a wider talent pool. Remote work policies are no longer solely within the purview of human resources departments. They have evolved into strategic considerations that impact multiple facets of an organization . Recognizing this shift is crucial for employers. Here are some key areas where remote work policies extend beyond HR: Technology and Infrastructure: Implementing remote work policies requires robust technological infrastructure and support systems. IT departments play a crucial role in ensuring employees have access to secure networks, remote collaboration tools, and reliable communication platforms. Operational Considerations: Companies need to adapt their procedures to accommodate remote work, including task allocation, project management, and team coordination. Management and Leadership: Managers need to be skilled in remote team management, establishing effective communication channels, tracking progress, providing feedback, and fostering team cohesion. Companies that offer remote work options are more likely to attract and retain top performers. Embracing remote work also enables individuals with physical disabilities, caregivers, and those who live far beyond the commuting distance of the office to join the team. By recognizing that remote work policies extend beyond HR, organizations can take a holistic approach to create a supportive and flexible work environment that meets both employee needs and business objectives. This requires collaboration across various departments and a thorough understanding of the operational, technological, cultural, and legal implications of remote work. Is there a threshold to determine when working remotely (from home or otherwise) requires local rules to apply? Whether the work is done remotely or not, employers must always remain compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, such as rules about work hours, holidays, sick time, and more. If the remote work is being done across borders, then there are significantly more considerations that must be taken into account. These include the employment laws and regulations in both the employer’s jurisdiction and the jurisdiction where the remote employee is based; tax implications for both employer and employee; and ensuring the employee has the legal right to work in the country where they are located. Companies can manage these risks and costs by working with an Employer of Record (EOR), who are set up to help businesses employ people internationally. Do you anticipate a rising trend of employers hiring remote workers as opposed to managing office-based employees who subsequently go remote? The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the acceptance and normalization of remote work. Many organizations that had previously been hesitant to embrace remote work were forced to adopt it as a necessity. Now, more and more companies, which are fully remote like ours, are choosing not to open offices and to go remote-first from the outset. Opting for a fully remote workforce right from the start gives a company the ability to achieve the full benefits of distributed work from the start, rather than achieving only partial benefits or needing to transition at a later point. They can tap into the global talent pool and hire without geographical constraints right from the beginning of their company and accelerate its growth even faster. Building a strong sense of team and fostering employee engagement is crucial when managing remote workers. Employers should invest in virtual team-building activities, online social interactions, and opportunities for remote employees to connect and collaborate. This also enables the company to establish an intentional, inclusive global culture where remote work is not just a temporary or secondary option but is deeply ingrained in the company’s culture, operations, and workflows from the very beginning. What practical issues should employers bear in mind when considering remote hiring? When considering remote hiring, employers should be mindful of several practical issues to ensure success. Here are some key considerations: Legal and compliance: Employers should be aware of all the legal and compliance requirements. This includes understanding the employment laws, tax regulations, benefits, and data privacy laws in the remote worker’s location. Time zone and communication challenges: If you are hiring a team that spans different time zones, employers need to consider how to facilitate effective communication and address potential challenges arising from time zone differences. Working asynchronouslyis one of the most effective ways to operate in a remote environment. Onboarding and training: Remote onboarding and training processes should be well-structured and tailored to remote employees. Employers need to establish effective methods for virtual onboarding, providing remote-specific training materials, and ensuring new hires feel connected and supported. Performance management and accountability: Establishing clear performance metrics, goals, and expectations is crucial for remote workers. Employers should have mechanisms in place to measure and evaluate remote employees’ performance, including regular check-ins, feedback sessions, and performance reviews. Team culture, collaboration and cohesion: Building a sense of teamwork and cohesion among remote employees is important. Employers should foster opportunities for social interaction and utilize collaboration tools to facilitate effective remote collaboration and engagement. Employee well-being and support: Remote employees may face unique challenges related to work-life balance, isolation, and burnout. Employers should prioritize employee well-being, offering resources for mental health support, promoting work-life balance, and fostering a supportive and inclusive remote work culture. Cultural and diversity considerations: Remote hiring allows employers to access talent from different cultures and backgrounds. Employers should be mindful of cultural differences, adapt their communication styles, and foster an inclusive work environment that values diversity. By addressing these practical issues, employers can create a conducive environment for remote workers and set them up for success. It is important to continuously evaluate and refine remote work practices based on feedback, lessons learned, and evolving needs to optimize the remote hiring experience.

    "article_content": "Interview “Generative AI tools can help significantly optimize marketing campaigns and provide a competitive edge in today’s dynamic business landscape” – Mr. Gyanendra N Pati, Global Head of Marketing and Communications at Acuity Knowledge Partners August 1, 2023 technuter 0 Comments In a competitive market, how do you position yourself as a key differentiator when it comes to marketing strategies? A perpetually competitive market and volatile macro environment is presenting significant challenges in front of marketers to deliver incremental value on the marketing spend. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Carefully crafted marketing strategies play a significant role in creating and maintaining brand leadership, drive growth and business expansion goals, execute thoughtful PR and Communications programs, help meaningfully amplify key initiatives such as CSR and DEI, and supports hiring and recruitment marketing plans. Therefore, marketing and brand communications strategies must be systematically aligned to these corporate objectives and these strategies should be aided by required technology and tools for efficient execution and systematic measurement. At Acuity, the Marketing and Communications team has created a unique position as a value creator and growth driver for the business. Our marketing strategies are tuned to help various business lines grow in our addressable markets. We play a pivotal role in active client acquisition and help expand into new markets and newer customer segments. Systematic and disciplined execution of these strategies has helped us contribute over 15% of total new sales annually and we consistently deliver the highest number of new logos to the business year after year. Not just sporadic growth, we are acutely focused on maximizing customer lifetime value and maximizing ROI on marketing investments, year after year. Beyond growth objectives, our marcom strategies have helped Acuity create a strong brand identity and visibility as the world’s leading provider of tech-enabled be-spoke research and analytics solutions provider to the global financial services industry. Our thought leadership and content marketing strategies, which is an integral part of the overall marketing priorities, have helped us establish our rich domain expertise and engage with senior decision makers, effectively. We have grew exponentially over these years, and we did that in a responsible manner by giving back to the society where we operate and by focusing on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs across our locations. Marketing continues to play a significant role in expanding our DEI ecosystem, amplifying our corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and translated our employee volunteering programs into meaningful storytelling helping Acuity to become a truly respected brand and a great place to work. Role of tech in Marketing – What is the future of Generative AI in Marketing? From a CMO’s point of view, tech is not just an enabler, it works as an accelerator to generate greater value for marketing and at the same time elevates customer’s overall experience of the brand. Along those lines, Generative AI has the potential to further compliment key CMO priorities – which is value creation and customer delight. I will specifically highlight five areas which will see significant adoption and impact of Generative AI in marketing. One, Personalization – with various AI models and tools, marketers can create hyper-personalized and engaging content. Growth marketers can expect greater campaign efficiency, boost productivity of demand generation campaigns and execute highly targeted and effective campaigns across channels such as email campaigns, social media posts, or even product recommendations on e-commerce platforms. Second, Segmentation – marketers can now get better at predicting consumer behavior and read customer preferences more accurately, leading to better customer segmentation and tailored advertising strategies. Hyper-targeted advertising can be used to target ads to specific groups of people based on their interests, demographics, and even past purchase behavior. Third is Creativity – in a world where UX is already playing a decisive role in consumer buying behavior, we are already seeing tons of evidence of the magic generative AI can create using simple prompts and these were previously unimaginable. AI can create compelling visuals, videos, and written content. With the power of AI, we expect lower human dependency and minimal interventions which significantly saves time and resources. This could help businesses to create more engaging and visually appealing marketing materials. Fourth, Campaign efficiency – Generative AI can automate many campaigns related tasks such as creating content, keywords, and audience, identifying target accounts, suggesting demographics, and generating reports. Last yet important, I will talk about Chatbots which is already seeing heightened adoptions across industries and customer segments. With well trained models, companies are already seeing the AI powered chatbots delivering outstanding personalized experiences, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention with tasks such as customer service, and product recommendations. Discuss the importance of using Generative AI in organizations to optimize marketing campaigns? Generative AI tools can help significantly optimize marketing campaigns and provide a competitive edge in today’s dynamic business landscape. Let’s look at some of the finer details. Generative AI can create compelling ad copies by analyzing past successful ads and identifying patterns that resonate with the target audience. This helps marketers generate engaging and relevant title and description of ad copies, that drives higher conversions. The value generated by Large Language Models and AI in audience targeting is even greater. It is particularly beneficial for marketers pointedly leaning on LinkedIn ads where the job titles, seniority levels and types of companies that needs to be targeted are suggested based on the advertiser’s product. AI has the capabilities to make the targeting process nimbler by analyzing the product and helps identify the most relevant audience segments. For those who are great fans of Google ad platform and Amazon-sponsored ads, AI tools can materially add value to the campaign teams with suggested keywords for target search terms for a given product or service. Those who know how campaigns technically work, Generative AI tools are significantly handy to suggest negative keywords to prevent irrelevant clicks and improve ad relevance and campaign efficiency. I want to touch a little on the additional fire power Large Language model bring on to the table for Content Creation that help build brand, attract customers, create superlative selling propositions and not to miss, help brand tell a great story. Marketers can smartly and creatively use Large Language Models and Generative AI to automate the content generation process, producing a wide range of visuals and video assets quickly, which is helpful content for a wide range of digital and social media platforms. What are the challenges marketers face while using AI? While AI and Large Language Models presents numerous benefits for marketers, it also comes with its fair share of challenges. To put things in perspective, AI models heavily rely on data for training and accurate predictions. Insufficient or poor-quality data can lead to biased results and inaccurate insights, hampering the effectiveness of AI-driven campaigns. Therefore, marketers must be prudent about the data quality and quantity they are feeding to the model. While data privacy and information security are already a perpetual focus for marketers; AI has taken the focus on data privacy and security to a whole new level. Marketers and allied teams handling vast amounts of customer data raises privacy and security concerns. Marketers must be even more vigilant and mindful as they navigate strict regulations and ensure data protection policies and infrastructure are in the right place to maintain consumer trust. Then comes Interpretability and Explainability challenges. Complex AI models like deep learning can be difficult to interpret, making it challenging for marketers to explain the reasoning behind AI-generated recommendations to stakeholders. Not everyone’s cup of tea, I suppose. The last one I will probably mention is on the Domain Expertise of AI models. Large language models and AI tools may not be fully ready to understand the nuances of specific industries, markets, and customer segments. Human expertise and interventions are critically essential for contextual understanding and refining AI-driven strategies. We acknowledge the current challenges, but AI is rapidly evolving. As Generative Technology matures and begin to address questions around explainability, privacy, security, ethics, and their propensity for ‘hallucinations’. As we move ahead, I am optimistic that they will become a key tool in supporting Marketers generate even greater business value and outcomes. Briefly share Acuity’s key engagement strategies to connect with the audience. We run various integrated marketing programs to connect with our audience. We leverage both online/digital and off-line channels. We have an engaging website which is central to our digital presence. We focus on producing best-in-class client focused thought leadership content such as topical blogs, whitepapers, surveys and trend reports, podcasts, newsletters, videos, and other content assets.

Physical and in-person third party events are back in relevance since late 2022. These events, albeit expensive are a great platform to demonstrate thought leadership and meet and interact with potential customers and clients. For recruitment marketing, employer branding and alumni programs, we create distinct and differentiated content then that of customer focused content and the choice of digital and social media channels varies too. For example, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are apt for recruitment marketing. What are the planned marketing initiatives of Acuity Knowledge Partners for 2023-24? For 2023-24, we will continue to focus on customer-centric, solution focused and geographically aligned marketing strategy and go-to-market programs. Considering Acuity is still a young brand, we will continue to focus on building the brand globally and regionally.

From self-managed private clouds to fully-managed public clouds, EDB delivers customers the most complete and robust Postgres solutions in the industry. Postgres is known for its performance and developer-friendly features. How does EDB enhance and optimize the Postgres experience for enterprise-level clients? Developers pick Postgres more than any other database for its technical superiority compared to legacy and proprietary systems. EDB delivers our customers the most complete and robust Postgres solutions in the industry, from Postgres in self-managed private clouds to fully-managed public clouds. This has resulted in Postgres becoming the most prolifically deployed database in modern data architectures. EDB is uniquely positioned to address the complex needs of enterprise-grade workloads, delivering distributed Postgres, unmatched Oracle compatibility, extreme high availability, and support for multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments – all with support from the company that knows Postgres better than any other. EDB’s commitment to training and education also empowers enterprise teams to effectively leverage Postgres capabilities. Through collaboration with enterprises and tailored solutions, EDB solidifies Postgres as a compelling choice for businesses seeking a powerful, reliable, and adaptable open source database solution. With many database options available in the market, what are the unique advantages that Postgres, along with EDB’s solutions and services, offers to businesses? Postgres is the database for enterprise applications. Purpose built for general use, Postgres powers enterprises across a wider variety and broader spectrum of applications than any other database, making it the economic game changer for data. There will always be specialty applications that require specialty databases. But for an enterprise standard, developers and IT executives rely on Postgres for the widest range of support. With EDB, the power of Postgres is significantly enhanced to deliver unmatched flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. Our capabilities in Oracle compatibility, distributed Postgres and support for multi cloud and hybrid cloud environments are true differentiators, contributing to EDB’s growth as a top-4 fastest growing DBMS vendor, according to Gartner. We have the largest concentration of Postgres technologists and developers and are uniquely positioned to support the complex data demands of mission-critical applications. More than a vendor, we are an indispensable business partner for our customers.

EDB also has a dominant workforce to support the local needs that spread across the product engineering, support and professional services based out of India. With more than 300 dedicated developers, and more than 30 percent of Postgres code contributions, EDB is one of the major contributors to Postgres in this open source technology. One real-world use case where EDB’s solutions helped companies improve their database management and operations is, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, a private life insurance company in India that provides insurance products for investment planning and financial security. The Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance was having issues with their legacy core insurance platform system due to it limiting the deployment of new capabilities and services and the rising support and licensing costs had become untenable. The company needed a new system that was built on a modern, open platform and that would not compromise on performance. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance deployed EDB Postgres Advanced, our enterprise class PostgreSQL offering, with operational support. We worked with our partner Chemtrols Infotech to create the design needed to meet the performance and business requirements of the organization and assisted with its deployment. As a result, The Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance had a seamless transition with no service interruption and their customers were not even aware of the major upgrade. After this transition, PostgreSQL effortlessly handled both regular loads and seasonal periods of higher transactions and the higher performance made it possible to deliver key business statistics in real time and support data driven decisions for the company. This change also significantly reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) with no compromise in database performance. Open-source technologies can sometimes raise concerns about support and security. How does EDB address these concerns for its clients while working with an open-source database like Postgres? EDB is the first company to deliver Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for Postgres with Oracle compatibility as well as flexible deployment and unmatched management and support for enterprises. TDE acts as a powerful enhancement for cloud storage security, as it encrypts data at the database level. This approach empowers database administrators (DBAs) with control and authority over data access while thwarting unauthorized entry. EDB’s comprehensive solutions assist organizations in establishing resilient architectures that effectively mitigate threats and substantially diminish the risk of security breaches. This significance is underscored by Gartner’s 2023 CIO and Technology Executive Agenda, which highlights that information security remains a top concern for IT decision-makers. The Postgres community is dynamic and rapidly growing. As one of the top contributors, how does EDB foster collaboration and innovation within this community? As one of the major contributors to Postgres in this open-source technology, EDB employs several strategies to foster collaboration and fuel innovation within this ecosystem. EDB actively engages in open and transparent communication with the broader community. By sharing insights, knowledge, and expertise, EDB encourages open dialogue and the exchange of ideas among community members. EDB contributes code, enhancements, and bug fixes to Postgres source code. These contributions not only improve the overall quality of the software but also demonstrate EDB’s commitment to advancing the community’s collective goals. A few of the projects that we have recently contributed to include: pgAdmin, Barman, repmgr, and pgBouncer. One of our most exciting developments in PostgreSQL 15 was introducing the MERGE command in 2022, which makes it easier for enterprises to migrate from expensive, legacy databases to open source. We also improved database security features, enhanced backup and recovery options and advanced logical replication capabilities. EDB has always worked closely with the Postgres community and continued to do so in this upgrade. Can you discuss the role of EDB in terms of providing training, support, and resources for organizations looking to adopt Postgres as their primary database solution? Recently, EDB began offering all of our -on-demand training resources for free. As of spring of 2023, EDB has trained more than 30,000 Postgres users and has helped more than 2,500 become Postgres certified and was ranked one of the best Postgres certification programs by Datamation.

EDB offers comprehensive training and documentation to empower customers with the knowledge and skills required to optimize their experience with the new database system. By combining robust migration tools, meticulous planning, expert guidance, and ongoing support, EDB strives to make the migration process as efficient and painless as possible for its customers. How does EDB assist organizations in migrating from their existing database systems to PostgreSQL-based solutions seamlessly? Our business strategy, along with our Go-To-Market (GTM) approach, has been crafted to eliminate barriers for our enterprise customers. The heart of our product strategy is focused on three primary drivers: Oracle compatibility, implementing distributed Postgres, and providing expert tools and extensions for Postgres including capabilities for hybrid and multi cloud. Earlier this year, we introduced the EDB Guaranteed Postgres Migration Program, which presents a risk-free pathway for companies to transition from Oracle to Postgres. This shift not only offers potential savings of up to 80% on software, support, and maintenance costs but also allows a seamless transformation, as we ensure that EDB Postgres mirrors the look, feel, and functionality of Oracle.

    "article_content": "Interview “The reverse supply chain software supports automated returns processing and provides real-time tracking of returned items.” – Mr. Sapan Jain, CEO, Blubirch August 28, 2023 August 31, 2023 technuter 0 Comments What is Blubirch’s reverse supply chain solution? Blubirch’s unique Returns Automation and Monetization platform (RAMP) is designed to help brands, retailers and marketplaces to automate the management of all types of product returns (i.e. sales, warranty and end of life) in an omnichannel environment. Traditionally, due to inefficient procedures, approximately 30%–40% of inventory that was returned would either achieve notably poor recuperation results or frequently find its way to landfills, thus causing harm to the environment. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Blubirch’s data-driven platform offers an efficient and sustainable solution to this problem. The platform seamlessly connects all stages of the reverse supply chain, from the point of returns initiation to the final disposition of the inventory. Its AI/ML-driven modules for grading, fraud detection and dynamic resolution helps eliminate unwarranted returns at the origin itself. Also, the item-level tracking, automated approvals and disposition allocation ensures reduced processing time and human errors, leading to reduced cost of operations, improved bottom line and enhanced compliance. The integrated liquidation module helps remarketing returned products across multiple secondary channels by leveraging data analytics and insights. This enables efficient product remarketing, ensuring that items are resold or repurposed in the most suitable markets with speedy and optimal recovery while avoiding channel conflict. How does your reverse supply chain software handle the process of returning products from customers or retailers? The platform starts by providing customers with hassle-free returns through a user-friendly interface, making it easier to initiate returns. This seamless interface enhances the customer experience and thereby the levels of customer satisfaction and builds brand loyalty. Blubirch’s solution streamlines returns processing through automation and real-time tracking.

This streamlined approach helps companies achieve faster processing time, improving productivity. The platform incorporates intelligent remarketing features, assessing the condition of returned products through inspection and grading. Blubirch’s solution makes informed decisions about the next steps for each product. Whether to resell, refurbish or dispose of the products, intelligent remarketing maximizes revenue potential and minimizes losses, ultimately enhancing the bottom line for businesses. Blubirch’s end-to-end approach ensures that all aspects of the reverse supply chain process are efficiently managed, eliminating inefficiencies. This comprehensive and integrated solution optimizes operations throughout the returns management process. By providing a customer-centric returns experience, Blubirch’s solution aims to elevate customer satisfaction. With timely updates and efficient handling of returns, customers are more likely to be satisfied with their interactions, fostering brand loyalty, positive word-of-mouth recommendations and potential repeat business. Can you describe the key features and functionalities of reverse supply chain software in managing product returns and exchanges? Reverse supply chain software provides businesses with a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing product returns and exchanges. It enables companies to initiate and manage return authorizations, automating the validation process to ensure only eligible products are accepted. Real-time tracking and visibility features offer insights into the status of returned products, enabling businesses to identify problems and improve overall efficiency. The software also includes functionality for product inspection and grading, helping determine if returned items can be resold, refurbished or disposed of. The software manages the refurbishment process for repairable items, tracking repair status and progress until products are ready for resale. The warranty management functionality automatically checks warranty coverage and enforces policies for replacements or repairs, ensuring customers receive appropriate service. Integrating with inventory management, the software maintains accuracy of stock levels for products that have been returned and replaced, preventing inventory discrepancies and stockouts. Additionally, it facilitates proper disposal of products that cannot be resold or repaired, adhering to environmental regulations. Comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities provide valuable insights into returns trends and customer behaviour, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve operations. The software integrates with other systems such as CRM, ERP, e-commerce platforms and shipping carriers, ensuring smooth workflow and scalable operations. It also addresses compliance requirements by managing industry regulations, product recalls and legal obligations related to returned items. The reverse supply chain software streamlines the returns process, promotes efficiency and enhances business customer satisfaction. Does the software support automated returns processing and provide real-time tracking of returned items? The reverse supply chain software supports automated returns processing and provides real-time tracking of returned items. It is a key feature of the software, enabling businesses to monitor returned products’ status and location throughout the reverse supply chain process. This visibility enables businesses to identify glitches, track turnaround times and make informed decisions to optimize operations. Automated returns processing involves: Automating various stages of the returns management process such as validating return requests Determining eligibility Issuing return merchandise authorizations (RMAs) Managing product inspections This automation helps streamline the returns process, reduces manual intervention and improves efficiency. How does the reverse supply chain software handle product inspection and determine whether an item can be refurbished, repaired or recycled? In the reverse supply chain, the AI/ML-based algorithms in the software conduct a thorough inspection based on predefined criteria when products are returned. This inspection assesses the condition of each returned item to determine the appropriate course of action. If the product is in relatively good condition but requires minor improvements, it is categorized as refurbishable. In such cases, the software initiates cosmetic enhancements and other necessary repairs to restore the product to a new condition. For items that need more significant repairs to become functional again, the software assigns them to repair management. It tracks the repair process, assigns tasks to repair facilities and monitors progress until the product is restored. Some returned items may be damaged beyond repair or are no longer functional. The software identifies these irreparable items for recycling or proper disposal. By doing so, the software ensures that environmentally responsible practices are followed, reducing waste and promoting sustainability. Can you elaborate on how the software ensures data security and privacy during the reverse supply chain process, especially when dealing with returned electronics or devices? The reverse supply chain software ensures data security and privacy while handling returned electronics or devices through robust measures. It employs encryption techniques to protect sensitive data during transmission and storage, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals. Stringent access controls are implemented, granting specific permissions based on user roles to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Customer privacy is safeguarded through data anonymization, removing identifiable information while allowing for operational insights. Secure data deletion mechanisms are in place to irreversibly wipe data from returned devices, preventing data leakage or unauthorized access. Secure logistics and encrypted communication channels ensure data protection during transportation. Compliance with data protection regulations and regular security audits enhance the system’s security. If a third-party is involved, risk assessments provide their adherence to strict data security and privacy standards. These measures collectively instil customer trust, minimize data breach risks and uphold legal responsibilities in data handling.

    "article_content": "Global Tech Security Kaspersky opens its first Transparency Center in the African region November 15, 2023 technuter 0 Comments As part of the Africa Cyber Defense Forum (ACDF), Kaspersky has announced the opening of its first Transparency Center in the African region. The new center, located in Kigali, Rwanda, is opening as part of Kaspersky’s Global Transparency Initiative, established to highlight the reliability of the company’s solutions and advocate for greater transparency throughout the cybersecurity industry. The new center offers its visitors a comprehensive overview of Kaspersky’s engineering and data processing practices, and a live demonstration of the source code for its products and services. Internet penetration in the African region has been steadily increasing over the years: according to the World Bank, broadband Internet access in Africa grew from 26% in 2019 to 36% in 2022. As outlined in the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy, all people in Africa should be digitally empowered by 2030, which means that digitalisation will be enhancing, bringing both opportunities and challenges. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The new Transparency Center in Kigali is available for Kaspersky’s partners, customers, and regulators responsible for cybersecurity. It is designed to serve the “blue piste” review option, which has gained significant popularity among Transparency Centers’ visitors since the opening of the first facility in 2018. It offers a general overview of Kaspersky’s engineering and data processing practices: throughout their visit, partners and customers are welcome to ask Kaspersky experts any questions related to the company’s data processing procedures and the functioning of its solutions. Additionally, as part of the “blue piste,” they can improve or acquire skills to assess the security of ICT products that their organisations use, learning the highlights of Kaspersky’s Cyber Capacity Building Program for government organisations, academia and companies. Underscoring the strong nexus between transparency and the fight against cybercrime, and Kaspersky’s commitment to both causes, the new Transparency Center opening was welcomed by the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL): “The African region is currently undergoing rapid digital transformation, with Internet penetration continually growing year on year. To counter potential security risks stemming from the use of technology, it is imperative to understand what forms an effective framework to mitigate risks. Today, as Kaspersky announces the opening of its first Transparency Center in the African region, we appreciate the company’s openness and welcome its Global Transparency Initiative, which is exemplary for organisations in the region in terms of building digital trust. Kaspersky has a proven track record of collaborating with local, regional and international law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime, sharing its technical expertise, in the spirit of transparency,” AFRIPOL’s Acting Executive Director, Ambassador Jalel Chelba, commented. With the opening of the facility in the region, Kaspersky will expand its network to encompass a total of 11 Transparency Centers located across Europe, Asia-Pacific, North and Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Introducing another milestone in the Global Transparency Initiative, Genie Sugene Gan, Head of Government Affairs and Public Policy for Asia-Pacific, Japan, Middle East, Turkey and Africa regions at Kaspersky, during her keynote speech at the ACDF, noted: “A growing emphasis on cybersecurity within the pan-regional African agenda is piquing the interest of national authorities. However, there remains a significant gap in cyber-capacity building. By opening the Transparency Center, Kaspersky aims to address the local market needs, offering education in such critical areas as evaluating product security and establishing secure development processes. The Transparency Center opening marks a pivotal advancement and a significant milestone for both our organisation and the region, as we bring essential capacity-building capabilities and best cybersecurity practices to the region.” Being a dedicated advocate for enhancing transparency in the cybersecurity industry, Kaspersky launched its Global Transparency Initiative in 2017, becoming a pioneer in advancing digital trust. The initiative reaffirms the company’s readiness to disclose how Kaspersky works, what standards it implements, how its solutions perform and why they are trustworthy. Kaspersky actively involves the broader community in validating and verifying the reliability of its products, internal processes, and overall business operations. As a significant aspect of the Global Transparency Initiative, the company leads as the first cybersecurity vendor to disclose its source code for external review.

    "article_content": "Security Numberline Security and Veeam Extend the Zero Trust Maturity Model for Improved Cyber Resilience December 1, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Veeam Software introduced Zero Trust Data Resilience (ZTDR), a model to help organizations reduce the risk of growing data security threats and improve their overall resilience. Developed in collaboration with Zero Trust expert Jason Garbis of Numberline Security, ZTDR applies Zero Trust principles to backup and recovery as an extension to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust Maturity Model. Essential to ZTDR is the separation of backup management systems and their storage tiers into distinct resilience zones to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential blast radius from breaches; and immutable backup storage, to ensure that data cannot be modified even in the event of a ransomware attack. Modern, effective security is based on Zero Trust, replacing the increasingly ineffective perimeter-based security approach. Yet most Zero Trust frameworks do not include the security of data backup and recovery systems, despite the fact backup data is often the primary target of malicious actors in both ransomware and data exfiltration attacks. The Veeam Data Protection Trends Report 2023 found 93% of ransomware attacks are targeting backup repositories. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “Backup infrastructure by its nature has a large attack surface, because it must have read and write access to production, spanning virtually all enterprise applications and data sources, both on-premises and in the cloud,” said Jason Garbis, Founder at Numberline Security. “To reduce that risk, Numberline and Veeam are proposing practical Zero Trust Data Resilience tools, including core principles, an architecture, and a maturity model. Our goal is to help organizations fill a gap in their security strategy by extending Zero Trust to backup and recovery to achieve greater cyber resilience.” Within the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, “Data” is one of five pillars, under which it identifies five key functions: Data Inventory Management, Data Categorization, Data Availability, Data Access and Data Encryption. To extend this model to the critical function of data backup and recovery, the ZTDR principles are: Least Privilege Access Immutability System Resilience Proactive Validation Operational Simplicity To help organizations begin their journey to implement these principles, Numberline has developed a detailed ZTDR Maturity Model, as well as a ZTDR Reference Architecture which includes these key attributes for improved data resilience: Segmentation, for clear separation of Backup Software and Backup Storage layers to create distinct resilience zones that minimize the attack surface and reduce the blast radius when an attack occurs. Backup storage immutability, ensuring data cannot be modified or deleted. “The latest Veeam research shows that 75% of ransomware attacks on backups are successful,” said Danny Allan, CTO at Veeam. “To keep businesses running, it’s essential to ensure data immutability and to follow best practices like Zero Trust Data Resilience (ZDTR). With the ZTDR Maturity Model, every organization can chart their path to greater data security and less down time. While Veeam has always been committed to this architectural approach, we are working with storage partners to implement an industry leading zero trust model.” “To combat escalating cyber threats like ransomware, there is a pressing need to unify and strengthen IT and security effectiveness leveraging frameworks like Zero Trust,” said Christophe Bertrand, Practice Director at ESG. “We have found in our latest ransomware state of the market research that 86% overall think Zero Trust is a key strategy for ransomware protection. Zero Trust Data Resilience is fundamental in addressing those needs to deliver a more robust security posture through faster and safer recovery.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Cloud Security Cloud Infrastructure is the Greatest Source Of Cyber Risk to Indian Businesses December 8, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Tenable has published new findings highlighting that the vast majority of Indian cybersecurity and IT leaders (70%) view cloud infrastructure as the greatest source of cyber risk in their organisation. The perceived risks stem from the use of public cloud (36%) and/or multi-cloud (23%) and private cloud infrastructure (10%). Respondents are particularly worried about the complexity introduced when trying to correlate user and system identities, access, and entitlement data. Within this context, 78% of Indian respondents emphasised the importance of considering user identity and access privileges. However, 64% say their organisations struggle to integrate this crucial data into preventive cybersecurity practices, revealing a gap between recognition and practical implementation. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); These findings are part of the Indian edition of “Old Habits Die Hard: How People, Process and Technology Challenges Are Hurting Cybersecurity Teams in India,” based on a commissioned study of 825 IT and cybersecurity professionals including 69 Indian respondents conducted in 2023 by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Tenable. The report outlines the challenges and risks associated with cloud infrastructure. As well as specific cloud security concerns, the Tenable study highlights that 57% of Indian respondents express that a lack of data hygiene in user data and vulnerability management systems prevents employees from making prioritisation decisions. Additionally, 56% of organisations spend 11 hours or more per month creating security reports for business leaders and 46% of them use multi-tabbed spreadsheets to analyse data from different solutions. While 28% hold monthly meetings on business-critical systems, 9% of organisations only meet once a year (or less), indicating a need for more consistent strategic discussions on organisational security. The study also showed that 78% of respondents allocate 25 or more employees to tasks related to deploying, supporting, maintaining, and managing vendor relationships for cybersecurity tools. This underscores the substantial human resources required for effective cybersecurity measures. Kartik Shahani, country manager at Tenable India, said, “Almost everything in the cloud is one excess privilege or misconfiguration away from exposure. The intricate cloud landscape prompts organisations to resort to various tools and point solutions to counteract these threats. Unfortunately, this approach drains resources, leading to substantial costs as they grapple with configuring and implementing disparate products. Effectively securing the cloud requires more than just technical proficiency; it demands a nuanced understanding of assets, vulnerabilities, and their alignment with overarching business objectives.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Security 77% Indians came across fake profiles/photos that looked AI-generated on dating platform and social media February 12, 2024 technuter 0 Comments McAfee unveils its second annual “Modern Love” study, about the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in online dating, and the implications this has for increased catfishing and romance scams. This study surveyed 7,000 people in seven countries worldwide, including India. The rise of powerful AI tools complicates the online dating landscape. By leveraging easy-to-use AI tools, romance scammers can craft convincing messages and realistic profile images to trick people looking for love online. The key findings of this study revealed that 77% of Indians said they’d come across fake profiles and/or photos that look AI-generated on dating websites or apps, or on social media. Further, the prevalence of romance scams emerged with 39% of Indians saying their conversations with a potential love interest online turned out to be with a scammer. 26% said they’d talked with a potential love interest, to discover it was actually an AI-generated bot and not a real person. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 91% of Indians revealed they, or someone they know, have been contacted by a stranger through social media or text message and started to “chat” with them regularly to know them better. With that in mind, those looking for love are often more vulnerable to scams when connecting with strangers, and cybercriminals use that vulnerability to their advantage by engaging in long and sophisticated attempts to steal from victims. Furthermore, the study also discovered that more than half, 65% Indians have used ChatGPT/AI to help create pics or other content for a dating app. Specifically this Valentine’s Day, 56% of Indians are planning to or considering using AI to write messages for their love interest as it helps boost their confidence. However, this contrasts sharply with people’s feelings about receiving AI-generated content: 60% of people said they would be hurt or offended if they found out their Valentine’s message was written by a machine / Artificial Intelligence. Despite mixed feelings and experiences, the effectiveness of AI is undeniable: 81% of people reported receiving more interest and better responses using AI-generated content than when they drafted or used their own original content. And if you’re not on dating apps/sites, the McAfee Labs team reveals you still need to exercise caution online with an increase in Valentine-related scams. This includes Valentine-related malware campaigns (25% surge), malicious URLs (300% increase), and a variety of romance-themed spam and email scams (a staggering 400% increase), with the majority focused on Valentine’s shopping and gifts. McAfee Labs expects these numbers will continue rising as February 14 gets closer, urging vigilance. “The possibilities of AI are endless, and unfortunately, so are the perils. For people who are shy about starting conversations, short on time to craft the perfect message, or whose photos could be brightened, AI offers tools to help enjoy all the fun and excitement that comes with online dating.,” said Steve Grobman, McAfee’s Chief Technology Officer. “Unfortunately, we know cybercriminals also use AI to scale malicious activity. With love-seekers spending more time online leading up to Valentine’s Day, scammers are using AI to pose as love interests to steal your money or personal information. We encourage people to balance romantic hope with healthy skepticism, to pause before sharing sensitive information online, and to ensure they use the right tools to protect their privacy, identity, and personal information,” continued Grobman. Steps for protecting yourself from online romance and AI scams. People can help prevent financial and emotional heartbreak by taking the following steps: Scrutinize any direct messages you receive from a love interest, via a dating app or social media. One way to spot a scammer is to watch for consistent, AI-generated messages. These are often quite generic or lack substance. Additionally, it’s important to be sure not to click on any links in messages you receive from someone you have not met in person. Do a reverse-image search of any profile pictures the person uses . If the search results show that your love interest is associated with another name or with details that don’t match up with what they’ve told you, you may be chatting with a scammer. Never send money or gifts to someone you haven’t met in person, even if they send you money first. Scammers often send money to soften up their victim and build trust, so don’t share personal or account information, even if the other person is forthcoming with theirs. Talk to someone you trust about this new love interest . It can be easy to miss things that don’t add up when you are feeling hopeful and excited. So, pay attention to your friends or family when they show signs of concern, and take the relationship slowly. Invest in tools to help identify online scams. McAfee’s portfolio of products includes innovative protection features, such as McAfee Scam Protection, that detects and protects you in real time from never-before-seen threats and scams – whether that’s dangerous links shared on text, email, search results, or social media. In addition, McAfee recently announced deepfake detection is on the horizon, furthering McAfee’s commitment to use AI to fight AI scams and help arm consumers with the ability to detect deepfakes.

    "article_content": "Bloguter Security 5 Reasons Why Smart Video Surveillance HDDs are Needed for CCTV July 26, 2023 technuter 0 Comments New cutting-edge technology and innovative solutions continue to drive the growth of the smart video CCTV industry. According to a report, the video surveillance market is projected to grow from USD 48.7 billion in 2022 to USD 76.4 billion by 2027. The market demand clearly shows a surge in the deployment of CCTVs across verticals and industries to improve the way we live and work. Today, best practices and guidelines are available to help industries like retail, manufacturing, smart cities, and more implement CCTV to effectively manage and control their operations. CCTV systems capture and record video footage continuously, which can quickly lead to large amounts of data being generated. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); As a result, it is important to use a CCTV or smart video-grade storage solution instead of standard hard disk drives (HDDs) for 24/7 monitoring. A smart video surveillance HDD, specifically designed to handle multiple streams and the demand of continuous recording provides reliable and consistent performance for the demands of a CCTV system. Here’s why smart video surveillance HDDs are needed for CCTV usage: 24×7 monitoring : Surveillance HDDs are designed to run continuously, helping ensure that the videos are consistently recorded 24/7. This can help improve operational efficiency by capturing video footage round the clock, as these HDDs allow for real-time issue detection. Any anomalies, malfunctions, or deviations from standard operating procedures can be immediately identified, triggering alerts or notifications. Surveillance HDDs such as WD Purple TM Pro feature a workload rating of up to 180TB/year – up to three times that of desktop drives, specifically designed to operate in surveillance systems, where the need is to continuously record and store large amounts of video data. Crystal clear video : Due to their fast-writing speeds, smart video surveillance HDDs allow for quick capture of multiple streams and high-capacity storage of very high-quality video. The WD Purple HDDs also feature AllFrame technology so CCTV cameras can record videos with less frame loss and produce high-quality, sharp-edged 4K videos, compared to videos stored on PC drives. Ability to process heavy workloads: Smart video surveillance HDDs are intended for 24×7 storage workloads, as they function on a 90-10 ratio– 90% storage and 10% of review and replay data. Smart video surveillance HDDs are optimized for scalability, enabling the addition of more cameras to the system. For instance, some surveillance HDDs like WD Purple drives can support up to 64 single-stream HD cameras (6TB and beyond), as well as many of the most recent cameras that send multiple streams to provide basic AI capability. Additionally, certain Western Digital drives like WD Purple Surveillance HDD (up to 10TB) are engineered for mainstream surveillance DVRs and NVRs that operate 24/7 and are able to process heavy workloads as they have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of up to 1 million hours. Sustainable solution: Smart video surveillance HDDs consume less power than traditional HDDs or general-purpose computer drives because of their low-power profiles. This helps in producing less heat, which results in cooler overall operating temperatures. Even while working 24x7x365, these HDDs can function smoothly without breaking down. Consolidated footage: Smart video surveillance HDDs offer a decent amount of storage – up to 22TB 4 . The 22TB 4 WD Purple Pro HDDs can be used to consolidate footage from multiple cameras into a central video server or storage system, which makes it easier to manage and analyze the data. For instance, surveillance HDDs such as the WD Purple Pro comes equipped with field-proven OptiNAND TM technology that delivers trusted high-capacity performance and offers storage of up to 22TB 1 for the massive storage needs of AI-driven smart video and deep learning analytics. Overall, smart video surveillance HDDs are important for CCTV systems that record continuously and require better reliability, durability, and storage capacity for 24/7 streaming. Specialised storage solutions can help handle high workloads, retain data for long periods, and consume less power, making the most out of a CCTV system.

    "article_content": "Bloguter Breaking News Modernize your cyber recovery strategy with these five simple steps October 19, 2023 technuter 0 Comments The transportation of data is a complicated task in the digital era. Business professionals will look to move data regularly as they work. However, information resides in a multitude of data centers, cloud services and edge locations – and moving data can be a complicated and expensive task. Digital leaders must lay the groundwork to ensure data is accessible in the future. They should think carefully about how to store data. They should focus on tagging data and should concentrate on storage management and protection. That way, digital leaders can be sure data is collected, backed up and accessed by the right people. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Dell Technologies Global Data Protection Index Report 2022 stated that 86% of businesses had experienced a cybersecurity incident led disruption. The report also captured that businesses would be experiencing more frequent cyber-attacks or incidents this year. To create a more cyber-resilient approach to data protection, businesses need to modernize and automate their recovery and business continuity strategies and leverage the latest intelligent tools to detect and defend against cyber threats. The current challenges in security can be mitigated through a robust Cyber Resiliency strategy. Cyber resilience requires a multi-layered approach to cybersecurity. In addition to advanced threat protection and security training for employees, a strong cyber recovery strategy can promote cyber resilience by protecting backup systems from corruption and enabling fast recovery of business-critical systems, applications, and operations after an attack. In short, Cyber Resiliency is a strategy that incorporates people, processes, and technology into a holistic framework that protects an entire business, organization, or entity. This strategy allows businesses to prepare for and recover rapidly from disruptions caused by cyberattacks. Here are five components of a proven and modern cyber recovery strategy: Automated Data Vaults Cyber resilience cannot be achieved without a major component – the Cyber Recovery Vault. It offers multiple layers of protection to provide resilience against cyberattacks even from an insider threat. It moves critical data away from the attack surface, physically isolating it within a protected part of the data center, and requires separate security credentials and multifactor authentication for access. Additional safeguards include an automated operational air gap to provide network isolation and eliminate management interfaces that could be compromised. If a ransomware or data destruction attack impacts data and applications in the main production environments, the threat actors still cannot access the contents of the data vault. Post-attack, as part of the incident response and recovery process, clean copies of data and applications stored in the data vault are used to restore the production environment. If a cyberattack occurs, we can quickly identify a clean copy of our data, recover our critical systems and get our business back up and running. Data Isolation and Governance Similarly, ensuring an isolated data center environment that is disconnected from corporate and backup networks and restricted from users other than those with proper clearance is another method for ensuring a water-tight cyber recovery strategy. By isolating critical data, identifying suspicious activity, and accelerating data recovery, enterprises can more easily achieve cyber resilience with this approach. Intelligent Analytics and Tools Additionally, machine learning and full-content indexing with powerful analytics within the safety of the vault are effective tools for detecting threats. This also includes automated integrity checks to determine whether data has been impacted by malware and tools to support remediation if needed. Recovery and Remediation If an incident has indeed taken place, remediation consists of workflows and tools that perform recovery by using dynamic restore processes and existing data recovery procedures to bring business-critical systems back online quickly and with confidence. This must also include a comprehensive methodology for protecting data, as well as performing damage assessments and forensics to provide an organization with the confident and most reliable path to recovery of business-critical systems. Solution Planning and Design Finally, expert guidance and services can help organizations determine which business-critical systems need protection and can create dependency maps for associated applications and services, as well as the infrastructure needed to recover them. For example, Zero Trust is a cybersecurity model that shifts how organizations approach security from relying solely on perimeter defenses to a proactive strategy that only allows known good activity across ecosystems and data pipelines. It allows organizations to better align their cybersecurity strategy across the data center, clouds, and at the edge. Such services also generate recovery requirements and design alternatives, while identifying the technologies to analyze, host and protect data, along with a business case and implementation timeline. Executives dealing with data must be pragmatic. Organizations and their employees will continue to use a range of platforms for security. Rather than assuming data is consolidated and constrained, businesses need to create a cyber resilience strategy that addresses a broad range of threats and barriers. Only then will data be fully utilized as the valuable resource it can and should be.

Use Additional Security Measures: Exploring additional security measures offered by credit card issuers, such as two-factor authentication, virtual credit card numbers, and mobile payment services, contributes to an enhanced defence against credit card fraud. How to report credit card fraud? In the event of suspected credit card fraud, individuals must act swiftly to mitigate potential damage. The first step involves promptly contacting the credit card issuer to report the suspected fraud and request the freezing of the affected account. Simultaneously, individuals should place a fraud alert with one of the major credit bureaus to enhance security measures and minimize the risk of further unauthorized activities. Additionally, filing a complaint with relevant law enforcement agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the local district attorney becomes essential, depending on the nature of the fraud. Regular monitoring of credit reports is advised to promptly identify any unauthorized account openings, providing an early warning system against potentially fraudulent activities. To fortify online security, it is crucial to update passwords and security settings for compromised online accounts. For an added layer of protection, individuals may consider implementing a credit freeze, which prevents unauthorized access to credit reports and can be unfrozen when necessary for legitimate transactions. By following these comprehensive steps, individuals can actively engage in the prevention and resolution of credit card fraud, safeguarding their financial well-being. Understanding the common types of credit card fraud and adopting proactive measures is crucial in safeguarding personal and financial information. In an age where digital transactions are ubiquitous, credit card fraud continues to evolve, making vigilance and preventive measures essential for protecting oneself and one’s finances. By staying informed and implementing the outlined strategies, individuals can fortify their defences against the ever-present threat of credit card fraud. Authored by:- Mr. Dhiren .V.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Apple unveils new Mac Studio and brings Apple silicon to Mac Pro June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple introduced the new Mac Studio and Mac Pro, the two most powerful Macs ever made. Mac Studio features M2 Max and the new M2 Ultra, delivering a huge boost in performance and enhanced connectivity in its stunningly compact design. Mac Studio is up to 6x faster than the most powerful Intel-based 27-inch iMac, and up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Mac Studio with M1 Ultra. Mac Pro, now featuring M2 Ultra, combines the unprecedented performance of Apple’s most powerful chip with the versatility of PCIe expansion. Mac Pro is up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Intel-based model. Featuring up to 192GB of unified memory, Mac Studio with M2 Ultra and Mac Pro have far more memory than the most advanced workstation graphics cards, taking on demanding workloads other systems can’t even process. The new Mac Pro completes the Mac transition to Apple silicon and, together with the rest of Apple’s pro systems, gives users the most powerful and capable lineup of pro products Apple has ever offered. Mac Studio and Mac Pro are available to order, with availability beginning Tuesday, June 13. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, said, “The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro with Apple silicon are the two most powerful Macs we’ve ever made. Mac Studio has been a breakthrough for pros everywhere, and it’s at the heart of hundreds of thousands of home and pro studios across the world. Today, it gets even better with M2 Max and the new M2 Ultra, featuring even more performance and enhanced connectivity. And for those users who need the versatility of internal expansion, Mac Pro combines PCIe slots with our most powerful chip. The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro join our other pro systems to give our users the most powerful and capable lineup of pro products that Apple has ever offered.” Mac Studio: A Performance Powerhouse Mac Studio empowers pros to build the studio of their dreams with its groundbreaking performance and extensive connectivity in a compact form that lives right on their desks. With M2 Max and M2 Ultra, the new Mac Studio provides a big boost in performance versus the previous generation and a massive leap for users coming from older Macs. Mac Studio with M2 Max is up to 50 percent faster than the previous-generation Mac Studio and 4x faster than the most powerful Intel-based 27-inch iMac. It features a 12-core CPU, up to a 38-core GPU, and up to 96GB of unified memory with 400GB/s of memory bandwidth. When compared to Mac Studio with M1 Max, Mac Studio with M2 Max: Empowers motion graphics designers using After Effects to render up to 50 percent faster. Enables developers to build new versions of apps with Xcode at blazing speed, with up to 25 percent faster performance. Mac Studio with M2 Ultra takes Mac performance to new heights. M2 Ultra delivers twice the performance and capabilities of M2 Max, and is Apple’s largest and most capable system on a chip (SoC) ever. Mac Studio with M2 Ultra is up to 3x faster than the previous-generation Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, and up to 6x faster than the most powerful Intel-based 27-inch iMac. It features a 24-core CPU, up to a 76-core GPU, and up to 192GB of memory with 800GB/s of unified memory bandwidth for workstation-class performance. When compared to Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, Mac Studio with M2 Ultra: Empowers 3D artists using Octane to render up to 3x faster. Enables colourists using DaVinci Resolve to see up to 50 percent faster video processing than before. Mac Studio: Enhanced Connectivity Featuring a wide array of connectivity within easy reach for pros, the new Mac Studio now has higher-bandwidth HDMI, enabling up to 8K resolution and 240Hz frame rates. With M2 Ultra, Mac Studio supports up to six Pro Display XDRs — driving over 100 million pixels — allowing for a vast amount of screen real estate for pro workflows. Additionally, it now features advanced built-in wireless technologies. Wi-Fi 6E delivers download speeds that are up to twice as fast as the previous generation, while Bluetooth 5.3 allows users to connect to the latest Bluetooth accessories. On the back, Mac Studio includes four Thunderbolt 4 ports, a 10Gb Ethernet port, an enhanced HDMI port, and two USB-A ports. It also conveniently has two USB-C ports and an SD card slot on the front to easily import photos and video. Apple Silicon Comes to Mac Pro Mac Pro delivers the groundbreaking performance of M2 Ultra, plus the versatility of PCIe expansion, taking the most demanding workflows to the next level. While the Intel-based Mac Pro started with an 8-core CPU and could be configured up from there, every Mac Pro has Apple’s most powerful 24-core CPU, an up to 76-core GPU, and starts with twice the memory and SSD storage. The new Mac Pro can also be configured with up to a massive 192GB of memory with 800GB/s of unified memory bandwidth. This is far more memory than the most advanced workstation graphics cards. Now every Mac Pro has the performance of not just one but seven Afterburner cards built in. It also features the same industry-leading media engine as Mac Studio with M2 Ultra. Both can play an unprecedented 22 streams of 8K ProRes video. When compared to the Intel-based Mac Pro, Mac Pro with M2 Ultra: Empowers demanding real-world pro workflows like video transcoding and 3D simulations to run up to 3x faster. Enables video engineers to ingest 24 4K camera feeds and encode them to ProRes in real time, all on a single machine, when using six video I/O cards. Mac Pro: The Versatility of PCIe Expansion The new Mac Pro brings PCIe expansion to Apple silicon for pros who want the performance of M2 Ultra and rely on internal expansion for their workflows. Mac Pro features seven PCle expansion slots, with six open expansion slots that support gen 4, which is 2x faster than before, so users can customise Mac Pro with essential cards. From audio pros who need digital signal processing (DSP) cards, to video pros who need serial digital interface (SDI) I/O cards for connecting to professional cameras and monitors, to users who need additional networking and storage, Mac Pro lets professionals customise and expand their systems, pushing the limits of their most demanding workflows. Mac Pro: Advanced Connectivity The wide array of connectivity in Mac Pro gets even better with eight built-in Thunderbolt 4 ports — six on the back and two on the top — which is twice as many as before. It supports up to six Pro Display XDRs, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, which come to the new Mac Pro for fast wireless connectivity. Additionally, Mac Pro includes three USB-A ports, two higher-bandwidth HDMI ports that support up to 8K resolution and up to 240Hz frame rates, two 10Gb Ethernet ports, and a headphone jack that enables the use of high-impedance headphones. Better for the Environment The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro are designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both use far less energy than the desktops in their class, and over 40 percent less than the ENERGY STAR efficiency requirement. Mac Studio and Mac Pro are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium, and over 95 percent of the packaging is fiber based. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations and is focused on its Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral. This means every Mac Apple creates, from design to manufacturing to customer use, will have net-zero climate impact. macOS: The World’s Most Advanced Desktop Operating System Designed to take full advantage of Apple silicon, Mac Studio and Mac Pro come with macOS Ventura, delivering breakthrough performance and productivity. Features like Stage Manager make focusing on tasks and moving between apps and windows easier and faster than ever, while Continuity Camera, Handoff in FaceTime, Safari passkeys, and the Freeform app help users be more productive and expressive. Powerful gaming features like MetalFX Upscaling help accelerate gameplay performance with stunning graphics and optimisations for Apple silicon, while pro apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro enable users to tackle more complex projects, all at blazing speeds. Arriving this fall, macOS Sonoma adds powerful features and productivity tools that unlock new ways to get things done on Mac. Dynamic video conferencing features, including Presenter Overlay, elevate the presence of users when showcasing their work during video calls by including them on top of the content they’re sharing. Designed to enable hybrid in-studio and remote pro workflows, macOS Sonoma brings a new high performance mode to the Screen Sharing app, which leverages the advanced media engine in Apple silicon to deliver incredibly responsive remote access, including low-latency audio, high frame rates, and support for reference colour. Users can place widgets right on the desktop, interact with them with just a click, and through the magic of Continuity, use iPhone widgets while they work. Now it’s easy to complete powerful tasks — like running Shortcuts — right from widgets on desktop. Big updates come to Safari, taking productivity on the web to the next level with profiles, which keeps browsing separate between multiple topics or projects, and web apps on Mac, which provide faster access to favourite sites. Pricing and Availability The new Mac Studio and Mac Pro are available to order on apple.com/in/store and in the Apple Store app. They will start to arrive to customers, and will be available in Apple Store locations and Apple Authorised Resellers, beginning Tuesday, June 13.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Apple Announces iOS 17 June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple announced iOS 17, a major release that upgrades the communications experience across Phone, FaceTime, and Messages; makes sharing even easier with AirDrop; and provides more intelligent input that improves the speed and accuracy of typing. iOS 17 also introduces new experiences with Journal, an app that makes it easy for people to practice gratitude, and StandBy, a new way to view glanceable information when iPhone is set down and charging. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said, “With iOS 17, we’ve made iPhone more personal and intuitive by deeply considering the features we all rely on every day. Phone, FaceTime, and Messages are central to how we communicate, and this release is packed with updates we think our users are going to love. We’ve also reimagined AirDrop with new ways to share, autocorrect gets even better, and we’re introducing all-new experiences with Journal and StandBy, plus so much more. We can’t wait for everyone to try it.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Major Upgrades to the Phone Experience The Phone app is central to the iPhone experience, and it receives a big update with personalised Contact Posters, providing a new way for users to express themselves. Users can customise how they appear, bringing a completely new look to incoming calls, and choose beautiful treatments for photos or Memoji, as well as eye-catching typography and font colors. Contact Posters will also be available for third-party calling apps. Live Voicemail gives users the ability to see real-time transcription as someone leaves a voicemail, and the opportunity to pick up while the caller is leaving their message. Calls identified as spam by carriers won’t appear as Live Voicemail, and will instead be instantly declined. With the power of the Neural Engine, Live Voicemail transcription is handled on-device and remains entirely private. FaceTime Adds Audio and Video Messages, Reactions, and Extends to Apple TV FaceTime now supports audio and video messages so when users call someone who is not available, they can share a message that can be enjoyed later. FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video calling apps can take advantage of them as well. In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPhone and then hand it off to Apple TV, to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room. A Fresh Look and Big Updates to Messages Messages gets significant updates with iOS 17, including an all-new stickers experience with new emoji stickers and the ability to create Live Stickers by lifting subjects from photos. Users can also add effects to Live Stickers that bring them to life, and a new drawer in the keyboard puts all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iOS. New Messages features enhance the way users communicate. An expandable menu that can be accessed with a simple tap to display iMessage apps gives Messages a sleeker look. Search gets more powerful and precise with search filters, making it possible for users to start a search and add additional filters to narrow down the results and find exactly what they are seeking. A new catch-up arrow indicates where the user last left off in the conversation, and replying inline is as simple as swiping on a text bubble. If a user shares their location, it will update in real time right in the conversation. When sending an audio message, it’s transcribed automatically so users can read it in the moment or listen later. Messages also introduces Check In, an important feature for when a user wants to notify a family member or friend that they have made it to their destination safely. After a user initiates a Check In, their friend or family member will automatically be notified as soon as the user arrives. If they are not making progress toward their destination, useful information will be temporarily shared with the selected contact, such as the device’s location, battery level, and cell service status. Any information shared is end-to-end encrypted. Easier Sharing with AirDrop and NameDrop AirDrop makes it easy to share a file with a colleague or send photos to a friend in seconds, and with iOS 17, AirDrop gets new ways to share. NameDrop allows users to easily share contact information by simply bringing their iPhones together, or by bringing an iPhone and Apple Watch together.1 With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity between iPhone devices. Improvements to Autocorrect and Dictation Deliver More Intelligent Input Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction — improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. It also receives a refreshed design to better support typing, and sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes. Users will now receive predictive text recommendations inline as they type, so adding entire words or completing sentences is as easy as tapping the space bar, making text entry faster than ever. Dictation leverages a new speech recognition model to make it even more accurate. StandBy Displays Glanceable Information While iPhone Is Charging iOS 17 introduces StandBy, giving users a full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. StandBy is perfect on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or desk, and can be personalised to display a range of beautiful clock styles, favourite photos, or widgets, including Smart Stacks, which surface the right widgets at the right time. With support for Live Activities, Siri, incoming calls, and larger notifications, StandBy makes iPhone even more useful when viewed at a distance. When charging with MagSafe, StandBy remembers a user’s preferred view. It is easy to bring up StandBy anytime by tapping the screen, and on iPhone 14 Pro with the Always-On display, it is always available. A New Way to Appreciate Life’s Moments with Journal Journal is a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, which has been shown to improve wellbeing. Using on-device machine learning, personalised suggestions can be provided to help inspire a user’s journal entry. Suggestions are intelligently curated from recent activity, including photos, people, places, workouts, and more, making it easy to start a journal entry, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps. Additional features in iOS 17 include : Safari adds greater protection for Private Browsing, both from trackers as a user browses, and from people who might have access to a user’s device. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from tracking or identifying a user’s device. Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device. For easier and more secure password and passkeys sharing, users can share passwords with a group of trusted contacts. Everyone in the group can add and edit passwords to keep them up to date. Since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it’s end-to-end encrypted. The Health app offers new mental health features. Users can log their daily moods and momentary emotions; see what might be contributing to their state of mind; and easily access depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics, plus resources available in their region. Additionally, increasing the distance the device is viewed from can help children lower their risk of myopia and gives adult users the opportunity to reduce digital eyestrain. Screen Distance in Screen Time uses the TrueDepth camera to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches from their face for an extended period of time. Maps adds offline maps, so users can download a specific area and access turn-by-turn navigation, see their estimated time of arrival, find places in Maps, and more while offline. Maps also makes it easier than ever to discover thousands of trails in parks across the United States, and supports electric vehicle drivers with real-time charging availability information. AirTag can be shared with up to five other people, allowing friends and family to keep track of an item in Find My. Everyone in a group will be able to see an item’s location, play a sound, and use Precision Finding to help pinpoint the location of a shared AirTag when nearby. This also works with all other Find My network accessories. Apple Music introduces Collaborative Playlists that make listening to music with friends easier than ever before, and SharePlay in the car allows all passengers to easily contribute to what’s playing. 3 Listeners can control the music from their own devices, even if they don’t have an Apple Music subscription. Sharing content using AirPlay is even easier with on-device intelligence now learning a user’s preferences. AirPlay will also work with supported televisions in hotels, allowing users to easily enjoy their favorite content on the TV when traveling. Built with a foundation of privacy and security, this capability will be available before the end of the year in select hotels, starting with brands from IHG Hotels & Resorts. AirPods receive powerful new features, including Adaptive Audio, Personalised Volume, and Conversation Awareness, that redefine the personal audio experience. Plus, improvements to Automatic Switching and call controls make AirPods even easier to use. The Home app adds the ability for users to view up to 30 days of activity history across door locks, garage doors, alarm systems, and contact sensors. Additionally, two popular HomeKit lock features — tap to unlock and PIN codes — are now available for Matter-compatible locks, providing even more ways to connect the home. Reminders features a grocery list that automatically groups added items into categories to make shopping easier. Users can change how the items are grouped and the list remembers their preferences. Visual Look Up is now available in paused video frames. Now users can identify food, storefronts, signs, and symbols, and lift individual subjects from photos and videos. Siri can be activated by simply saying “Siri.” Once activated, users can issue multiple commands in succession without needing to reactivate the assistant. In Photos , the People album uses on-device machine learning to recognize more photos of a user’s favorite people, as well as cats and dogs. Privacy updates include the expansion of Communication Safety beyond Messages to help keep kids safe when sending and receiving content via AirDrop, Contact Posters, a FaceTime message, and when using the Photos picker to choose content to send. It also expands to cover video content in addition to still images. A new feature, Sensitive Content Warning, helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on-device, so Apple does not get access to the content. Accessibility updates include Assistive Access, a customisable interface that helps users with cognitive disabilities use iPhone with greater ease and independence; Live Speech, which gives nonspeaking users the option to type and have their words spoken in person, or on phone and FaceTime calls; Personal Voice, which gives users at risk of speech loss the option to create a voice that sounds like theirs; and Point and Speak, which helps users who are blind or have low vision read text on physical objects by pointing.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Gizmo Laptop Apple introduces the 15‑inch MacBook Air June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple introduced the 15-inch MacBook Air, the world’s best 15-inch laptop. With an expansive 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, the incredible performance of M2, up to 18 hours of battery life,1 and a silent, fanless design, the new MacBook Air brings power and portability — all in the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop. With an all-new six-speaker sound system, the 15-inch MacBook Air delivers immersive Spatial Audio, along with a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, MagSafe charging, and the power and ease of macOS Ventura for an unrivaled experience. Customers can order starting today, with availability beginning Tuesday, June 13. The 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 gets a new starting price of $1,099 — $100 less than before — to deliver even more value and choice to everyone, from upgraders to first-time Mac customers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “We’re thrilled to introduce the first 15-inch MacBook Air. With its incredible performance and striking design, the new MacBook Air is the world’s best 15-inch laptop. And it’s only possible with Apple silicon,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “From its expansive Liquid Retina display and remarkably thin and fanless design, to extraordinary battery life and an immersive six-speaker sound system, the new MacBook Air has it all.” Brilliant 15.3-inch Liquid Retina Display The new MacBook Air features a spacious, high-resolution 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, so users can see even more content. With up to 500 nits of brightness and support for 1 billion colors, the brilliant Liquid Retina display makes content look remarkably rich and vibrant, and text razor sharp. It is also twice the resolution and 25 percent brighter than a comparable PC laptop. World’s Thinnest 15-inch Laptop The new MacBook Air measures only 11.5mm thin, making it the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop. It weighs just 3.3 pounds, so it’s incredibly portable. Even with its expansive display, the new MacBook Air is solid and durable. And it is also nearly 40 percent thinner and half a pound lighter than a comparable PC laptop. MacBook Air also features MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt ports for connecting accessories and up to a 6K external display, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack for versatile connectivity. It comes in four gorgeous finishes — midnight, starlight, space gray, and silver. Blazing Performance and Tremendous Battery Life with M2 With the M2 chip, the 15-inch MacBook Air has incredible performance. It’s up to 12x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.3 When compared to the best-selling 15-inch PC laptop with a Core i7 processor, the new MacBook Air is up to twice as fast.4 It also delivers extraordinary battery life, with up to 18 hours — 50 percent more than on the PC — even with a better display and better performance.5 The 15-inch MacBook Air features a powerful 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, a 10-core GPU for blazing-fast graphics, and a 16-core Neural Engine. M2 also delivers 100GB/s of memory bandwidth and supports up to 24GB of fast unified memory, so multitasking and working with complex workloads is superfluid. The performance of M2 lets users work, play, or create just about anything — anywhere. 1080p FaceTime HD Camera and Six-Speaker Sound System The 1080p FaceTime HD camera on MacBook Air is perfect for FaceTime calls and video conferencing. Combined with the processing power of the advanced image signal processor on M2, users will look great on video calls. A three-mic array captures clean audio using advanced beamforming algorithms, so users come through loud and clear on video calls. The design of the new 15-inch MacBook Air also features a phenomenal new six-speaker sound system with two tweeters and two sets of force-cancelling woofers. The new speakers deliver twice the bass depth for fuller sound, and Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos provides immersive experiences whether listening to music or watching movies. Powerful Productivity with macOS macOS Ventura takes the Mac experience to a whole new level that helps users achieve even more. Messages and Mail are better than ever, while Safari — the world’s fastest browser on Mac — ushers in a passwordless future with passkeys. Continuity Camera brings video conferencing features to any Mac, including Desk View, Center Stage, and Studio Light. Stage Manager automatically organizes apps and windows, so users can concentrate on the task at hand and still see everything in a single glance. With iCloud Shared Photo Library, users can create and share a separate photo library among up to six family members, and the Freeform app provides a flexible canvas that enables users to be even more productive and expressive. Users can work effortlessly across Mac and iPhone with Continuity features like Handoff, AirDrop, Universal Clipboard, and Messages. macOS Sonoma, coming this fall, makes the Mac experience more delightful and productive than ever, including new ways to personalize with widgets and stunning screen savers, an optimized gaming experience with Game Mode, powerful video conferencing capabilities, a big update to Safari, and more. Better for the Environment The new MacBook Air is designed with the environment in mind, now using 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. MacBook Air also features 100 percent recycled cobalt in the MagSafe connector and 90 percent recycled steel in the battery tray. MacBook Air meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and is focused on its Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral. This means every Mac Apple creates, from design to manufacturing to customer use, will have net-zero climate impact. Pricing and Availability The 15-inch MacBook Air with M2 is available to order today on apple.com/in/store . It will begin arriving to customers, and in Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Resellers, beginning Tuesday, June 13. The 15-inch MacBook Air with M2, available in midnight, starlight, silver, and space gray, starts at INR 134900 and INR 124900 for education. With Apple Trade In, customers can trade in their current computer and get credit toward a new Mac. Customers can visit apple.com/shop/trade-in to see what their device is worth. Every customer who buys a Mac from Apple can enjoy a free Online Personal Session with an Apple Specialist, get their product set up — including help with data transfer — in select stores, and receive guidance on how to make their new Mac work the way they want. AppleCare+ for Mac provides expert technical support and additional hardware coverage from Apple, including unlimited incidents of accidental damage protection, each subject to a service fee.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Security Apple announces powerful new privacy and security features June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple announced its latest privacy and security innovations, including major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety, and Lockdown Mode, as well as app privacy improvements. Additionally, Apple introduced new features designed with privacy and security at their core, including Check In, NameDrop, and Live Voicemail. These new efforts are the latest manifestation of Apple’s deeply held belief that privacy is a fundamental human right and that good privacy is built on a foundation of strong security. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said, “Privacy is designed into every new Apple product and feature from the beginning. We are focused on keeping our users in the driver’s seat when it comes to their data by continuing to provide industry-leading privacy features and the best data security in the world. This approach is evident in a number of features on our platforms, like the major updates to Safari Private Browsing, as well as the expansion of Lockdown Mode.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Privacy Features Give Users Greater Control of Their Data Major Updates to Safari Private Browsing Safari introduced private browsing years before any other browser. This year, a significant update provides even greater protection against trackers as users browse the web and from people who might have access to their device. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from using the latest techniques to track or identify a user’s device. Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device. Photos Privacy Permission Improvements A new embedded Photos picker can help users share specific photos with apps while keeping the rest of their library private. When apps ask to access the user’s entire photo library, the user will be shown more information about what they’ll be sharing, along with occasional reminders of their choice. Link Tracking Protection in Messages, Mail, and Safari Private Browsing Some websites add extra information to their URLs in order to track users across other websites. Now this information will be removed from the links users share in Messages and Mail, and the links will still work as expected. This information will also be removed from links in Safari Private Browsing. App Privacy Improvements New tools give developers more information about the data practices of third-party software development kits (SDKs) they use in their apps, allowing them to provide even more accurate Privacy Nutrition Labels. These changes also improve the integrity of the software supply chain by supporting signatures for third-party SDKs to add another layer of protection against abuse. Features Designed to Help Protect User Safety Communication Safety Communication Safety, designed to warn children when receiving or sending photos in Messages that contain nudity, now covers video content in addition to still images. A new API lets developers integrate Communication Safety right into their apps. Additionally, the feature will now help keep kids safe when they’re sending and receiving an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and when using the Phone app to receive a Contact Poster and the Photos picker to choose content to send. All image and video processing for Communication Safety occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content. These warnings will be turned on for the child accounts in their Family Sharing plan, and can be disabled by the parent. Sensitive Content Warning Sensitive Content Warning helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos when receiving them in Messages, an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and the Phone app when receiving a Contact Poster, all using the same privacy-preserving technology at the core of Communication Safety. The feature is optional and can be turned on by the user in Privacy & Security settings. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content. Powerful Security Protections to Safeguard User Data Passwords and Passkeys Updates For easier and more secure password and passkey sharing, users can create a group to share a set of passwords, and everyone in the group can add and edit passwords to keep them up to date. Since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it is end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, one-time verification codes received in Mail will now automatically autofill in Safari, making it easy to securely log in without leaving the browser. Lockdown Mode Lockdown Mode expands to provide even more protections for those who may be targeted by mercenary spyware because of who they are or what they do. New protections encompass safer wireless connectivity defaults, media handling, media sharing defaults, sandboxing, and network security optimizations. Turning on Lockdown Mode further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface for those who need additional protections. Additionally, Lockdown Mode will be supported on watchOS. Additional Features Designed with Privacy and Security at Their Core Check In makes it easy for users to let friends or family members know they’ve reached their destination safely. Once turned on by the user, Check In automatically detects when the user has reached their intended destination, and will let selected contacts know via Messages. In the case that something unexpected happens while the user is on their way, Check In will recognise that the user is not making progress toward their declared destination and check in with them. If they don’t respond, the feature will share useful information — like the user’s precise location, battery level, cell service status, and the last active time using their iPhone — with the contacts the user selected. In addition to making it easier to get help if needed, Check In is designed around privacy and security, keeping the user in control by letting them choose whom to share their information with, including the destination and time duration that they set. Users can end the Check In session at any time. Information sent with Check In is end-to-end encrypted so only the user’s family member or friend can read it, not Apple or anyone else. With NameDrop , a new AirDrop experience, a user can hold their iPhone near another to share their contact information with only their intended recipients. Users can also choose the specific contact details they want to share — and, importantly, what information they don’t want to share. Users can also share content like photos or links the same way. Apple Watch users can also use NameDrop by tapping the Share button in My Card in the Contacts app, or by tapping the My Card watch face complication, and then bringing Apple Watch face to face with someone else’s Apple Watch. As with all AirDrop experiences, these new features securely share content over an encrypted connection. Live Voicemail makes it easier to know when to answer a phone call. When someone calls and starts to leave a message, users will see a live transcription as the caller speaks. If the user wants to talk to the caller, they can pick up the call at any time. When Silence Unknown Callers is turned on, calls from unknown numbers will go directly to Live Voicemail without ringing. Calls identified as spam by carriers won’t appear as Live Voicemail, and will instead be instantly declined. This gives the user more peace of mind that spam, scams, or calls that may be invasive of privacy, can be ignored without missing important calls. Thanks to the power of the Neural Engine, Live Voicemail occurs entirely on device, and this information is not shared with Apple. These features will be coming in free software updates this fall.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Gizmo Smartwatch Introducing watchOS 10, a milestone update for Apple Watch June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple previewed watchOS 10, bringing Apple Watch users a fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps, a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed, and delightful new watch faces. New metrics, Workout Views, and Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrive for cyclists, while new Compass Waypoints and Maps capabilities further help hikers. The Mindfulness app offers additional tools to support mental health. watchOS 10 is available as a developer beta and will be available as a free software update this fall. “watchOS is the world’s most advanced wearable operating system, and it has redefined how people all over the world think of what a watch can do,” said Kevin Lynch, Apple’s vice president of Technology. “watchOS 10 is a major milestone and an energizing new approach for Apple Watch, introducing a fresh new design for quickly viewing information, delightful new watch faces, new features for cyclists and hikers, and important tools for health.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); New Design Language and Navigation With watchOS 10, redesigned apps provide more information at a glance, and there are new ways to navigate and quickly access content. “With watchOS 10, we’ve redesigned the interface, allowing users to experience Apple Watch like never before,” said Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design. “The update gives users the information that matters most to them at a glance, simplified navigation, and a new visual language that takes full advantage of the Apple Watch display. We’re also introducing the Smart Stack, offering quick access to proactive and relevant information, right from the watch face.” Apple Watch apps, including Weather, Stocks, Home, Maps, Messages, World Clock, and others, now utilise more of the Apple Watch display for more glanceable information. The Activity app on Apple Watch and the Fitness app on iPhone make tracking daily movement even easier with more details, improvements to sharing, a redesigned trophy case, and Apple Fitness+ trainer tips. A new Smart Stack contains widgets that display timely information that adapts to the user’s context and can be revealed with a simple turn of the Digital Crown from any watch face. For example, at the beginning of the day, Weather will show the forecast, or, when traveling, the Smart Stack will show boarding passes from Wallet. Calendar and Reminders will reshuffle to the top to display upcoming meetings or tasks, and apps that are running, such as Podcasts, will also move up so they are readily available. Smart Stack also enables users to enjoy a beautiful watch face, like Portraits, while still offering a way to quickly access information they care about. Developers can also use the new design language to update their apps. For example, Streaks now utilises the entire display to easily show progress and access tasks, the NBA app makes keeping up with a favourite team even more compelling with team colours and new game details, and with Waterllama’s redesign, users can quickly glance at their hydration from the last seven days with just a turn of the Digital Crown. Control Center is now accessible using the side button, making it easy to quickly open it at any time, over any app. A double-click of the Digital Crown reverts back to any apps used recently. New Watch Faces watchOS 10 introduces two new artistic and joyful watch faces: Palette and Snoopy. The Palette face depicts time in a wide variety of colours using three distinct overlapping layers, and as the time changes, the colours on the display also shift. Additionally, the beloved comic strip Peanuts comes to life on Apple Watch with a new watch face featuring Snoopy and Woodstock. The characters interact and play with the watch hands, react to the weather conditions in the area, or even get active when the user does a workout. Cycling Apple Watch is a great device for cyclists, with features including automatic Workout reminders, calorimetry for e-biking, and Fall Detection. watchOS 10 takes this popular activity even further with advanced new metrics, views, and experiences. When a cycling workout is started from Apple Watch in watchOS 10, it will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and, when tapped, will utilise the full screen. Workout Views, such as Heart Rate Zones, Elevation, Race Route, Custom Workouts, and a new Cycling Speed view, have been optimised for the display size of iPhone, which can be mounted to a bike for convenient, easy viewing during a ride. Apple Watch can now automatically connect to Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories, such as power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors. This enables brand-new metrics, including cycling power (watts) and cadence (RPM), and additional Workout Views, including Power Zones. Bluetooth connection is supported for Indoor and Outdoor cycling workouts, as well as GymKit. New algorithms combining sensor data from Apple Watch and connected power meters can estimate Functional Threshold Power (FTP), the highest level of cycling intensity that a rider could theoretically maintain for an hour. Using FTP, Apple Watch calculates personalised Power Zones, used to easily see the current zone and track how long is spent in each, which is an effective and popular way of improving performance. Hiking The Compass app on Apple Watch is a helpful tool for exploring the great outdoors. With watchOS 10, Compass automatically generates two new waypoints: A Last Cellular Connection Waypoint will estimate the last place with cellular reception, which may be useful for checking messages or making a call. In case of emergencies, a Last Emergency Call Waypoint will estimate where on the route their device had the last connection to any available carrier’s network so that an emergency call can be made. When preparing routes, a new Elevation view uses altimeter data, offering a three-dimensional view of saved waypoints. And starting in the U.S., Apple Maps displays a new topographic map featuring contour lines, hill shading, elevation details, and points of interest. Users can also search for nearby trails and trailheads, with place cards that include detailed information, like trail length, type, and difficulty. Mental Health Mental health is as important as physical health, and research shows that reflecting on state of mind can help build emotional awareness and resilience. With the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10, users can discreetly and conveniently log their momentary emotions and daily moods. Users can turn the Digital Crown to scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes to choose how they are feeling, select what is having the biggest impact on them, and describe their feelings. In the Health app in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, users can see valuable insights to identify what might be contributing to their state of mind — whether it’s associations or lifestyle factors, like sleep or exercise. Additionally, depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics are now easily accessible in the Health app and can help users determine their risk level, connect to resources available in their region, and create a PDF to share with their doctor. Vision Health Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the leading cause of vision impairment globally. To reduce the risk of myopia, the International Myopia Institute recommends children spend at least 80-120 minutes a day outdoors. With watchOS 10, Apple Watch introduces the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor. Users can view this information in the Health app on iPhone or iPad. Time spent in daylight can provide additional benefits to physical and mental health for all ages. And children who do not have their own iPhone can use Family Setup to pair their Apple Watch to their parent’s iPhone, giving parents visibility into the amount of time their kids are spending in daylight with Health Sharing. Viewing something like a device or a book too closely has also been documented as a myopia risk factor. The new Screen Distance feature uses the same TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID in iPad and iPhone to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches for an extended period of time. When a device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all Health app data, including mental health and vision health data, is encrypted. 1 Additional watchOS 10 updates include : NameDrop allows users to easily share contact information by bringing Apple Watch close to someone else’s iPhone. Apple Watch users can also use NameDrop by tapping the Share button in My Card in the Contacts app, or by tapping the My Card watch face complication, and then bringing Apple Watch face to face with someone else’s Apple Watch. 2 Offline maps on iPhone provide access to turn-by-turn navigation, estimated time of arrival, places in Maps, and more while away from Wi-Fi or cellular services. These features can also be used on a paired Apple Watch that is in range of its companion iPhone. Users can now initiate playback of a FaceTime video message and view it directly on Apple Watch. Additionally, Group FaceTime audio is now supported on Apple Watch. The Medications app can send follow-up reminders if a medication hasn’t been logged 30 minutes after the scheduled time. Apple Fitness+ introduces Custom Plans , a new way to receive a custom workout or meditation schedule based on day, duration, workout type, and more; Stacks , which allows users to select multiple workouts and meditations to do seamlessly back to back; and Audio Focus , which gives users the ability to prioritise the volume of the music or the trainers’ voices. Enterprise Apple Watch offers enterprise customers features to enhance productivity and safety in the office or in the field, such as hands-free communication and responding to notifications on the go, or Fall Detection on a job site. watchOS 10 introduces support for Mobile Device Management (MDM), enabling enterprise customers to remotely and centrally install apps and configure accounts on a fleet of devices, with features such as passcode enforcement, and configuring Wi-Fi and VPN settings. With this update, Apple Watch can further help improve employee wellness, productivity and health, and safety monitoring. APIs for Workout App Developers watchOS 10 includes new APIs for workout app developers that will allow them to create compelling new experiences. The powerful motion sensors on both Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra can detect rapid changes in velocity and acceleration, such as when swinging a golf club or a tennis racket. Now, developers will have access to this high-frequency motion data, so apps like SwingVision can analyse serve pronation, which is the twisting motion of the forearm, wrist, and hand, and Golfshot can detect small wrist movements to refine a golf swing. Popular coaching platforms such as TrainingPeaks can use a new API to create a Custom Workout that can be imported directly into the Workout app. App developers using HealthKit for workouts will be able to provide validated calories for golf workouts, as the variation between using a golf cart or walking on the green is now identified. Developers can also access speed, cadence, and power metrics for cycling, plus mirror workouts from Apple Watch to iPhone. Availability The developer beta of watchOS 10 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com starting today. A public beta will be available to watchOS users next month at beta.apple.com . watchOS 10 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 4 or later paired with iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 17. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages, or on all devices. Features are subject to change.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News iPadOS 17 brings new levels of personalisation and versatility to iPad June 6, 2023 June 6, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple previewed iPadOS 17, delivering entirely new ways for users to personalise the Lock Screen and interact with widgets. Working with PDFs is easier with AutoFill, which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms, and Notes brings a new experience for marking up and collaborating on PDFs. Messages gets significant updates, including a new stickers experience, and users can now leave FaceTime video and audio messages. The Health app comes to iPad with interactive charts, and HealthKit enables developers to create innovative experiences designed for the iPad display. iPadOS 17 is available as a developer beta today, and will be available as a free software update this fall. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering, said, “iPadOS powers our most versatile device and enables users to do so many things on iPad, and now with iPadOS 17, we deliver an experience that’s even more personal and capable. With interactive widgets on the Lock Screen, updates to PDFs and Notes, as well as enhancements to Messages and FaceTime, iPadOS gives users even more ways to get things done easier and faster than ever.” A Personalised and Beautiful Lock Screen Experience Taking full advantage of the iPad display, users can now customise the Lock Screen to make it more personal, useful, and beautiful. Rich new photo features allow users to set their favourite images on the Lock Screen and stylise them in new ways. Users can select a photo from their personal library, a dynamic set of photos that shuffle throughout the day, or a Live Photo for a smooth slow-motion effect whenever they wake iPad. Users can choose a wallpaper from the Lock Screen gallery that will look stunning on the large canvas of iPad, pick from a set of expressive font styles and colours to customise the look of the date and time, or create unique designs with their favourite emoji and colour combinations. Live Activities comes to iPadOS, allowing users to stay on top of things that are happening in real time right from the Lock Screen, such as a sports game, travel plans, or a food delivery order. More Powerful Widgets Widgets get interactive in iPadOS 17, allowing users to get tasks done with just a tap. For example, users can turn on the lights, play a song, or mark a reminder as complete in the moment, right from a widget. And with updates to WidgetKit, developers can build interactivity into their widgets. Interactive widgets are now available on the Lock Screen and Home Screen, making it easy to take action and get helpful information at a glance. On the Lock Screen, widgets blend seamlessly with the wallpaper with adaptive tinting to optimise for legibility. Working with PDFs Is Even Easier Entering information in PDFs is now easier than ever. iPadOS 17 uses machine learning to identify fields in a PDF so that users can quickly add details, such as names, addresses, and emails from Contacts. Notes Introduces a New PDF Experience A big update to the Notes app gives users new ways to organise, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs. In iPadOS 17, PDFs appear full width, making it easy to flip through pages, make a quick annotation, or sketch directly in the document with Apple Pencil. Users can now review and mark up PDFs and scanned documents right in their note, and with live collaboration, updates appear in real time when users are sharing a note with others. Messages Gets More Interactive with Enhanced Communication Tools Messages offers new ways to connect, including a stickers experience with emoji stickers, and the ability for users to create Live Stickers from their own photos by lifting a subject from the background. Users can also add effects to Live Stickers that help bring conversations to life. Available from the keyboard, a new drawer gathers all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iPadOS. New Messages features include an expandable menu that appears with a simple tap for easy access to the user’s most frequently used iMessage apps. The search experience is improved with filters — including people, keywords, and content types — that allow more specificity in finding exactly what users are looking for. Users can now easily jump to their last-read message in an active group chat, and replying to a message inline is even simpler and quicker by swiping on a message bubble. Audio messages are transcribed automatically so users can read them in the moment or listen later. When a user shares their location in Messages, it shows up live in the conversation until the sharing session is over. More Expressive Ways to Communicate with FaceTime In FaceTime, users can leave an audio or video message when someone doesn’t pick up the call. FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions, such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video-calling apps can take advantage of them as well. In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPad and then hand it off to Apple TV to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room. Safari Helps Users Be More Productive Improvements to Safari allow users to be more productive than ever. With Profiles, users can keep their browsing separate between topics like work and personal. Each profile has their own history, cookies, Tab Groups, and Favourites, and it’s easy to switch between them. Private Browsing now allows users to lock the window they’re viewing with Face ID or Touch ID, and removes trackers used for cross-site tracking. The search experience gets even better with increased responsiveness, more relevant search suggestions, and easier-to-read suggestions. The Health App Comes to iPad iPadOS 17 brings the Health app to iPad, giving users new ways to see their health data in rich detail. With an optimised design for the iPad display, Favourites has a new look, and users can receive insights into their health data with Trends, Highlights, and detailed interactive charts. Now, iPad users can also track and manage their medications, use Cycle Tracking, log their momentary emotions and daily moods, view their available health records from multiple institutions, and more — all in one central, secure, and private place. Health and fitness developers can now use HealthKit on iPad, opening up new opportunities to create innovative experiences in their apps that incorporate data users choose to share, with rigorous privacy and data security protocols from the Health app. Additional iPadOS 17 updates include : Stage Manager adds even more flexibility to the position and size of the windows, giving users more control over their workspace, and supports built-in cameras on an external display. Freeform offers new drawing tools; support for hover, tilt, and snap to shape; the ability to add connection lines and new shapes to any object; and Follow Along to guide collaborators around the board. Spotlight helps users find information and take action even faster by offering shortcuts to the next action, enhanced visual results, and video search. Visual Look Up expands its recognition capabilities to food, storefronts, and signs and symbols on things like the laundry tags on clothes. Keyboard brings improvements to autocorrect, allowing users to enter text faster and easier than ever before. Inline predictive text helps users quickly finish sentences, and the new speech recognition model in Dictation improves accuracy. Siri can now be activated by simply saying “Siri.” Once activated, users can issue multiple commands back to back without needing to reactivate it. Sharing content using AirPlay is even easier with on-device intelligence now learning a user’s preferences. AirPlay will also work with supported TVs in hotels, allowing users to easily enjoy their favourite content on the TV when traveling. Built with a foundation of privacy and security, this capability will be available before the end of the year in select hotels, starting with brands from IHG Hotels & Resorts. Reminders introduces a new intelligent grocery list experience, making shopping easier by automatically grouping related items into sections, and provides a new column view to display sections horizontally across the screen. Maps now allows users to download maps and use them while offline. Users can select an area, search and explore rich place information, and get routes for all modes of mobility, all while offline. Privacy updates include the expansion of Communication Safety, adding protections for children as well as a Sensitive Content Warning for adults. Updates to Photos and Calendar permissions help users make more informed choices about what data they share with apps. And a Lockdown Mode update enhances the protections for those who may be targeted by mercenary spyware. New accessibility tools make iPad even more accessible. Assistive Access is a customisable interface that helps users with cognitive disabilities use iPad with greater ease and independence. Live Speech helps nonspeaking users type what they want to say and have it read aloud during phone, FaceTime, and in-person conversations. Personal Voice gives users at risk of speech loss the option to create a personalised voice that sounds like them and integrates seamlessly with Live Speech. And in Magnifier, Point and Speak helps users who are blind or have low vision interact with electrical appliances and other physical objects with small text labels. Availability The developer beta of iPadOS 17 is available to Apple Developer Program members at developer.apple.com , and a public beta will be available to iPadOS users next month at beta.apple.com . New software features will be available this fall as a free software update for iPad (6th generation and later), iPad mini (5th generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later).

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Apple introduces the advanced new Apple Watch Series 9 September 12, 2023 September 12, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple introduced Apple Watch Series 9, bringing new features to the world’s best-selling watch and achieving a significant environmental milestone. Apple Watch Series 9 is more powerful than ever with the new S9 SiP, which increases performance and capabilities; a magical new double tap gesture; a brighter display; faster on-device Siri, now with the ability to access and log health data; Precision Finding for iPhone; and more. Apple Watch Series 9 runs watchOS 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new watch faces, new cycling and hiking features, and tools to support mental health. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple’s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030. The new Apple Watch lineup can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22. “Apple Watch is an indispensable companion that helps millions of people with their health, fitness, communications, and safety,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “We’re introducing our best Apple Watch lineup, with incredible new capabilities and technological advancements, including a new double tap gesture, brighter display, on-device Siri, as well as our first-ever carbon neutral products. Whether users are upgrading from earlier models or buying their first, there’s never been a more compelling time to experience Apple Watch.” “At Apple, we are committed to making products customers love and protecting the planet at the same time, and this year, we hit a key milestone toward our Apple 2030 goal,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our first carbon neutral products were made in a uniquely Apple way, steeply reducing carbon emissions from materials, electricity, and transportation through innovation and design.” Powerful New S9 SiP Apple Watch Series 9 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Series 9 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, when compared with Apple Watch Series 8. The power efficiency of the S9 SiP allows Apple Watch Series 9 to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life. 1 Double Tap Gesture Innovations such as the Digital Crown and Taptic Engine — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9. Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, and even to take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack. This new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Series 9, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month. Brighter Display The power-efficient S9 SiP and advanced display architecture increase the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display up to 2000 nits — double that of Series 8 — making it even easier to read text in bright sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by. On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate than Apple Watch Series 8. On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, or about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as their weight, period, or medications taken. 2 Precision Finding and HomePod Integration The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room. UWB also brings deeper integration between Apple Watch and HomePod. When an Apple Watch user gets within 4 meters of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media. Or if nothing is playing on HomePod, media suggestions will appear at the top of the Smart Stack. Featuring watchOS 10 Apple Watch Series 9 runs watchOS 10, a milestone update that includes: A fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps and a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed. Delightful new watch faces : Snoopy, Palette, and Solar Analog. A new Nike watch face, Nike Globe, lights up the lines on the globe with each passing second. Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrives for cyclists, unlocking new metrics and Workout Views , and cycling workouts. A cycling workout can automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and utilize the full screen when tapped. New Compass Waypoints and Maps capabilities to further help during outdoor adventures. Additional tools to support mental health with state of mind logging in the Mindfulness app . The ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor to help reduce the risk of myopia and provide additional benefits to physical and mental health for all ages. Carbon Neutral Models Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch SE are Apple’s first-ever carbon neutral products. As part of Apple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch packaging has been redesigned to be 100 percent fiber-based, and a new logo on the packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral. Apple Watch SE Apple Watch SE continues to deliver the core Apple Watch experience at a more affordable price point, and is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, use with Family Setup, or gift to their loved ones. Additionally, Apple Watch SE offers Activity tracking, high and low heart rate notifications, Fall Detection, Emergency SOS, Crash Detection, and watchOS 10. Lineup Apple Watch Series 9 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes in starlight, midnight, silver, (PRODUCT)RED, and a new pink aluminum case, as well as stainless steel in gold, silver, and graphite cases. Any aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 with a new Sport Loop band is carbon neutral. Apple Watch SE is available in 40mm and 44mm aluminum cases, and is carbon neutral when paired with a new Sport Loop band. Apple Watch Hermès is available in stainless steel in silver and space black. Bands Apple is introducing FineWoven, a luxurious and durable microtwill made of 68 percent post-consumer recycled content that has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather. FineWoven has a suedelike feel, and is available with the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle bands. Starting today, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple product, including watch bands. The popular Sport Loop band has been redesigned to include 82 percent recycled yarn. All new Apple Watch Sport Loops are carbon neutral. Apple worked with Nike and Hermès on more environmentally friendly band collections. The Nike Sport Band now contains 32 percent or more recycled fluoroelastomer, including colorful flakes made from excess bands that create a randomized pattern, making each band unique, while the Nike Sport Loop with a space-dye pattern repurposes yarn from previous seasons. A new collection of Hermès bands draws on the house’s rich history in textiles and craftsmanship. Two new woven bands are introduced: Toile H is an interpretation of the brand’s signature checked canvas, and Twill Jump is a rich solid color with contrasting details. The first-ever knitted band for Apple Watch, Bridon, is hand-braided with a bold chevron pattern, while Kilim is made of sporty, waterproof molded rubber and has a deployment buckle. A classic new watch face, Hermès Radial, complements these four new band styles. 3 Pricing and Availability Customers in Australia , Canada , France , Germany , India , Japan , the UAE , the U.K. , the U.S. , and more than 40 other countries and regions can order Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch SE today, with availability in stores beginning Friday, September 22.

    "article_content": "Apple Breaking News Apple unveils iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max September 12, 2023 September 13, 2023 technuter 0 Comments Apple today debuted iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, designed with aerospace-grade titanium that’s strong yet lightweight to deliver Apple’s lightest Pro models ever. The new design also features contoured edges and a customizable Action button, allowing users to personalize their iPhone experience. Powerful camera upgrades enable the equivalent of seven pro lenses with incredible image quality, including a more advanced 48MP Main camera system that now supports the new super-high-resolution 24MP default, the next generation of portraits with Focus and Depth Control, improvements to Night mode and Smart HDR, and an all-new 5x Telephoto camera exclusively on iPhone 15 Pro Max. A17 Pro unlocks next-level gaming experiences and pro performance. The new USB‑C connector is supercharged with USB 3 speeds — up to 20x faster than USB 2 — and together with new video formats, enables powerful pro workflows that were not possible before. And with the addition of Roadside Assistance via satellite, the iPhone 15 Pro lineup builds on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure to connect users to help if they have car trouble while off the grid. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be available in four stunning new finishes, including black titanium, white titanium, blue titanium, and natural titanium. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 15, with availability beginning Friday, September 22. “This is the most pro lineup we have ever created, with a state-of-the-art titanium design, the best iPhone camera system yet that enables game-changing new workflows, and the A17 Pro chip, which ushers in a new chapter of performance and games never before seen on iPhone,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max represent the best of Apple design and industry-first innovations to help enrich the everyday experiences of our users, while enabling them to unleash their creativity.” A Stunning, Lightweight, and Durable Design Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a strong and lightweight titanium design — a first for iPhone. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience. The all-new Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight; activating Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or using Shortcuts for more options. A press-and-hold gesture with fine-tuned haptic feedback and visual cues in the Dynamic Island ensure the new button launches the intended action. A17 Pro: A New Generation of Apple Silicon for iPhone Bringing pro performance and capabilities, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are powered by A17 Pro, the industry’s first 3-nanometer chip. Continuing Apple’s leadership in smartphone silicon, A17 Pro brings improvements to the entire chip, including the biggest GPU redesign in Apple’s history. The new CPU is up to 10 percent faster with microarchitectural and design improvements, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — iPhone 15 Pro offers smoother graphics, as well as more immersive AR applications and gaming experiences. iPhone 15 Pro brings true-to-life gaming to the palm of users’ hands with console titles never before seen on a smartphone, like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassin’s Creed Mirage. A17 Pro includes a dedicated AV1 decoder, enabling more efficient, high-quality video experiences for streaming services. Additionally, a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, now supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR. A Powerful Pro Camera System for More Creative Control Through a deep integration of hardware and software, the advanced camera systems on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max both pack the equivalent of seven pro lenses — all enabled by A17 Pro. With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the Main camera also supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. Great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple’s most advanced stabilization system yet. Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and better low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Additional features that benefit all cameras on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max include: Night mode gets better with sharper details and more vivid colors, now powered by the Photonic Engine, including Night mode portraits, enabled by the LiDAR scanner. New Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. The best quality video in a smartphone is upgraded thanks to A17 Pro, with improvements in low-light video and Action mode. The preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers gets even better with new pro workflows. Users can now get up to 20x faster transfer speeds with an optional USB 3 cable. iPhone and third-party solutions like Capture One also help photographers create a pro studio, allowing them to shoot and instantly transfer 48MP ProRAW images from iPhone to Mac. ProRes video can be recorded directly to external storage, enabling higher recording options up to 4K at 60 fps, and greater flexibility on set when using iPhone as the main camera. iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Color Encoding System, a global standard for color workflows. Coming later this year, iPhone 15 Pro will add a new dimension to video capture with the ability to record spatial video for Apple Vision Pro. Users will be able to capture precious moments in three dimensions and relive those memories with incredible depth on Apple Vision Pro when it is available early next year in the U.S. Next-Level Wireless Performance and Connectivity The iPhone 15 Pro lineup offers convenient new ways to charge, find friends in busy places, and stay connected while traveling. Both models use the USB‑C connector, a universally accepted standard for charging and transferring data, allowing the same cable to charge iPhone, Mac, iPad, and the updated AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Users can also charge AirPods or Apple Watch directly from iPhone with the USB‑C connector. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support USB 3 for data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, up to 20x faster than before. Both models feature the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, enabling two iPhone devices with this chip to connect at three times the range as before. This opens up a new way to use Precision Finding for Find My friends, so iPhone 15 users can share their location and find each other, even in crowds. Precision Finding is built with the same privacy protections that users have come to trust in Find My. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now support Wi-Fi 6E for greater wireless performance, including up to 2x faster speeds, and introduces the first Thread-enabled smartphones, opening up future opportunities for Home app integrations. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come equipped with super-fast 5G, and include: Support for MagSafe and future Qi2 wireless charging. Improved audio quality on phone calls, including those made on FaceTime or third-party apps. Sound quality gets even better when users select Voice Isolation, so conversations come through loud and clear, even if they are somewhere noisy. eSIM with support from more than 295 carriers. When traveling the world, users can stay connected through affordable international roaming plans from their existing carrier, or purchase prepaid eSIM plans in over 50 countries and regions, including Australia, Italy, Thailand, and more. Expanded Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite. Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month. Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider. An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers. Featuring iOS 17 iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature iOS 17, making iPhone even more personal and intuitive with new features: The Phone app gets major updates, with Contact Posters that allow users to customize how they appear to their contacts, and Live Voicemail , which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message. Messages gets a new stickers experience, more powerful search, transcription of audio messages, and Check In , which allows users to automatically notify friends and family when they have made it to their destination safely. NameDrop gives users a new way to use AirDrop to more easily share contact information by simply bringing two iPhone devices together. The same gesture can be used to AirDrop content and more, and now users can step away from each other and finish sending large files over the internet. StandBy gives users a customizable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. With the Always-On display of iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, StandBy stays on to show useful information — perfect on a desk, nightstand, or kitchen counter. Interactive widgets on the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and in StandBy allow users to take action with just a tap, making it easy to complete a to-do, or play or pause a song right from the widget. Safari adds greater protection for Private Browsing and introduces profiles, helping users separate their browsing for topics like work and personal. iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal, a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, improvements to autocorrect and Dictation that make entering text faster and easier than ever before, password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain, and much more. Better for the Environment iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025. To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather. Pricing and Availability iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be available in black titanium, white titanium, blue titanium, and natural titanium finishes. iPhone 15 Pro remains at the same starting price of $999 (U.S.) or $41.62 (U.S.) per month, available in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacities. iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199 (U.S.) or $49.95 (U.S.) per month, available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacities.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Telecom DoT allots separate numbering series exclusively for service and transactional voice calls May 30, 2024 technuter 0 Comments Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has introduced a new numbering series, 160xxxxxxx for making service/transactional calls. This initiative is a step towards providing citizens with a way to easily identify such legitimate calls. Currently 140xxxxxxx series has been allocated to telemarketers for making promotional/service/transactional voice calls. As 140xx series is being used extensively for promotional calls, consumers normally do not respond to such calls and many important service/transactional calls are missed. This has resulted in wide use of regular 10-digit numbers by genuine entities for making service/transactional calls. This also gave opportunity to fraudsters to deceive consumers using 10-digit numbers. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Hence, in order to create confidence among the consumers and to enable them to distinguish between the spam calls originating from 10-digit unknown numbers and the genuine service/transactional calls from genuine Principle Entities, there was a need of separate number series to cater service/transactional voice calls. To fulfil this need, the DoT has allocated a new numbering series, i.e., 160xxxxxxx which will exclusively be used for service/transactional voice calls by the Principle Entities. This clear differentiation between service/transactional calls versus other types of calls will make it easier for citizens to manage their communication. Now, for example, the service/transactional calls originating from Financial Entities like by RBI, SEBI, PFRDA, IRDA, etc shall start from 1601. Telecom Service Providers (TSP) shall be ensuring adequate verification of every entity before assigning a number from 160 series and the entity shall undertake to use it only for service/transactional calls as per Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR), 2018. Consumers can have more confidence in the legitimacy of calls from the 160xxxxxxx series, reducing the risk of falling victim to scams. For any suspected fraud communications, Citizen are advised to report it on Chakshu facility at Sanchar Saathi ( www.sancharsaathi.gov.in ). The DoT encourages consumers to activate the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) Do Not Disturb (DND) feature to block unwanted promotional calls, further enhancing their protection against spam. Details on New Number Scheme Service Call means a voice call made to recipient either with his consent or using a template registered for the purpose, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate, complete, or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously consented to enter into with the sender; or to provide warranty information, product recall information, safety or security information with respect to a commercial product or service used or purchased by the recipient; Transactional Call means a voice call which is not promotional in nature and is for the purpose of alerts to its own customers or account holders and information to be communicated by the voice call is time critical in the nature; Promotional Call means commercial communication voice call for which the Sender has not taken any explicit consent from the Recipient to make such voice calls to him.

    "article_content": "Breaking News Oracle APEX AI Assistant Enables Natural Language-Based Development of Enterprise Applications June 18, 2024 technuter 0 Comments Oracle announced new AI innovations in the latest release of the Oracle APEX low-code development platform. The new APEX AI Assistant simplifies application development and helps developers quickly build feature-rich, mission-critical applications at scale. Developers now can create applications by using natural language prompts to specify desired capabilities and components and automatically generate SQL statements, perform one-click debug correction, eliminate the need to remember table names, and easily add an out-of-the-box conversational interface to their applications. Oracle APEX is a fully supported, no-cost feature of Oracle Database and all Oracle Database services including Oracle Autonomous Database that developers can try for free here. By replacing complex traditional coding, Oracle APEX’s declarative development approach enables developers to build and deploy mission-critical enterprise applications 20X faster with 100X less code. With over 21 million applications built, Oracle APEX is the platform of choice for over 850,000 developers in organizations across industries worldwide. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “As a developer and someone who writes SQL every day, I know how challenging it can be to remember table names, column names, and syntax I don’t frequently use. Having an AI assistant to determine column names contextually, JOINS, and generate complex syntax is a real game changer,” said Mike Hichwa, senior vice president, software development, Oracle. “Best of all, I can use plain natural language, such as ‘show me all pink T-shirts in size large left over from the most recent shipments to our Kansas City and Wichita locations’ and the APEX AI Assistant will automate that for me, and show me the precise results.” Oracle APEX is included in Oracle Database and all Oracle Database services including Oracle Autonomous Database, delivering extreme application performance, as well as industry-hardened security, availability, and scalability. For example, when used in conjunction with AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai, Oracle APEX offers a way for developers to combine semantic search for documents, images, and other unstructured data with searches on private business data. New AI enhancements in Oracle APEX include: APEX AI Assistant: Enables the creation of valid SQL statements from a natural language user prompt. APEX AI Assistant remembers SQL syntax, so developers don’t have to and automates the writing of SQL queries. It explains existing code and suggests code bug fixes that can be adopted with a simple click, freeing developers from routine coding tasks. Create App Assistant: Enables the creation of new application blueprints from a natural language user prompt that specifies desired attributes and capabilities. This simplifies the development of new applications and allows developers to focus their energy and resources on creating unique, bespoke application features rather than underlying code. Conversational AI dialogs: Enables end-users to “converse” with their applications in natural language through an out-of-the-box conversational interface that developers can easily add to their applications. As a result, developers can provide a richer in-app experience without the need to build generative AI or natural language processing components from scratch. The new version of Oracle APEX is available to use today and will be demonstrated at the APEX Conference at ODTUG Kscope24 from July 14 – 18 in Nashville, TN.

V Rajanna, President, Technology, Software and Services, TCS, said, “Xerox and TCS have been on a collaboration and co-innovation journey for over two decades, which has grown from strength to strength transforming business functions from finance to HR along the way. We are now excited to partner with Xerox to support their Reinvention to create the foundation for long-term, sustainable growth by establishing the digital core leveraging cloud, AI and next-generation enterprise platforms.” This announcement reinforces TCS’ strong presence in the US, the largest market for the organization with nearly 50,000 associates and 19 delivery centers. In the 50 years of operations in the region, TCS has established itself as a partner of choice for digital transformation by clients across industry sectors. Amit Bajaj, President, North America, TCS, said, “Xerox’s Reinvention is a bold initiative founded in the belief that a 100+ year-old organization can rapidly transform itself to be a much simpler, agile, and technology-led firm to better serve its clients. GenAI has catalyzed the next S-curve of enterprise transformation, and we are proud to be partnering with legends of American industry, such as Xerox, to go beyond use cases to realize the promise of this pathbreaking technology at an enterprise scale.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Your email address will not be published.

    "article_content": "Listicle Industries riding high on innovative technologies in 2024 May 27, 2024 technuter 0 Comments It’s remarkable to see how technology has seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, simplifying the way we live. While digitalization has ensured that we get things on our mobile phones, it has ensured that everything becomes more convenient and faster. Even as the agri industry is undergoing a major change currently, the fintech industry is seeing a radical change as both consumers and service providers go online. The food and health industries have also stayed abreast with the times and created innovative products. These are some sectors of the economy that, in 2024, have embraced technology and are contributing to the welfare of all people. Fin-Tech: (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Digitalization is occurring in the Banking, Finance, and Insurance (BFSI) sector at a rate never seen before. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics are two examples of technology that has been introduced to change these industries’ processes. In terms of fraud detection, portfolio analytics, and financial risk management, Payoda helps banks and financial services companies find new markets, live up to the rising expectations of millennial customers, and set themselves apart from rivals. Payoda also offers centralised data and management of accounts with the aid of cloud computing, which can ultimately aid in streamlining business procedures for the BFSI sector. Their end-to-end transformation services offer a thorough framework that can give portfolio managers more accurate information. A gri-Tech: Indian farmers’ lives are being gradually impacted by agricultural technology, which makes their hard work simpler, increases productivity, and guarantees that they have access to much-needed services. Post-harvest logistics have been transformed by Sohan Lal Commodity Management (SLCM), giving farmers access to larger, higher-paying markets. More than 1.5 lakh stakeholders have come together thanks to their listing platform, Agri Reach, which guarantees that everyone will profit in turn. Additionally, the program instantly permits online quality checks for crops with NABL-accredited labs, a job that formerly took two days. Agri Suraksha has enabled the creation of smart warehouses that are continuously monitored by CCTV powered by solar energy. With the aid of timestamps, this guarantees that malpractices are reduced while the produce is kept safe in the warehouses. Nevertheless, the adoption of these technological advancements by Indian farmers remains sluggish. Consequently, a “Phygital” ecosystem is required, in which physical centers are digitalized to offer the necessary support to farmers. F ood-Tech: The way people cook has been altered by many gadgets, but few have been as innovative as the BlendJet, a portable blender that uses its patented TurboJet technology to move 275 revolutions per second and literally produce a tornado. The BlendJet 2, their most recent model, can prepare anything you want in as little as 20 seconds. Additionally, this portable blender uses a USB charging cord to provide you with 15 full whips anytime, anyplace. You may prepare coffee, frozen fruit lattes, hummus, chutneys, gravies, smoothies, dips, and more. For people who enjoy cooking, this gadget is ideal because it will save them a great deal of time. Health- Tech: We all live in a time when maintaining one’s health is crucial. Particularly in the post-Covid era, we have all grown more health-conscious. Annual or biannual physicals, however, are insufficient because one requires up-to-date health measurements right away. One company that has introduced a variety of smartwatches with an emphasis on the Health Suite is Pebble. It includes stress monitors, SpO2 monitors, and heart rate monitors. You can be confident that you are constantly moving and that you can reach the daily requirement of 10,000 steps thanks to the integrated pedometer. Some smartwatches even feature sedentary reminders, hydration reminders, and a feature called Zen Mode that lets you unwind even in the middle of a busy day.

    "article_content": "Apps Listicle Three Ways Businesses in India Can Drive Sales This Diwali October 25, 2023 technuter 0 Comments As India prepares to celebrate Diwali, businesses have a great opportunity to connect with customers during this festival season. For many businesses, this means using WhatsApp to engage with customers in a convenient and reliable way on the app they’re already using throughout the day. In fact, 8 out of 10 people in India say that messaging is their preferred way of communicating with a business. To keep businesses on track and to engage better with their customers, here are three WhatsApp strategies that businesses can continue doing to drive more sales. 1. Create a great messaging experience for customers (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); For many small business owners in India, WhatsApp is their business – their website or virtual store counter to showcase products, answer customer queries and drive sales. So when customers come, you need to be ready. During Diwali, that might be as simple as updating your business hours in your business profile in the WhatsApp Business app to let people know you’re open during the celebration – especially if your operating hours will be different than usual – or even putting up an away message to inform customers when you’re available or when you might be enjoying the festivities. And if you have any special items or deals and promotions, it’s best to highlight that in your catalog so people can easily find what they might want to buy. For larger businesses using the WhatsApp Business Platform, this could mean taking your WhatsApp experience a step further by creating an end-to-end shopping experience for your customers with a new custom “flow,” and enabling in-app checkout with the WhatsApp payments feature. 2. Attract new customers The lifeblood of any business is finding more customers. So once you’ve built a valuable experience for your customers, it’s key to drive more people to your WhatsApp channel. To start, add a QR code to your storefront, website, product packaging, marketing materials or any other surface where people coming across your business can easily scan to connect with you on WhatsApp. From there, you can add a WhatsApp button to your Facebook or Instagram account that clicks to open a chat on WhatsApp so customers browsing your business on those platforms can easily start a conversation to ask questions or place an order. To find a brand new set of customers, businesses can take the next step and create Facebook or Instagram ads that click to open a chat on WhatsApp. These ads are an incredibly effective and powerful way to attract new customers and get them to start messaging with your business so you can close the sale. For businesses that run their entire operation directly from WhatsApp, you can now create these ads directly within the WhatsApp Business app. 3. Stay organized Diwali can be an extremely busy week for businesses – especially with so much commerce condensed into just a few days. With a potential influx of chats coming from new customers, it’s essential to keep your business and chats organized to maximize efficiency and sales. One trick is using catalog collections to group and organize products into specific categories so it’s simple for customers to browse your offerings. To stay on top of your chats, label specific ones with customizable descriptions to keep track of things like pending payments, new customers and more. As your customer base and chat volume grow, businesses can graduate from the WhatsApp Business app to the more powerful WhatsApp Business Platform where they can engage with customers at scale.

    "article_content": "E-commerce Listicle Amazon best-selling RAMs to buy for your laptop May 11, 2023 technuter 0 Comments One of the new generations of storage devices designed to take the place of conventional mechanical hard discs is the solid-state drive, or SSD. SSDs are superior because they employ flash-based memory, which is not only speedier but also more dependable. Computers and laptops are now faster than ever because to SSDs’ benefits of high throughput and quick read access. The SSDs’ read/write speeds, measured in nanoseconds, store files in various grids that provide quick access to any information needed. There are just a few names that can be entirely trusted for the purpose, despite the fact that many SSD storage businesses have emerged in recent years. INTEL (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Intel, a different worldwide leader in the market, has throughout the years provided a variety of SSDs to meet different demands and uses. The company just debuted the P5800X SSD, which many industry insiders claim to be the fastest SSD ever. The SSDs made available by Intel are renowned for their improved consistency, reduced latency, and more stable performance. However, because of their higher price range, most Intel SSDs are seen to be best suited for large enterprises. The brand has traditionally concentrated on drastically increasing the sequential speeds. ACER Predator Apollo The multinational Taiwanese hardware and electronics company is a market leader in storage goods, providing a wide range of memory and storage options for business and household consumers. Acer SSDs are built to support LDPC ECC technology for data integrity as well as S.M.A.R.T., GC & TRIM, and S.M.A.R.T. features that preserve optimal system performance. M.2 SATA, 2.5-inch SATA, and M.2 PCIe NVMe SSDs are all part of Acer’s new SSD line. The RE100 is available in 2.5″ SATA and the smaller M.2 form factor, whereas the entry-level 2.5″ SA100 SATA SSD is offered in sizes ranging from 120 GB to 1.92 TB. SAMSUNG Samsung is a prominent global producer of electronic components, including SSDs, as well as home appliances. It is a South Korean multinational business. There are gaming SSDs for complete gaming immersion and Terabyte SSDs to improve the whole computing experience, but Samsung SSDs like the 970 Pro are designed to withstand demanding workloads on consumer PCs. The SSDs from Samsung with SATA interface are expected to quickly and significantly enhance the entire computer experience. WESTERN DIGITAL A major leader in the market, Western Digital, usually known as WD, offers Solid State Hard Drives with capacities ranging from 250 MB to an enormous 32 TB. The business has always placed a strong emphasis on innovation, and in addition to being one of the first companies to produce hard drives, it has recently made some important advancements in 3D NAND. Zoned storage, one of the brand’s hallmark products, operates on a unified software architecture that intelligently puts data to maximise storage capacity, reduce TCO, and enhance QoS.

    "article_content": "Listicle 10 powerful features introduced on myBillBook to boost business activities for SMBs May 17, 2023 technuter 0 Comments myBillBook, India’s leading GST billing and accounting software for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs), in a mega update, has launched 10 new features on the platform aimed at simplifying business operations for SMBs. These new features are designed to assist SMBs in conducting business more easily and efficiently, providing them with a comprehensive suite of tools to manage their invoicing, accounting, payroll, marketing, customer relation management needs. With these additions, myBillBook is further strengthening its positioning as a one-stop solution for SMBs, leveraging technology to solve critical pain points and enable digitization for businesses in India. Over the last three years since its launch, myBillBook by FloBiz has already helped over 70 lakh businesses in India grow by enabling digitization of their day-to-day business operations and management from anywhere, anytime. Built from a customer-first approach, myBillBook is available on Android, iOS and desktop and can be accessed both online and offline, making it convenient for businesses to use in any situation. With its advanced core functionalities such as GST/Non-GST billing, e-Way billing, POS billing, and e-Invoicing, small and medium businesses generate trades worth INR 12,500 Cr on myBillBook every month, showcasing its widespread adoption and impact on the SMB community. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The new capabilities introduced by myBillBook are a result of deep consumer research which are in line with the company’s objective of “Building For Bharat” or developing technological solutions for the emerging India. These features and modules have been designed to suit Indian SMBs’ persona in a way that they are intuitive to use, yet powerful and cover the wide spectrum of use cases for different industries. These include: WhatsApp Marketing: Users can now promote their businesses through bulk marketing campaigns on WhatsApp and analyze the return on investment (RoI) of these campaigns. The brand-new and easy-to-use templates available on the platform will enable small business owners to announce and publicise various activities such as discounts, promotions, seasonal sales, and festivals. Staff Attendance & Payroll Management: This is a dedicated module which enables business owners to mark the attendance of their employees, add advance payments, and manage staff payroll. Automated Bills: SMBs can now set up recurring invoices for retainer-type services to their clients, thereby eliminating the need for manual invoice creation every month. This saves not just a lot of time for business owners but also removes errors and discrepancies. Users are just required to set services rendered, frequency & reminder schedule and the software takes care of automatically generating & sharing professional invoices to customers and clients. GSTR in JSON: Users can download and email their GSTR1 files in JSON format for easy uploading to the GST portal or sharing with accountants, along with 25 other important reports. Generate E-Way bills on Mobile: This latest feature will provide users the ability to generate e-way bills on mobile phones. This feature has been available on myBillBook’s web app so far but it has recently been integrated into its mobile application as well. This feature makes the bill generation process completely automated, and the user can send error-free e-way bills to the parties of their choice right from their mobile phones. Balance Sheet: With this new capability, SMBs can now generate balance sheets directly on myBillBook and have a comprehensive and consolidated view of their business financials while maintaining compliance of their enterprises. Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Users can set and send service reminders to buyers and sellers, as well as set notifications for upcoming appointments. Features like birthday reminders are also included to enhance customer delight. Loyalty Programs: Business owners can now set up loyalty programs for their customers to support them in retaining customers for a long term by converting loyalty points directly into discounts on future purchases and avoid their customer churn post sales. The exclusive loyalty programs will enhance the relationship of SMBs with existing clients and attract new clients with attractive offers. Multiple Bank Accounts: Users can now manage multiple bank accounts and payment modes, making it easier to reconcile payments received and made from different accounts. Data Export to Tally: Users can seamlessly export all myBillBook data to Tally, a popular accounting software, making it easier to manage their business data and reports. “Understanding the use cases and solving the pain points of our users through technology-led solutions is core to our philosophy. We’re thrilled to launch these new features and capabilities on myBillBook and strongly believe these would prove to be a game-changer for our users. In addition to core functionalities around invoicing, reports, inventory management, payments and accounting, myBillBook now also provides features for customer engagement, marketing, staff management and loyalty. myBillBook is steadily evolving into a one-stop solution and a complete business management software which simplifies operational processes and improves business efficiency on-the-go”, said Rahul Raj, CEO & Co-founder, FloBiz. The new features introduced by myBillBook will help users improve their customer experience through streamlined CRM, service reminders, and WhatsApp Marketing. The addition of features for managing staff attendance and payroll, as well as advancements in accounting features such as providing balance sheets and GSTR in JSON format, will contribute to the acceleration of digitization for SMBs in building robust mobile-first solutions and addressing the pressing problems of the Indian SMB sector, in line with the vision of building an Aatmanirbhar Bharat.
